AB Autonomous vehicle advancements and communication technologies such as V2V, V2I, and V2X have enabled the development of connected and autonomous vehicles. Because CAVs are directly effective in traffic, their application in traffic management and incident management appears promising. They can immediately begin regulating traffic and acting as sensors due to their connectivity to the infrastructure. This research proposes Incident Detection Included Linear Management (IDILIM), a CAV-based incident management algorithm that regulates CAV and traffic speeds based on dynamic and predicted shockwave speeds. The SUMO simulations are carried out on a 10.4-km-long, three-lane facility with 21 sensors every 500 m. In the scenarios, three traffic demands, eleven CAV penetration rates, and varying incident locations, duration, and lanes are used. A total of 20 simulation seeds are used in each scenario. The proposed algorithm necessitates the use of a reliable traffic prediction model. Convolutional Neural Networks, a deep learning algorithm with high estimation accuracy, are used in the prediction model. IDILIM uses the highly accurate traffic prediction output of the Pix-to-Pix model as input at 3-min intervals. Shockwave speed is calculated using model outputs and fed to CAVs. To compare with IDILIM, variable speed limits (VSL) are also modeled. When compared to uncontrolled base scenarios, IDILIM reduced density values greater than 35 veh/km in the critical region by 89.32%. In the same scenario, VSL management decreased by only 52.43%.

AB The purpose of this article is to develop an online method to identify the hydrodynamic coefficients of pitch plane of an autonomous underwater vehicle. To obtain necessary data for the identification, the dive plane dynamics should be excited through diving maneuvers. Hence, a controller is needed whose performance and stability are appropriate. To design such a controller, first, hydrodynamic coefficients are approximated using semi-empirical methods. Based on these approximated coefficients, a classic controller is designed at the next step. Since the estimation of these coefficients is uncertain, mu-analysis is employed to verify the robustness of stability and performance of the controller. Using the verified robust controller, some oscillating maneuvers are carried out that excite the dive plane dynamics. Using sensor fusion and unscented Kalman filter, smooth and high-rate data of depth is provided for the depth controller. A recursive identification algorithm is developed to identify the hydrodynamic coefficients of heave and pitch motions. It turns out that some inputs required by the identification are not measured directly by the sensors. But the devised fusion algorithm is able to provide the necessary data for identification. Finally, using the identified coefficients and employing pole placement method, a new controller with better performance is synthesized online. To evaluate the performance of the identification and fusion algorithms, a 6-degree-of-freedom simulation of an autonomous underwater vehicle is carried out.

AB To integrate large scale renewable energy sources in the power grid, the battery energy storage performs an important role for smoothing their natural intermittency and ensuring grid-wide frequency stability. Electric vehicles have not only large introduction potential but also much available time for control because they are almost plugged in the home outlets as distributed battery energy storages. Therefore, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) is expected to be one of the key technologies in smart grid strategies. This paper proposes an autonomous distributed V2G control scheme. A grid-connected electric vehicle supplies a distributed spinning reserve according to the frequency deviation at the plug-in terminal, which is a signal of supply and demand imbalance in the power grid. As a style of EV utilization, it is assumed that vehicle use set next plug-out timing in advance. In such assumption, user convenience is satisfied by performing a scheduled charging for the plug-out, and plug-in idle time is available for the V2G control. Therefore a smart charging control is considered in the proposed scheme. Satisfaction of vehicle user convenience and effect to the load frequency control is evaluated through a simulation by using a typical two area interconnected power grid model and an automotive lithium-ion battery model.

AB A four-wheel steering four-wheel drive electric vehicle has a steering motor and a driving motor for each wheel, for a total of eight motors. Almost all of the existing path-tracking controllers for this vehicle are designed by viewing the mathematical model of the vehicle as the system of equations. (x) over dot = f (x, u), y = h(x, u), and are mathematically sophisticated. In contrast, this brief presents a block diagrammatic representation of the model, and exploits the natural feedback loops revealed through this representation to develop two novel and useful results: 1) a mathematically simpler path-tracking controller that promises to be easier to tune and 2) a constraint on the wheel accelerations that helps constrain the wheel slips to a desired value. Simulations illustrate this solution.

AB In response to the widespread adoption of vehicle-following systems in autonomous applications, the demand for collision warning to enable safer functionalities is increasing. This study provides an approach for automated vehicle guidance to follow the preceding vehicles longitudinally and puts emphasis on the performance of collision avoidance. The safety distance model is established, which contains a distance compensation algorithm to deal with the special case on curved roads. By introducing the algorithm of velocity and distance prediction, the collision risks are detected and measured in real time. The objective function is established based on optimal control theory to solve the desired following acceleration. The control system designed with the method of proportion integration differentiation combines throttle percentage and brake pressure as outputs to compensate acceleration. In the Carsim and Simulink co-simulation platform, the control system for longitudinal collision avoidance is simulated and analysed for four typical working conditions: the preceding vehicle drives at a constant speed on straight and curved roads, while the preceding vehicle drives at various speeds on straight and curved roads. The results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, which can be used for the longitudinal control of vehicle-following active collision avoidance.

TI Driver Intent Prediction and Collision Avoidance With Barrier Functions
SO IEEE-CAA JOURNAL OF AUTOMATICA SINICA
LA English
DT Article
AB For autonomous vehicles and driver assist systems, path planning and collision avoidance algorithms benefit from accurate predictions of future location of other vehicles and intent of their drivers. In the literature, the algorithms that provide driver intent belong to two categories: those that use physics based models with some type of filtering, and machine learning based approaches. In this paper we employ barrier functions (BF) to decide driver intent. BFs are typically used to prove safety by establishing forward invariance of an admissible set. Here, we decide if the "target " vehicle is violating one or more possibly fictitious (i.e., non-physical) barrier constraints determined based on the context provided by the road geometry. The algorithm has a very small computational footprint and better false positive and negative rates than some of the alternatives. The predicted intent is then used by a control barrier function (CBF) based collision avoidance system to prevent unnecessary interventions, for either an autonomous or human-driven vehicle.

AB This brief proposes a three-dimensional flow field estimation algorithm using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and local measurements. Taking into account the fact of negligible vertical velocity, the layered flow field model is established in a three-dimensional scene, which incorporates the property of incompressibility and increases the span of model parameters. The flow field affects the movement of each vehicle and it may result in motion-integration errors when comparing its predicted movement. Meanwhile, local measurements of the unknown flow field are stored as time-dependent variables due to the lack of position while vehicles are submerged. Then, we formulate the nonlinear constraints based on the motion-integration errors and local measurements. The cooperative algorithm is proposed to solve the flow field estimation problem composed of these constraints and the effectiveness of the proposed estimation algorithm is validated with simulations.

AB Edge-assisted vehicle-to-everything (V2X) motion planning is an emerging paradigm to achieve safe and efficient autonomous driving, since it leverages the global position information shared among multiple vehicles. However, due to the imperfect channel state information (CSI), the position information of vehicles may become outdated and inaccurate. Conventional methods ignoring the communication delays could severely jeopardize driving safety. To fill this gap, this article proposes a robust V2X motion planning policy that adapts between competitive driving under a low communication delay and conservative driving under a high communication delay, and guarantees small communication delays at key waypoints via power control. This is achieved by integrating the vehicle mobility and communication delay models and solving a joint design of motion planning and power control problem via the block coordinate descent framework. Simulation results show that the proposed driving policy achieves the smallest collision ratio compared with other benchmark policies.

AB In this paper, we propose a lane change decision scheme using only commercial, automotive radar sensors with "DRiving Environment Assessment and decision Making (DREAM) index." First, the index associated with a risk situation is assessed by the concept of a dynamic occupancy grid zone. The predefined distance of the local area was set to conform to the international standard of a steering function. Also, the risk assessment was predictively conducted using modeling of the relative motion with a target vehicle. Second, the index associated with a cooperative driving concept of the surrounding vehicles is proposed. To estimate the relative acceleration which is not directly measured by radar, we designed a discrete-time state estimator. We executed scenario-based experiments with test vehicles in a high-speed circuit to validate the decision scheme. Through the experiments, we observed that the DREAM index could make effective decisions, and the lane change maneuverings 7were performed successfully in real-world tests.

AB To provide a service that guarantees driver comfort and safety, a platform utilizing connected car big data is required. This study first aims to design and develop such a platform to improve the function of providing vehicle and road condition information of the previously defined central Local Dynamic Map (LDM). Our platform extends the range of connected car big data collection from OBU (On Board Unit) and CAN to camera, LiDAR, and GPS sensors. By using data of vehicles being driven, the range of roads available for analysis can be expanded, and the road condition determination method can be diversified. Herein, the system was designed and implemented based on the Hadoop ecosystem, i.e., Hadoop, Spark, and Kafka, to collect and store connected car big data. We propose a direction of the cooperative intelligent transport system (C-ITS) development by showing a plan to utilize the platform in the C-ITS environment.

AB Among surrounding information-gathering devices, cameras are the most accessible and widely used in autonomous vehicles. In particular, stereo cameras are employed in academic as well as practical applications. In this study, commonly used webcams are mounted on a vehicle in a dual-camera configuration and used to perform lane detection based on image correction. The height, baseline, and angle were considered as variables for optimizing the mounting positions of the cameras. Then, a theoretical equation was proposed for the measurement of the distance to the object, and it was validated via vehicle tests. The optimal height, baseline, and angle of the mounting position of the dual camera configuration were identified to be 40 cm, 30 cm, and 12 degrees, respectively. These values were utilized to compare the performances of vehicles in stationary and driving states on straight and curved roads, as obtained by vehicle tests and theoretical calculations. The comparison revealed the maximum error rates in the stationary and driving states on a straight road to be 3.54% and 5.35%, respectively, and those on a curved road to be 9.13% and 9.40%, respectively. It was determined that the proposed method is reliable because the error rates were less than 10%.

AB Purpose
   Autonomous driving depends on the collection, processing and analysis of environmental information and vehicle information. Environmental perception and processing are important prerequisite for the safety of self-driving of vehicles; it involves road boundary detection, vehicle detection, pedestrian detection using sensors such as laser rangefinder, video camera, vehicle borne radar, etc.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Subjected to various environmental factors, the data clock information is often out of sync because of different data acquisition frequency, which leads to the difficulty in data fusion. In this study, according to practical requirements, a multi-sensor environmental perception collaborative method was first proposed; then, based on the principle of target priority, large-scale priority, moving target priority and difference priority, a multi-sensor data fusion optimization algorithm based on convolutional neural network was proposed.
   Findings
   The average unload scheduling delay of the algorithm for test data before and after optimization under different network transmission rates. It can be seen that with the improvement of network transmission rate and processing capacity, the unload scheduling delay decreased after optimization and the performance of the test results is the closest to the optimal solution indicating the excellent performance of the optimization algorithm and its adaptivity to different environments.
   Originality/value
   In this paper, the results showed that the proposed method significantly improved the redundancy and fault tolerance of the system thus ensuring fast and correct decision-making during driving.

DE autonomous underwater vehicles; terrain-based navigation; acoustic

AB This paper presents a decentralized communication planning algorithm for cooperative terrain-based navigation (dec-TBN) with autonomous underwater vehicles. The proposed algorithm uses forward simulation to approximate the value of communicating at each time step. The simulations are used to build a directed acyclic graph that can be searched to provide a minimum cost communication schedule. Simulations and field trials are used to validate the algorithm. The simulations use a real-world bathymetry map from Lake Nighthorse, CO, and a sensor model derived from an Ocean Server Iver2 vehicle. The simulation results show that the algorithm finds a communication schedule that reduces communication bandwidth by 86% and improves robot localization by up to 27% compared to non-cooperative terrain-based navigation. Field trials were conducted in Foster Reservoir, OR, using two Riptide Autonomous Solutions micro-unmanned underwater vehicles. The vehicles collected GPS, altimeter, acoustic communications, and dead reckoning data while following paths on the surface of the reservoir. The data were used to evaluate the planning algorithm. In three of four missions, the planning algorithm improved dec-TBN localization while reducing acoustic communication bandwidth by 56%. In the fourth mission, dec-TBN performed better when using full communications bandwidth, but the communication policy for that mission maintained 86% of the localization accuracy while using 9% of the communications. These results indicate that the presented communication planning algorithm can maintain or improve dec-TBN accuracy while reducing the number of communications used for localization.

AB Malicious software (malware) is both a hurdle to autonomous vehicle (AV) adoption and a serious threat to AV occupant safety. Yet, to date, the topic of how subnational transportation decision makers should handle this cybersecurity threat has been underexplored. This paper describes how malware can spread through vehicle-to-X networks and infect AVs to a non-technical planning audience. It then explains how AV malware can cluster spatially in linguistic, socioeconomic, and political enclaves of American cities. Since AVs can identify new indicators of safety imperceptible to humans, malware clusters can produce new geographies of accessibility, mobility, economic, and environmental inequity across a city. In provisioning the inherently localized technical malware prevention tools available to them, subnational transportation planners have the capacity to reproduce or overcome historical and current transportation system inequities.

ID COVERAGE CONTROL
AB This brief presents a distributed deployment algorithm for a network of heterogeneous mobile agents to minimize a prescribed cost function. This function is concerned with the cost of serving the entire field by all agents, where the so called operation cost of different agents are not necessarily the same. The problem is investigated for the case where agents have different types of dynamics. Using a multiplicatively-weighted Voronoi diagram, the field is partitioned to smaller regions (one for each agent). A distributed coverage control law is then provided that guarantees the convergence of agents to the optimal configuration with respect to the above-mentioned cost function. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by simulations and experiments on a testbed with two types of unmanned vehicles (aerial and ground).

AB In this paper, a novel adaptive neural network (NN) controller is proposed for trajectory tracking of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). By employing radial basic function neural network to account for modeling errors, then the adaptive NN tracking controller is constructed by combining the dynamic surface control (DSC) and the minimal learning parameter (MLP). The proposed controller guarantees that all the close-loop signals are uniform ultimate bounded (UUB) and that the tracking errors converge to a small neighborhood of the desired trajectory. Finally, simulation studies are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Designed to operate in a heterogeneous, multivehicle collaboration hierarchy, the presented vehicle design features 3D printing technology to enable fast fabrication with a complex internal structure. Similar to a previous vehicle prototype, this system generates propulsive forces by expelling unsteady, pulsed jets, inspired by the locomotion of cephalopods and jellyfish. The novel thrusters enable the vehicle to be fully actuated in horizontal plane motions, without sacrificing the low-forward-drag, slender vehicle profile. By successively ingesting water and expelling finite water jets, periodic actuation forces are generated at all possible vehicle velocities, eliminating the need for control surfaces used in many conventional underwater vehicle designs. A semiactive buoyancy control system, inspired by the nautilus, adjusts the vehicle depth by passively allowing water flowing into and actively expelling water out of an internal bladder. A compact embedded system is developed to achieve the control and sensing capabilities necessary for multiagent interactions with the minimum required processing power and at a low energy cost. The new vehicle design also showcases an underwater optical communication system for short-range, high-speed data transmission, supplementing the conventional acoustic communication system. Experimental results show that, with the thruster motors powered at a 60% duty-cycle, the new vehicle is able to achieve a 1/4 zero-radius turn in 3.5 s and one-body-width sway translation in 2.5 s.

AB Microgrids are assumed to be established at the low voltage distribution level, where distributed energy sources, storage devices, controllable loads and electric vehicles are integrated in the system and need to be properly managed. The microgrid system is a flexible cell that can be operated connected to the main power network or autonomously, in a controlled and coordinated way. The use of storage devices in microgrids is related to the provision of some form of energy buffering during autonomous operating conditions, in order to balance load and generation. However, frequency variations and limited storage capacity might compromise microgrid autonomous operation. In order to improve microgrid resilience in the moments subsequent to islanding, this paper presents innovative functionalities to run online, which are able to manage microgrid storage considering the integration of electric vehicles and load responsiveness. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is validated through extensive numerical simulations.

AB One of the key challenges in the development and implementation of ocean observatories is sustained observations over relevant temporal and spatial scales. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have demonstrated their potential for synoptic spatial coverage of regions of scientific and strategic interest. The range and duration of these systems are limited, however, to the capabilities of a single charge. A few efforts have been made to develop docking systems for propeller-driven vehicles; however, these systems are not applicable for buoyancy-driven gliders and cannot be universally applied to AUVs. Here the authors introduce an alternative strategy for AUV docking, demonstrate feasibility with a series of field tests using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to remotely recover an AUV, and comment on the scalability within the framework of the evolving global ocean observatory initiatives. Implementation of simple strategies such as this has the potential to reduce the chronic problem of undersampling in the ocean and may facilitate addressing some outstanding scientific questions related to the ocean.

AB This paper describes a solution to the problem of bottom-following for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that relies on the evaluation of the terrain characteristics ahead of the vehicle using echo sounders. The methodology used poses the problem as a discrete time path following control problem where a conveniently defined error state space model of the plant is augmented with bathymetric (i.e., depth) preview data. A piecewise affine parameter-dependent model representation is adopted that describes the AUV linearized error dynamics for a predefined set of operating regions. For each region, a state feedback H-2 control problem for affine parameter-dependent systems is posed and solved using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The resulting nonlinear controller is implemented as a gain-scheduled controller using the D-methodology. Simulation results obtained with a nonlinear dynamic model of the INFANTE AUV in the vertical plane are presented and discussed.

AB Backlash phenomena have haunted control engineers for ages. Concerning the ground vehicle path-tracking control system design, the steering system's backlash attribute is often overlooked. If not properly compensated, the backlash nonlinearity tends to provoke unfavorable consequences including erroneous positioning of the road-wheel steering angle, response chattering, limit-cycle-like oscillations, and delays. This paper pioneers to employ an adaptive inverse controller to offset the dynamics of the steering system's backlash. Overall, the path-following objective is accomplished via a novel trio-loop control architecture, which decomposes the tracking objectives into kinematic, vehicular lateral dynamics, and steering backlash compensation sub-levels. All adaptive control laws are robustified by means of sigma modification. Hardware-in-the-loop experimental results are presented to demonstrate the superiorities of the proposed solution.

The motivation of this paper is the research on the novel smart actuators for autonomous urban vehicles, by which various functionalities can be achieved. The goal of this paper is to propose a control design for trajectory tracking with increased reachability domain. Therefore, in this paper, the hierarchical control design of the suspension system using robust and linear-parameter varying (LPV) methods is presented. The robust stability of the hierarchy is guaranteed through the modeling of the uncertainties of different control layers. Furthermore, the coordination of independent steering and torque vectoring is proposed, which is based on a nonlinear reachability analysis of the interventions. The efficiency of the prosed method is presented through the high-complexity simulation software of the vehicle dynamics (CarSim) and the suspension construction (SimMechanics).

DE Autonomous vehicles; ethics; moral dilemma; trolley; industry; companies
AB The onset of autonomous driving has provided fertile ground for discussions about ethics in recent years. These discussions are heavily documented in the scientific literature and have mainly revolved around extreme traffic situations depicted as moral dilemmas, i.e. situations in which the autonomous vehicle (AV) is required to make a difficult moral choice. Quite surprisingly, little is known about the ethical issues in focus by the AV industry. General claims have been made about the struggles of companies regarding the ethical issues of AVs but these lack proper substantiation. As private companies are highly influential on the development and acceptance of AV technologies, a meaningful debate about the ethics of AVs should take into account the ethical issues prioritised by industry. In order to assess the awareness and engagement of industry on the ethics of AVs, we inspected the narratives in the official business and technical reports of companies with an AV testing permit in California. The findings of our literature and industry review suggest that: (i) given the plethora of ethical issues addressed in the reports, autonomous driving companies seem to be aware of and engaged in the ethics of autonomous driving technology; (ii) scientific literature and industry reports prioritise safety and cybersecurity; (iii) scientific and industry communities agree that AVs will not eliminate the risk of accidents; (iv) scientific literature on AV technology ethics is dominated by discussions about the trolley problem; (v) moral dilemmas resembling trolley cases are not addressed in industry reports but there are nuanced allusions that unravel underlying concerns about these extreme traffic situations; (vi) autonomous driving companies have different approaches with respect to the authority of remote operators; and (vii) companies seem invested in a lowest liability risk design strategy relying on rules and regulations, expedite investigations, and crash/collision avoidance algorithms.

AB In this paper, we suggest a new approach for tuning parameters of fuzzy controllers based on reinforcement learning. The architecture of the proposed approach is comprised of a Q estimator network (QEN) and a Takagi-Sugeno-type fuzzy inference system (TSK-FIS). Unlike other fuzzy Q-learning approaches that select an optimal action based on finite discrete actions, the proposed controller obtains the control output directly from TSK-FIS. With the proposed architecture, the learning algorithms for all the parameters of the QEN and the FIS are developed based on the temporal-difference (TD) methods as well as the gradient-descent algorithm. The performance of the proposed design technique is illustrated by simulation studies of a vehicle longitudinal-control system.

A UAV model with nonlinear dynamic constraints provides more natural accommodation of the vehicle's constraints than a kinematic model with linear constraints. This paper presents a method for using finite horizon model predictive control with a custom solver that offers low solution time. A comparative study of a high-fidelity model and a lower-fidelity counterpart is presented. Using the proposed method, the high-fidelity model provides better trajectories than the lower-fidelity counterpart, despite both having low computational requirement for onboard trajectory generation in an embedded platform.

AB The paper describes a multi controller concept, which provides different lateral and longitudinal controllers for full-autonomous experiments. After a description of the practical requirements on such a system, a lateral control strategy based on exact input/output linearization is proposed, that is derived from two sing le-track-vehicle models with different scopes. The lateral controller features robustness against errors in GPS measurement and path-planning, as well as low requirements on the path geometry, which is of major importance for the prototypical application in practice. The realization of velocity, following, and stopping control is done by an override control strategy, which asserts bumpless transfer between the different control objectives. The developed multi controller is tested in experiments with different scenarios and the results are presented in detail.

AB In this paper a multi-agent architecture of an Autonomous Robot Navigator for a vehicle that operates in dynamic real-world environments is presented. The vehicle is capable of executing different navigation missions while smoothly avoiding static obstacles in its path as well as moving objects. The navigator architecture is part of a general multi-agent cognitive framework, which is organised into three non-hierarchical components characterised by the type of knowledge they deal with: a symbolic component, handling a declarative explicit propositional formalism, a diagrammatic component, dealing with analogical, iconic representations, and a reactive behaviour based component. The navigator is distributed in all three components combining motion planning on a topological graph with reactive motion planning techniques. It is on these aspects that the paper focuses. Experimental results with our mobile robot will also be provided.

AB As a promising technology, connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) can reduce energy consumption and improve transportation safety. Nevertheless, as more enabling technologies are embedded in vehicles, the CAV is becoming more vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. Priority must be given to highly sensitive, life-threatening vulnerabilities. Therefore, an improved vulnerability assessment method for CAVs is proposed in this arti-cle, in which the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) and Bayes theory are adopted. Compared to the classical CVSS method, our scheme considers the impact of exploited vulnerabilities on the real world. In the meantime, a Bayesian network vulnerability classification model based on the CVSSCAV method is designed to resolve the problem that the CAVs' vulnerability dataset is small and incomplete. The case study as well as simulation results with different datasets or algorithms indicate that our proposal is effective for vehicle vulnerability evaluation.

AB Plug-in electric vehicles within a decarbonized electricity sector offer a remedy for pollution mitigation in the transportation sector. In this paper, a decomposed planning model for optimal transition to electric vehicle in the deep decarbonization pathway project considering electricity grid constraints is developed. A bi-level charging/discharging control for plug-in electric vehicles is proposed to increase the penetration of electric vehicles in a planning horizon. Moreover, an integrated model of electricity and transportation sectors is developed in to investigate the impact of autonomous electric vehicles as a clean disruptive technology for electric vehicles. The proposed planning model is able to determine whether the existing and future electricity grid infrastructure can meet the growing electrified transportation load in the near future or not. Hence, a Bayesian decision-based conjoint method for developing a heterogeneous transportation demand model is applied. The proposed planning model is carried out on Ontario's grid and a six-bus test system to corroborate the capability of the proposed planning model. According to the obtained results in Ontario's grid, penetration of plug-in electric vehicles is increased to 30% by 2025 while the total CO2 emission is decreased by 28% compared to the case with no electric vehicle charging/discharging management and disruptive technology.

AB Interconnected and autonomous vehicles are proven to be helpful in reducing traffic congestion and dangerous emissions while enhancing safety on our roads. In this context, the present paper introduces a human-inspired Adaptive Cruise Control dedicated to improving the passenger experience using Model Predictive Control and traffic macroscopic information. To better describe the characteristics of human drivers, first a human-inspired microscopic hybrid automaton is considered, and an optimization problem targeting consumption minimization and collision avoidance is designed with a receding horizon approach. Then, traffic macroscopic information is included in the controller definition so that a mesoscopic Adaptive Cruise Control model is obtained. Simulations showing the efficacy of the proposed approaches for safety and eco-driving are provided.

ID DRIVING STYLE RECOGNITION; DRIVER
AB By improving the ability of Trajectory Tracking Control (TTC) algorithms to mimic the manipulation behaviors of real drivers, which is of great significance in improving the personalized driving experience of autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose a TTC method that combines the Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) cognitive theory framework with the Preview Tracking (PT) theory. Firstly, by analyzing and describing the ACT-R cognitive framework and the PT theory, a TTC framework that combines the two theories is proposed. Secondly, a virtual driving simulator was built to collect driving data from 30 drivers and construct a driving memory database. Thirdly, a central production system for driver trajectory tracking is designed, which consists of: three control modes, production rules, a timing generator, and filtering methods for driving memory segments. Fourthly, the TTC method based on PT theory is designed to adapt to different control modes. Finally, statistical and comparative analyses of the human-like trajectory tracking results of the proposed method were carried out through co-simulation experiments, and it was verified that the human-like performance of the proposed new method had a high degree of similarity with the manipulation behaviors and the vehicle motion state of the real driver. The real-vehicle experiments are carried out, which verifies the consistency of the proposed method with the results of the simulation experiments.

AB Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) employ the point cloud data captured by LiDAR to enhance the capability of object recognition and detection. Edge computing with its inherent advantages can help CAVs alleviate resource constraints and enable faster situational awareness and data processing. However, the point cloud data contains private information, such as vehicle identity, location and trajectory, directly uploading the raw point cloud to the edge nodes or other vehicle will lead to serious privacy leakage. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to try to tackle this challenge and propose a privacy-preserving object detection framework over random point cloud shares for CAVs (referred to SecPCV), aiming to guarantee the privacy of both point cloud and object detection results. In SecPCV, CAVs split point cloud into two random shares based on additive secret sharing (ASS) and upload them to two competing edge nodes, respectively, which greatly compress the computational load of CAVs. Without changing the object detection network in plaintext environment, the edge nodes can cooperatively and securely extract, regress, and classify over point cloud shares. Theoretical analysis ensure the efficiency and security of the SecPCV framework. Experimental results with the real KITTI point cloud dataset indicate that SecPCV can achieve the consistent object detection accuracy as that in plaintext environment, and provide a feasible solution for CAVs secure sharing of point cloud data.

AB The pace of changes in automating cars has sped up in the last few decades. Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) will dramatically change the future of transportation, and household-level decisions will play a large role in the AV market. However, no data is readily available on household travel behavior using AVs. This study introduces a framework to assess households' adaptation to AV operations. We developed a mixed integer program, Household Activity Pattern Problem with AV (HAPPAV), to model traveler behavior under realistic conditions while using AVs. The model generates feasible activity patterns for household members under spatial and temporal constraints. The model is able to consider complete driverless operations, such as AV pick-up and drop-off, parking availability, empty trips, and carpooling. A decomposition method is developed to solve the NP-hard problem HAPPAV. The method includes two major stages; the first stage is to generate all feasible travel patterns for household members and the second stage finds the best AV route along with detailed travel patterns. We also use novel pruning rules to enhance the performance of the decomposition method. The model is applied on the California Statewide Travel Survey. The results indicate that 62% of households can perform their daily activities with only one AV in place of two or three regular vehicles. However, AV empty trips increase total VMT by 15%. The new method improves the average runtime and solution quality by 86% and 23%, respectively.

TI Black Knight: An autonomous vehicle for competition
SO JOURNAL OF ROBOTIC SYSTEMS

DT Article
AB Black Knight, the University of Central Florida's vehicle in the 11th Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition (IGVC) competed in 2003. Completing in 5th place in the navigational challenge and 10th in the autonomous challenge in its first competition has proven our vehicle to be a strong competitor in this competition. The vehicle has many interesting features that allow it to achieve its success. The vehicle's 300 lb. capacity allows for two onboard full-sized computers and two 12 V marine batteries that power the computers for up to 2 h. The vision system is not a simple reactive system but rather it classifies its view into objects and builds a map of the territory as it learns of its features while traveling. Two transformations and the location data from the GPS and other sensors are used to associate the locations in the image to locations in the map. The operations of the vehicle are modeled after the typical operations of a ship. We have programs that perform the functions of the captain, the helm, the navigator, and the engineer. In addition we have a program performing sensor data fusion from the GPS, compass, and wheel encoder data. The navigation uses an adapted two-dimensional approximate cell decomposition method that satisfies the nonholononic constraints of our vehicle and allows it to find the shortest path to the goal while avoiding all obstacles.

ID TRAJECTORY TRACKING; UNDERWATER VEHICLE
AB With respect to the accurate tracking control for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), this article proposes a novel control architecture consisting of piecewise compensation model predictive governor and conditional disturbance negation-based active disturbance rejection controller. The designed piecewise compensation mechanism is implemented to eliminate the steady tracking errors resulting from the underactuation problem of AUVs, and the model predictive governor aims to generate reference tracking velocities satisfying the constraints. Concurrently, a finite-time extended state observer is designed to improve the convergence performance of the estimation errors. In addition, the concept of conditional disturbance negation is employed to endow AUVs with the capability of taking advantage of disturbances rather than only rejecting disturbances. Finally, comprehensive analyses of the simulations and the experiments demonstrate the impressive control performance, verifying the feasibility of potential applications on real AUVs.

AB This paper presents a new robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm for trajectory tracking of an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) in presence of the time-varying external disturbances including winds, waves and ocean currents as well as dynamical uncertainties. For fullling the robustness property, a sliding mode control-based procedure for designing of MPC and a super-twisting term are adopted. The MPC algorithm has been known as an effective approach for the implementation simplicity and its fast dynamic response. The proposed hybrid controller has been implemented in MATLAB / Simulink environment. The results for the combined Model Predictive Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Control (MP-STSMC) algorithm have shown that it significantly outperforms conventional MPC algorithm in terms of the transient response, robustness and steady state response and presents an effective chattering attenuation in comparison with the Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Control (STSMC) algorithm.

TI Efficient Protection Mechanism Based on Self-Adaptive Decision for
   Communication Networks of Autonomous Vehicles
SO MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB The communication network of autonomous vehicles is composed of multiple sensors working together, and its dynamic topology makes it vulnerable to common attacks such as black hole attack, gray hole attack, rushing attack, and flooding attack, which pose a threat to the safety of passengers and vehicles; most of the existing safety detection mechanisms for a vehicle can only detect attacks but cannot intelligently defend against attacks. To this end, an efficient protection mechanism based on self-adaptive decision (SD-EPM) is proposed, which is divided into the offline phase and the online phase. The online phase consists of two parts: intrusion detection and efficient response. Attack detection and defense in the vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are performed in terms of the attack credibility value (AC), the network performance attenuation value (NPA), and the list of self-adaptive decision. The simulation results show that the proposed mechanism can correctly identify the attack and respond effectively to different attack types. And, the negative impact on VANETs is small.

AB For a long journey, the occupants of highly autonomous vehicles (HAV), with non-standard seating, can communicate easier. The question is. Are non-standard seating configurations as safe as standard seating in a frontal crash? The Virthuman model is used to answer this question. It is a multi-body system (MBS) model that helps run simulations faster, however, it lacks some outputs. A 30 km/h frontal acceleration pulse is applied to HAV's interior and a program determines injury indexes for Virthuman's body parts, then returns to simulation' settings, without considering injuries of the bodies' internal organs. Living Room seating provides safer conditions for its occupants in a frontal crash.

AB The last mile problem of E-grocery Distribution comprises one of the most costly and highest polluting components of the supply chain in which companies deliver goods to end customers. To reduce transport cost and fuel emissions, a new element of ground-based delivery services, autonomous delivery vehicles (ADVs), is included in the E-grocery distribution system for improving delivery efficiency. Thus, the objective of this study is to optimize a two-echelon distribution network for efficient E-grocery delivery, where conventional vans serve the delivery in the first echelon and ADVs serve delivery in the second echelon. The problem is formulated as a two-echelon vehicle routing problem with mixed vehicles (2E-VRP-MV) with a nonlinear objective function, in which the total transport and emission costs are optimized. This optimization is based on the flow assignment at each echelon and to realize routing choice for both the van and ADV. A two-step clustering-based hybrid Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (C-GA-PSO) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. First, the end customers are clustered to the intermediate depots, named satellites, based on the minimized distance and maximized demand. To enhance the efficiency of resolving the 2E-VRP-MV-model, a hybrid GA-PSO algorithm is adopted to solve the vehicle routing problem. Computational results of up to 21, 32, 50, and 100 customers show the effectiveness of the methods developed here. At last, the impacts of the layout of the depot-customer and customer density on the total cost are analyzed. This study sheds light on the tactical planning of the multi-echelon sustainable E-grocery delivery network.

AB The autonomous distribution systems used in smart parks against the background of Industry 5.0 require not only the consideration of the single goal of the economic benefits of enterprises, but also the fulfillment of their social responsibilities. Consequently, the scheduling of autonomous distribution systems and the trajectory planning of intelligent logistics vehicles have become increasingly more complex. Although technologies such as swarm intelligence have gradually been applied to the solution of independent distribution systems, there remain challenges in how to ensure that the production enterprises bear their responsibility to the public and consumers. Parallel system theory provides theoretical support for the concrete embodiment of people-oriented values in the smart park environment. In this work, based on parallel system theory, a parallel autonomous driving system is established. The system is mainly used for the autonomous transportation of finished products and materials in smart parks. The goal is to enhance the flexibility and efficiency of the distribution system in the park, and to highlight the people-oriented goal. Based on swarm intelligence theory and the A* algorithm, an improved swarm search optimization algorithm called IGSO-A* is developed to support the scheduling of parallel distribution systems and the trajectory planning of intelligent logistics vehicles. In two types of simulation experiments, compared with three other cutting-edge algorithms, the performance of the designed IGSO algorithm is improved by 4.6% on average. Moreover, compared with the A* algorithm, the performance of the proposed IGSO-A* algorithm is improved by 11.49%. The results prove the effectiveness of the proposed parallel autonomous distribution system in the distribution of finished products and materials in smart parks.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained significant interest for its potential to improve decision and control in autonomous driving. However, current approaches have yet to demonstrate sufficient scenario generality and observation generality, hindering their wider utilization. To address these limitations, we propose a unified benchmark simulator for RL algorithms (called IDSim) to facilitate decision and control for high-level autonomous driving, with emphasis on diverse scenarios and a unified observation interface. IDSim is composed of a scenario library and a simulation engine, and is designed with execution efficiency and determinism in mind. The scenario library covers common urban scenarios, with automated random generation of road structure and traffic flow, and the simulation engine operates on the generated scenarios with dynamic interaction support. We conduct four groups of benchmark experiments with five common RL algorithms and focus on challenging signalized intersection scenarios with varying conditions. The results showcase the reliability of the simulator and reveal its potential to improve the generality of RL algorithms. Our analysis suggests that multi-task learning and observation design are potential areas for further algorithm improvement.

DE Underwater; inspection; AUV; vehicle guidance
AB In this paper, a task-based online path-planning and guidance system of underactuated unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) for inspection of underwater infrastructure is described. Whether there are harbor submerged structures, cables, pipes, hydro-technical works, they all need to be checked in relation to structural deterioration specific potential problems such as scour, erosion, and accelerated local corrosion problems. At the highest level, the mission controller handles different event types, permitting also the execution of mission tasks. The online path-planning module generates a set of waypoints based on an environmental perception module for the AUV to follow the target object with a constant distance. The guidance method actually controls the vehicle to follow the waypoints, assuming the relative position and attitude of the vehicle is precisely estimated in real-time. By combining these methods, an AUV can perform fully autonomous inspection of underwater structures. The system was evaluated with success for several harbor and pipeline inspection scenarios in a test basin and sea trials.

AB A path following problem for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) under a nonuniform current is presented in this paper. A dynamic model of an AUV in a nonuniform flow was adopted to develop a high-gain observer (HGO) for estimation of the three-dimensional current velocities along AUV trajectories. The HGO was chosen as a nonlinear estimation algorithm, and the observer gain was computed by solving a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) which represented the estimation error dynamics. The current velocities were determined by calculating the differences between the measured absolute velocities of the vehicle and the estimated relative velocities of the vehicle estimated by the observer. The estimation error means of the HGO using the LMI have smaller values than the state observer with a gain matrix determined by the pole-placement approach. For the path following study, the desired curved path was represented by using a Serret-Frenet frame which propagated along the curve. The path-following system includes a guidance law, an update law and a proportional and integral controller. Two cases of numerical simulations were conducted to verify the performance of the path following system combined with HGO for current compensation, and the results of both cases have shown that the AUV reached and converged to the desired path.

AB Vehicle detection and vehicle viewpoint estimation are both crucial for assistive and autonomous driving systems. In this paper, we propose a soft discriminative mixture of viewpoint (SDMoV) models for joint vehicle detection and vehicle viewpoint estimation. The proposed SDMoV model is learned in two steps. First, a discriminative viewpoint-specific component model, which aims to maximize vehicle viewpoint classification accuracy, is learned for each cluster of vehicle images with similar viewpoint. Second, a new soft margin objective function, which aims to maximize vehicle detection accuracy, is designed to retrain these component models into a mixture of viewpoint models. The proposed SDMoV model is capable of detecting vehicles and estimating their viewpoints simultaneously. Experiments on three state-of-the-art datasets show that the proposed SDMoV model achieves superior accuracy for both vehicle detection and vehicle viewpoint estimation tasks.

AB This paper focuses on the control strategy needed by marine robots to be able to follow moving paths within a cooperative framework. This control aspect is essential in order to effectively perform emergency ship towing operations. In particular, these robots coordinate their motion, with the aim of performing an autonomous tying operation, linking the messenger line of a distressed ship to a salvage tugboat. Automatic guidance algorithms are developed in order to provide cooperation and coordination of robots' motion, in such a way to perform the knotting maneuver between the two employed vehicles. In particular, the major contribution of the present work in terms of adaptive control methodology consists in extending a well-known path following strategy for multi-vehicle cooperation to cope with moving reference paths. Extensive experimental testing validates the proposed concept, also pointing out the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed system in real-case scenarios.

The main feature of the proposed flight control system is that it consists of a single non-linear adaptive control law covering the entire flight envelope and does not require accurate knowledge of the aerodynamic coefficients, which are estimated on-line. The design follows a recently developed adaptive control framework that is based on the notion of invariant manifold and provides a modular controller estimator structure that is relatively easy to tune. The proposed scheme is tested via simulations on two different models of unmanned aerial vehicles: the XRAE-140 and the Eclipse flight demonstrator.

AB Intelligent and safe overtaking maneuvering is always a challenging task for autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes and experimentally implements a novel approach of overtaking maneuvering using modified form of Rendezvous Guidance (RG) algorithm for trajectory planning and obstacle avoidance, considering driver safety and comfort during autonomous overtaking. The simulations for all possible scenarios are conducted to ensure the effectiveness of proposed modified RG algorithm. These scenarios involved presence and absence of obstacle vehicle in overtaking lane alongside leading vehicle in driving lane. In addition, the enhanced performance of modified RG algorithm is established over conventional RG algorithm by comparative analysis. The results indicate that overtaking maneuvering period could be decreased by 10% using a modified RG algorithm and vehicle will cover less distance to complete overtaking. The efficacy of proposed method is justified by performing experiments using mobile robots. The experimental results and simulation results of modified RG algorithm are compared, and their plots are almost identical.

AB Environmental studies that use small Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) can survey wider and deeper areas, compared to traditional methods, at a reasonable cost. Thanks to the precise vehicle navigation systems, the data collected can be accurately geolocalized. Besides, lightweight vehicles can be deployed from the shore or from small boats and programmed by means of user-friendly graphical interfaces, thus reducing and simplifying the need of human resources and infrastructures. Based on such a technology, this paper presents a framework to assess the environmental impact of a marine sewage outfall set in the Bay of Palma (Mallorca, Spain). We report the results of the analysis of the images recorded in the course of six missions conducted with an AUV. The plan was designed after a microbiological analysis detected the presence of cyanobacterla in a sample of sand and water collected by scuba divers close to the sewer pipe mouth.

AB The recent advances in vehicular communications and networking are bringing self-driving vehicles closer to reality. Once full automation (i.e., levels 4 and 5 as defined in the five levels of autonomous driving) becomes a reality, entertainment services for both drivers and passengers will shift from listening to radios (or music) to watching videos. Hence, how to improve the quality of experience (QoE) for autonomous vehicle (AV) users, and to reduce the network load will become a crucial problem. Information-centric networking (ICN) is seen as one of the potential paradigms for next-generation networks, and could potentially be used for content distribution in vehicular networks. Caching, an important feature in ICN-based networks, is an efficient way to reduce network load, and to improve QoE for users. However, traditional reactive caching approaches are inefficient for AV users due to the high delay caused by their high speed. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical proactive caching approach that considers both users' future demands and AV user mobility. The proposed approach uses the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) technique to predict user's preferences which are then used to predict users' future demands by considering the historical popularity of videos. A user mobility prediction model is used to predict the AV users' next location based on the current location and the planned route information which can be retrieved from the self-driving system. Based on the predicted users' future demands and locations of AVs, the proposed caching approach can proactively cache videos that are likely to get requested at the next base station (BS) or roadside unit (RSU) that the users are moving to. The proposed approach has been evaluated under two scenarios: a highway scenario and a grid street scenario. Results show that the proposed approach can significantly improve the efficiency of caching in terms of hit ratio and the average number of hops.

AB This article presents the testing of distributed trajectory planning algorithms using our rapid prototyping platform, the Cyber-Physical Mobility Lab (CPM Lab). We propose two algorithms for distributed trajectory planning which plan trajectories at intersections, highway on- and off-ramps, and lane changes for networked and autonomous vehicles. The algorithms avoid collisions between vehicles using a synchronization-based and a prioritized Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) strategy. We test two algorithms in the CPM Lab which is able to handle parallel, sequential, and hybrid computations. The CPM Lab achieves reproducible experiments under non-deterministic computation times and stochastic communication times. Our evaluation shows that different algorithms for distributed trajectory planning can be efficiently tested in different in-the-loop tests.

AB To realise a safe trajectory planning and control performance based on model predictive control (MPC) and investigate the effects of MPC horizons on the system performance, this paper proposes a longitudinal-lateral decoupled trajectory planning method with a safety guarantee principle and develops an MPC tracking controller using the vehicle dynamics model. Besides, the effects of the planning horizon and the control horizon on lane-changing performance are investigated. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation indicator considering safety, comfort, and efficiency is proposed to provide recommended prediction horizons for different styles of driving behaviour. Several cases are studied and the results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB This study seeks to develop a cooperative platoon control for a platoon mixed with connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human-drive vehicles (HDVs), aiming to ensure system level traffic flow smoothness and stability as well as individual vehicles' mobility and safety. Specifically, our study integrated/contributed the following technical approaches. First, the car-following behavior of human-drive vehicles is modeled by well accepted Newell car-following models. Accordingly, an online curve matching algorithm is integrated to anticipate the aggregated response delay of the human-drive vehicles using real-time trajectory data. Built upon that, constrained One- or P-step MPC models are developed to control the movement of the CAV platoon upstream or downstream of the HDV platoon so that we can ensure both transient traffic smoothness and asymptotic stability of this sample mixed flow platoon, leveraging the communication and computation technologies equipped on CAVs. Considering the lack of the centralized computation facilities and severe changes of the platoon topology, this study develops a distributed algorithm to solve the MPCs according to the properties of the optimizers, such as solution uniqueness, sequentially feasibility, and nonempty interior point of the solution space. The convergence of the distributed algorithm as well as the stability of the MPC control is proved by both the theoretical analysis and the experimental study. Extensive numerical experiments based on the field data indicate that the distributed algorithm can solve the One-step and P-step MPCs efficiently. The cooperative MPC can dampen traffic oscillation propagation and stabilize the traffic flow more efficiently for the entire mixed flow platoon. Moreover, the cooperative platoon control scheme outperforms the other three control strategies, including the non-cooperative control strategy and a latest CACC strategy in literature.

AB Intersections are high-risk locations for autonomous vehicles (AVs). Crash causation analysis based on pre-crash scenarios can provide new insight into these crashes that can lead to effective countermeasures, but there are significant differences in pre-crash scenarios between autonomous and conventional vehicles, and inadequate AV data has put limits on research. The association rule method, however, can yield useful results despite these limits. This study therefore aims to use the method with pre-crash scenarios to understand the characteristics and contributing factors of AV crashes at intersections from the latest 5-year AV crash data. Analysis of 197 AV crashes at intersections revealed 30 types of pre-crash scenarios. The rear-end crash (58.88%) and lane change crash (16.24%) were the most frequently occurring scenarios for AVs. The proportion of AVs being rear-ended by conventional vehicles was 58.38%. The main contributing factors of these two most common AV scenarios were identified by association rules and crash causes were analyzed from the perspective of AV decision-making. The main factors contributing to the AV rear-end scenario were location outside the intersection in the intersection -related area, traffic signal control, autonomous engaged mode, mixed-use or public land, and weekdays, while those for lane change scenarios were on-street parking and the time of 8:00 a.m. Important causes of rear-end crashes attributable to the AV were inadequate stop and deceleration decisions by the AV's automated driving system (ADS) and insufficient collision avoidance decisions in lane change crashes. Identification of the pre-crash characteristics and contributing factors provide new insight into AV crash causation and can be used in the determination of the AV's operational design domain and the development and optimization of the AV's ADS at intersections. These findings can also play a role in guiding traffic safety agencies to discover AV hotspots and propose AV management regulations.

AB In the present work, sedimentary microbial fuel cells (s-MFC) have been proposed as effective tools to power remote sensors in different aquatic environments, thanks to their ability to produce renewable and sustainable energy continuously and autonomously. The present work proposes the optimization of cylindrical sedimentary microbial fuel cells (s-MFC) as a compact and cost-effective system suitable to be integrated as a payload in an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). To this purpose, a new AUV payload, named MFC-payload, is designed to host the cylindrical s-MFC and a data acquisition system to collect and store information on the voltage produced by the cell. Its overall performance was evaluated during two field measurement campaigns carried out in the Mediterranean Sea. This investigation demonstrates the power production by s-MFC during operation of the AUV in seawater and analyzes the actual influence of environmental conditions on the output power. This study demonstrates that energy production by s-MFCs integrated in AUV systems is decoupled by the navigation of the autonomous vehicle itself, showing the effectiveness of the application of MFC-based technology as a power payload for environmental analysis. All these latter results demonstrate and confirm the ability of the devices to continuously produce electricity during different AUV operation modes (i.e., depth and speed), while changing environmental conditions (i.e., pressure, temperature and oxygen content) demonstrate that cylindrical s-MFC devices are robust system that can be successfully used in underwater applications.

AB Inappropriate lane following and changing behaviors of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can result in accidents, such as rear-end collision and side collision. To remedy that, the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for autonomous driving decisions is currently a widely used promising solution. In this case, the accuracy and effectiveness of such a machine learning (ML) model is quite essential for this artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled CAVs. This article proposes a blockchain-based collective learning (BCL) framework for autonomous lane-changing systems. Four key issues, namely, learning efficiency, data security, users' privacy, as well as communication burden, are addressed by applying collective learning, vehicular blockchain, and knowledge transfer. First, we model the lane-changing problem as a DRL process and learn the autonomous lane-changing strategy through the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Second, a single CAV involves a limited number of driving scenarios, and the independent learning method has the problem of inefficiency. Therefore, we propose a collective learning framework to utilize the "collective intelligence" shared by CAVs. Third, a vehicular blockchain is then applied to ensure the security and privacy of the user and data. In addition, the introduction of the blockchain can incentivize more users to participate in collective learning. Finally, in order to accelerate the learning process and achieve higher level performance while further reducing the communication burden, we use the corresponding knowledge extracted from the ML model such as human learning, as privileged information for sharing instead of directly sharing local ML models. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal in terms of learning efficiency, driving safety, as well as system security and robustness.

AB The full-fledged development and the practical use of autonomous vehicles (AVs) would be a great technological achievement and would substantially reduce the enormous damages caused by driving accidents to life and property. Technology based companies such as Google and Audi are getting closer to realizing the dream of seeing fully AVs on the road. A vehicle's severely nonlinear dynamics due to the forces acting between road and vehicle tires, the coupling characteristic, and the uncertainties of parameters such as wheel moment of inertia and vehicle mass have made it rather difficult to approximate a precise mathematical model of vehicle dynamics. In this paper, to overcome these challenges we propose a model-independent control method based on improved adaptive neural controllers for path tracking control of AVs. In the structure of these improved neural controllers, we employ interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FS) as activation functions. Despite the interdependence of a vehicle's longitudinal and lateral motions, many of the research works on the path tracking of AVs have only focused on lateral motion control. By using the inputs of steering angle and torque, the presented control scheme tackles the simultaneous control of lateral and longitudinal moves. Results obtained from the lateral controller based on an improved neural network (NN) have been analyzed first at a constant velocity of 20 m/s and with/without considering parametric uncertainties. Then the longitudinal controller based on the improved NN is compared with sliding mode and common NN based controllers. Finally, the results obtained by simulating the simultaneous control of lateral and longitudinal motions indicate maximum tracking errors of 0.04 m (for lateral path following) and 0.02 m/s (for longitudinal velocity) and demonstrate the desirable performance of the proposed control approach.

TI Vision-Based Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Navigation in Poor Visibility
   Conditions Using a Model-Free Robust Control
SO JOURNAL OF SENSORS
LA English
DT Article
ID LOCALIZATION; IMAGES; AUVS
AB This paper presents a vision-based navigation system for an autonomous underwater vehicle in semistructured environments with poor visibility. In terrestrial and aerial applications, the use of visual systems mounted in robotic platforms as a control sensor feedback is commonplace. However, robotic vision-based tasks for underwater applications are still not widely considered as the images captured in this type of environments tend to be blurred and/or color depleted. To tackle this problem, we have adapted the l alpha beta color space to identify features of interest in underwater images even in extreme visibility conditions. To guarantee the stability of the vehicle at all times, a model-free robust control is used. We have validated the performance of our visual navigation system in real environments showing the feasibility of our approach.

AB This work describes a color Vision-based System intended to perform stable autonomous driving on unmarked roads. Accordingly, this implies the development of an accurate road surface detection system that ensures vehicle stability. Although this topic has already been documented in the technical literature by different research groups, the vast majority of the already existing Intelligent Transportation Systems are devoted to assisted driving of vehicles on marked extra urban roads and highways. The complete system was tested on the BABIECA prototype vehicle, which was autonomously driven for hundred of kilometers accomplishing different navigation missions on a private circuit that emulates an urban quarter. During the tests, the navigation system demonstrated its robustness with regard to shadows, road texture, and weather and changing illumination conditions.

AB Without an effective vaccine, treatment, or therapy, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading like fire and claiming lives. Countries began to adopt various strategies such as lockdown, mass testing, tracing, quarantine, sanitization, isolation, and treatment to contain COVID-19. However, it was soon realized that we need to take the help of powerful technologies to combat the spread of deadly COVID-19 until a vaccine or a drug is discovered. In this article, we discuss how the use of cutting edge technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Big data, artificial intelligence (AI), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)/drones, blockchain, robotics, autonomous ground vehicles, communication technologies in screening, testing, contact tracing, spread analysis, sanitization, and protocol enforcements can help prevent the COVID-19 spread.

AB In this paper, a review of the literature on vehicle suspension control with an emphasis on learning based algorithms is presented. An elaborated discussion on the potentials of learning based controllers is also given. Some of the most well-known active and semi-active suspension controllers are elicited from the literature, and their pros and cons are reported. By categorizing the existing suspension control techniques and considering their functionalities, it is tried to make a ground for indicating the high potential of learning strategies for this task. In this context, several advantageous features of statistical learning and computational intelligence methods are enumerated, which can play a key role in the future of vehicle suspension control. In the authors' view, the necessity of considering learning strategies for suspension control lies in the fact that, over the past two decades, tremendous effort has been exerted on developing smart and autonomous vehicles to reduce the need for human-machine interaction. Given the fact that the final goal of automotive industrialists is to design efficient and safe autonomous vehicles, it is impossible to neglect the pivotal role of probabilistic artificial intelligence and statistical learning algorithms. In short, by reading this review paper, one can find out (1) the state-of-the-art of the conducted researches on suspension controllers, (2) the potential of learning strategies and their applicability to vehicle suspension control, and (3) the important open questions which deserve further investigation to come up with robust, stable and accurate learnable controllers. The outcome of this paper can be of use for practitioners working on designing smart and autonomous vehicles. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Due to the increase in importance of factory-automation (FA) in the field of production, the importance of the autonomous guided vehicle's (AGV) role has also increased. This paper is about an active and effective controller that can flexibly prepare for changeable circumstances. For this study, research into a behaviour-based system evolving by itself is also being considered. In this paper an active and effective AGV fuzzy controller is constructed to carry out self-organization. To construct it, the authors have tuned suboptimally the membership function using a genetic algorithm (GA) and improved the control efficiency by self-correction and the generation of control rules.

AB Fully automated vehicles deployed with high computational/perceptive capabilities will soon become a reality. Such capabilities enable the cooperation among vehicles and the realization of interacting autonomous driving systems. Edge computing has emerged to provide a plethora of computational services to reduce network latency. Applications at the edge that apply analytics on the sensory data are therefore indispensable for self-driving vehicles. We consider in this paper a network that interconnects vehicles to an edge server at a roadside unit. Each vehicle extracts multiple information by sampling multiple processes and sends them to the corresponding edge application. To make timely decisions, ``fresh'' information needs to be offloaded, processed, and delivered back to vehicles; in this context, we adopt a new metric called Age of Information (AoI) that has been lately used to measure the freshness of information. We seek to jointly schedule vehicles' transmission of information and schedule information processing at the edge to minimize the AoI of all processes. We mathematically formulate the problem and prove its NP-Hardness. To overcome this hardness, we propose a logic-based Benders decomposition to divide the problem into a master and several subproblems. Then, we present an exact polynomial-time solution for the subproblems, a scalable heuristic for the master, and devise a valid yet efficient Benders cut. We implement the system simulation on the well-known traffic simulator SUMO and compare the decomposition with CPLEX branch-and-cut; Although the problem is highly intricate, our method finds a near-optimal solution (maximum deviation is 7% from optimal solution) with a speedup that reaches 95%. We study the system performance by varying different system parameters.

AB Autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) are revolutionizing the world of smart city transportation due to their low-resource consumption, improved traffic efficiency, zero carbon emissions, and improved road safety. To ensure the safe passage of vehicles through a complex environment, it is essential to plan for safe and smart navigation and energy management for AEVs. This demands an effective model for locating the optimal electric charging stations (ECSs) for scheduling and recharging the AEVs when they run on low battery. Many research works, however, do not focus on navigation and scheduling policies for AEV charging that would occur in extreme events in complex environments. This article puts forth a collaborative optimal navigation and charge planning (CONCP) framework based on multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL). To ensure the safe passage of vehicles through the complex environment, it is essential to plan for safe and smart navigation and energy management for AEVs. The CONCP framework aims to achieve the best route from the origin to the final destination for each AEV, scheduling the optimal ECS while avoiding obstacles, reducing traffic congestion, and maximizing energy efficiency, accordingly. The experimental results indicate that CONCP achieves 27% higher success rates, 31% fewer collision rates, and 37% higher reward per episode than the other state-of-the-art algorithms.

However, their introduction is associated with a number of enduring Human Factors challenges (e.g. difficulties monitoring automated systems) for human operators, with their 'remoteness' in shore-side control centres exacerbating issues. This paper aims to investigate underlying decision-making processes of operators of uncrewed vehicles using the theoretical foundation of the Perceptual Cycle Model (PCM). A case study of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) accident has been chosen as it bears similarities to the operation of MASS through means of a ground-based control centre. Two PCMs were developed; one to demonstrate what actually happened and one to demonstrate what should have happened. Comparing the models demonstrates the importance of operator situational awareness, clearly defined operator roles, training and interface design in making decisions when operating from remote control centres. Practitioner Summary: To investigate underlying decision-making processes of operators of uncrewed vehicles using the Perceptual Cycle Model, by using an UAV accident case study. The findings showed the importance of operator situational awareness, clearly defined operator roles, training and interface design in making decisions when monitoring uncrewed systems from remote control centres.

AB In this paper, we propose a Geometric Model-Free Approach with a Particle Filter (GMFA-PF) through the use of automotive LiDAR for real-time tracking of moving objects within an urban driving environment. GMFA-PF proved to be lightweight, capable of finishing the process within the sensing period of the LiDAR on a single CPU. The proposed GMFA-PF tracks and estimates moving objects without any assumptions on the geometry of the target. This approach enables efficient tracking of multiple object classes, with robustness to a sparse point cloud. Point cloud on moving objects is classified via the predicted Static Obstacle Map (STOM). A likelihood field is generated through the classified point cloud and is used in particle filtering to estimate the moving object's pose, shape, and speed. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons - with Geometric Model-Based Tracking (MBT), Deep Neural Network (DNN), and GMFA - are performed for GMFA-PF using urban driving and scenario driving data gathered on an autonomous vehicle fitted with close-to-market sensors. The proposed approach shows robust tracking and accurate estimation performance in both sparse and dense point clouds; GMFA-PF achieves improved tracking performance in dense traffic and reduces yaw estimation delay compared to the others. Autonomous vehicles with GMFA-PF demonstrated auto-nomous driving on urban roads.

AB A novel design of a three dimensional localiser intended for autonomous robot vehicles is presented.  A prototype is implemented in air using ultrasonic beacons at known positions, and can be adapted to underwater environments where it has important applications, such as deep sea maintenance, data collection and reconnaissance tasks.  The paper presents the hardware design, algorithms for position and orientation determination (six degrees of freedom), and performance results of a laboratory prototype.  Two appraoches are discussed for position and orientation determination - (i) fast single measurement set techniques and (ii) computationally slower Kalman filter based techniques.  The Kalman filter approach allows the incorporation of robot motion information, more accurate beacon modelling and the capability of processing data from more than four beacons, the minimum number required for localisation.

DE VANETs; autonomous vehicles; LIDAR; manifold alignment; KITTI
AB In the past two years, calls for developing synergistic links between the two worlds of vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) and autonomous vehicles have significantly gone up to achieve further onroad safety and benefts for end-users. In this paper, we present our vision to create such a beneficial link by designing a multimodal scheme for object detection, recognition, and mapping based on the fusion of stereo camera frames, point cloud Velodyne LIDAR scans, and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) basic safety messages (BSMs) exchanges using VANET protocols. Exploiting the high similarities in the underlying manifold properties of the three data sets, and their high neighborhood correlation, the proposed scheme employs semi-supervised manifold alignment to merge the key features of rich texture descriptions of objects from 2-D images, depth and distance between objects provided by 3-D point cloud, and the awareness of self-declared vehicles from BSMs' 3-D information including the ones not seen by camera and LIDAR. The proposed scheme is applied to create joint pixel-to-point-cloud and pixel-to-V2V correspondences of objects in frames from the KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite, using a semi-supervised manifold alignment, to achieve camera-LIDAR and camera-V2V mapping of their recognized objects. We present the alignment accuracy results over two different driving sequences and show the additional acquired knowledge of objects from the various input modalities. We also study the effect of the number of neighbors employed in the alignment process on the alignment accuracy. With proper choice of parameters, the testing of our proposed scheme over two entire driving sequences exhibits 100% accuracy in the majority of cases, 74% - 92% and 50% - 72% average alignment accuracy for vehicles and pedestrians and up to 150% additional object recognition of the testing vehicle's surrounding.

ID MODEL
AB Planning for autonomous vehicles to merge into high-density traffic flows within limited mileage is quite challenging. Specifically, the driving trajectory will inevitably have intersections with other vehicles whose driving intentions can't be directly observed. Herein, a two-stage algorithm framework that is decomposed into the longitudinal and lateral planning processes for online merging planning is proposed. An improved particle filter is used to estimate the driving models of surrounding vehicles for predicting their future driving intentions. Based on Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), different action spaces are evaluated for longitudinal merging gap selection and lateral interactive merging operation, while heuristic pruning is used to reduce the computation cost. Moreover, the coefficients related to the driving styles are introduced, and their influences on merging performance are analyzed. Finally, the proposed algorithm is implemented in a two-lane simulation environment. The results show that the proposal has outperformed other baseline methods.

AB The most frequent cause of vehicle accidents (car, bike, truck, etc.) is the unexpected existence of barriers while driving. An automated braking system will assist and minimize such collisions and save the driver and other people's lives and have a substantial influence on driver safety and comfort. An autonomous braking system is a complicated mechatronic system that incorporates a front-mounted ultrasonic wave emitter capable of creating and transmitting ultrasonic waves. In addition, a front-mounted ultrasonic receiver is attached to gather ultrasonic wave signals that are reflected. The distance between the impediment and the vehicle is determined by the reflected wave. Then, a microprocessor is utilized to control the vehicle's speed depending on the detected pulse information, which pushes the brake pedal and applies the vehicle's brakes extremely hard for safety. For work-energy at surprise condition for velocity 20 km/hr, the braking distance is 17.69 m, and for velocity 50 km/hr, the braking distance is 73.14.

AB A major issue required to enhance the autonomy level of unmanned vehicles is real-time motion planning. In this context, optimal trajectories need to be generated online considering the vehicle's dynamic potentials and constraints. However, autonomous air vehicles often need to plan and execute their missions with varying objectives that may even be dictated in flight. Therefore, the current study introduces and focuses on the new concept of variable-objective motion planning. In this regard, a new dynamic multi-objective heuristic optimization algorithm is developed for path and motion planning of autonomous air vehicles in presence of deterministic terrain obstacles as well as random threats. Effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated via several simulated scenarios and verified against past research. The results are promising and indicative of a good potential of the proposed algorithm in producing optimal real-time optimal feasible trajectories with multi-variable objectives.

AB This paper presents a new solution for underwater observation, image recording, mapping and 3D reconstruction in shallow waters. The platform, designed as a research and testing tool, is based on a small underwater robot equipped with a MEMS-based IMU, two stereo cameras and a pressure sensor. The data given by the sensors are fused, adjusted and corrected in a multiplicative error state Kalman filter (MESKF), which returns a single vector with the pose and twist of the vehicle and the biases of the inertial sensors (the accelerometer and the gyroscope). The inclusion of these biases in the state vector permits their self-calibration and stabilization, improving the estimates of the robot orientation. Experiments in controlled underwater scenarios and in the sea have demonstrated a satisfactory performance and the capacity of the vehicle to operate in real environments and in real time.

AB In this paper. two adaptive proportional-derivative (PD) control laws are proposed for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The proposed adaptive controllers require only model of gravity and buoyancy regressor matrix and do not need any knowledge of inertia matrix, Coriolis and centripetal force. hydrodynamic damping, and the parameters of the gravity and buoyancy force. Hence, the proposed controllers have the advantages of simplicity and ease of implementation. We shall also prove that the setpoint controller is a special case of the region reaching controller when a desired region is reduced to a point. Furthermore, the inverse Jacobian matrix is not required in the control laws. Lyapunov-like functions are proposed for the stability analysis. Simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.

AB PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to improve autonomous flight performance of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) having actively sweep angle morphing wing using simultaneous UAV and flight control system (FCS) design. Design/methodology/approachAn UAV is remanufactured in the ISTE Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Laboratory. Its wing sweep angle can vary actively during flight. FCS parameters and wing sweep angle are simultaneously designed to optimize autonomous flight performance index using a stochastic optimization method called as simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA). Results obtained are applied for flight simulations. FindingsUsing simultaneous design process of an UAV having actively sweep angle morphing wing and FCS design, autonomous flight performance index is maximized. Research limitations/implicationsAuthorization of Directorate General of Civil Aviation in Turkey is crucial for real-time UAV flights. Practical implicationsSimultaneous UAV having actively sweep angle morphing wing and FCS design process is so beneficial for recovering UAV autonomous flight performance index. Social implicationsSimultaneous UAV having actively sweep angle morphing wing and FCS design process achieves confidence, high autonomous performance index and simple service demands of UAV operators. Originality/valueComposing a novel approach to improve autonomous flight performance index (e.g. less settling and rise time, less overshoot meanwhile trajectory tracking) of an UAV and creating an original procedure carrying out simultaneous UAV having actively sweep angle morphing wing and FCS design idea.

AB This paper presents a robust bounded controller that prevents an autonomous 4WS4WD vehicle from wheel skidding in presence of uncertainties of both tire/road condition and aerodynamic drag. For eliminating the steady-state error of path tracking, this control scheme incorporates integral compensation into a robust low-and high-gain technique, which in our earlier work has been introduced to achieve the anti-skidding. In comparison, this new proposed scheme ensures the path-tracking error can vanish asymptotically without incurring high-frequency chattering in the control signals. Simulation shows that, under the uncertainty effects, the proposed controller effectively limits the combined wheel slip and achieves the asymptotic path tracking. Moreover, the control inputs of wheel torque and wheel steering are coordinated well in response to this new control scheme.

DT Article
ID INSURANCE
AB This article proposes a scheme of liability that would desirably control accident risks in the coming world in which motor vehicles will be predominantly autonomous. In that world, the typical traveler will not be an active driver, which will render liability premised on driver fault largely irrelevant as a means of reducing vehicle accident dangers. Moreover, no other conventional principle of individual or of manufacturer liability would serve well to do so. Indeed, strict manufacturer liability, recommended by many commentators, would tend to leave accident risks unchanged from their levels in the absence of any liability. However, a new form of strict liability-the hallmark of which is that damages would be paid to the state-would be superior to conventional rules of liability in alleviating accident risks and would be easy to implement.

AB We examine the use of quadratic programming (QP)-based control allocation for ground vehicles with multiple inputs. This control problem is relevant for safety systems, such as stability control and driver assistance technologies, and autonomous vehicle control. The control objective is to track a desired yaw rate trajectory while minimising vehicle side slip. The proposed QP-based control allocation law is simulated in a closed loop with a non-linear vehicle. Vehicle attitude commands are generated by a linear quadratic regulator whose gains are designed around a linear vehicle model to arrive at a combination of vehicle commands. The closed loop system is tested on three simulated vehicle models each possessing different input capabilities. The simulation tests include both nominal and failure scenarios of operation.

   learning-based semantic segmentation; graph SLAM; autonomous vehicle
AB LiDAR-based Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM), which provides environmental information for autonomous vehicles by map building, is a major challenge for autonomous driving. In addition, the semantic information has been used for the LiDAR-based SLAM with the advent of deep neural network-based semantic segmentation algorithms. The semantic segmented point clouds provide a much greater range of functionality for autonomous vehicles than geometry alone, which can play an important role in the mapping step. However, due to the uncertainty of the semantic segmentation algorithms, the semantic segmented point clouds have limitations in being directly used for SLAM. In order to solve the limitations, this paper proposes a semantic segmentation-based LiDAR SLAM system considering the uncertainty of the semantic segmentation algorithms. The uncertainty is explicitly modeled by proposed probability models which are come from the data-driven approaches. Based on the probability models, this paper proposes semantic registration which calculates the transformation relationship of consecutive point clouds using semantic information with proposed probability models. Furthermore, the proposed probability models are used to determine the semantic class of the points when the multiple scans indicate different classes due to the uncertainty. The proposed framework is verified and evaluated by the KITTI dataset and outdoor environments. The experiment results show that the proposed semantic mapping framework reduces the errors of the mapping poses and eliminates the ambiguity of the semantic information of the generated semantic map.

AB This paper proposes the study of a robust control scheme for an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) in a urban waterway using Visual Odometry (VO) for position estimation of the vehicle instead of traditional sensors. For different applications, a USV is required to operate in autonomous navigation mode and under various disturbances inherent to its environment as currents and waves. To achieve efficient operation, a robust control scheme is required to cope with such disturbances. The autonomous navigation is achieved by using VO to estimate the vehicle's position for denied Global Positioning Systems (GPS) environments. A robust control scheme based on Sliding Modes (SM) control theory is designed and its convergence is guaranteed by means of Lyapunov analysis. The tracking capabilities under disturbance conditions using VO for position estimation are verified in simulation using the virtual world tool from Matlab and Simulink.

AB Ethics settings allow for morally significant decisions made by humans to be programmed into autonomous machines, such as autonomous vehicles or autonomous weapons. Customizable ethics settings are a type of ethics setting in which the users of autonomous machines make such decisions. Here two arguments are provided in defence of customizable ethics settings. Firstly, by approaching ethics settings in the context of failure management, it is argued that customizable ethics settings are instrumentally and inherently valuable for building resilience into the larger socio-technical systems in which autonomous machines operate. Secondly, after defining the preliminary condition of responsibility attribution and demonstrating how ethics settings enable humans to exert control over the outcomes of morally significant incidents, it is shown that ethics settings narrow the responsibility gap.

AB Inspired by connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technologies, extensive studies have developed open-loop vehicle-level trajectory planning or speed advisory to promote eco-driving at traffic intersections. But few studies work on platoon-level closed-loop trajectory control, which can better sustain stream traffic smoothness and efficiency. Motivated by this research gap, this study developed a system optimal platoon-centered control for eco-driving (PCC-eDriving), which can guide a platoon mixed with connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and humandriven vehicles (HDVs) to smoothly approach, split as needed, and then sequentially pass signalized intersections, while reducing or even avoiding sharp deceleration and red idling. The effort is separated to Part I and Part II to prevent a lengthy article. Specifically, Part I of this study modeled the PCC-eDriving as a hybrid Model Predictive Control (MPC) system. It involves three MPC controllers for platoon trajectory control and a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) for optimal splitting decisions. Each MPC controller is integrated with robust vehicle dynamics and an online adaptive curve learning algorithm to factor control and vehicle driving uncertainties. An active-set-based optimal condition decomposition algorithm (AS-OCD) was developed to efficiently solve the MPC controllers' large-scale optimizers in a distributed manner. The numerical experiments built upon the field and simulated data indicated that the PCCeDriving could significantly improve traffic smoothness and efficiency while reducing energy consumption and emission at urban signalized intersections. Part II will analyze and prove the sequential feasibility and the Input-to-State stability of the hybrid MPC system, as well as the convergence of the AS-OCD solution approach to theoretically sustain the performance of the hybrid MPC system.

AB Insufficiency of dynamic range of conventional video cameras is an important problem in realizing a robust vision system for autonomous vehicles because road scenes have a very wide dynamic range of brightness. To solve the problem, a method for expanding the dynamic range of video cameras by combining the images taken under different exposure conditions has been developed. Using this method, an experimental vision sensor with a wide dynamic range has been manufactured. The developed sensor has a dynamic range of 10000, which is approximately 30 times as wide as that of a conventional video camera. The effectiveness of the developed vision sensor in comparison with a conventional video camera was confirmed from the experiments on a highway under various lighting conditions.

The objective of this article is to provide a structured review of simulations and practical implementations of collision-avoidance and path-planning algorithms in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The novelty of the review paper is to consider not only the results of numerical research but also the newest results of verifying collision-avoidance and path-planning algorithms in real applications together with a comparison of the difficulties encountered during simulations and their practical implementation. Analysing the last 20 years of AUV development, it can be seen that experiments in a real environment are dominated by classical methods. In the case of simulation studies, artificial intelligence (AI) methods are used as often as classical methods. In simulation studies, the APF approach is most often used among classical methods, whereas among AI algorithms reinforcement learning and fuzzy logic methods are used. For real applications, the most used approach is reactive behaviors, and AI algorithms are rarely used in real implementations. Finally, this article provides a general summary, future works, and a discussion of the limitations that inhibit the further development in this field.

AB An autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) is a small autonomous boat that is expected to be used for automated investigations in radiation-contaminated areas or for unattended fishing, which will help the fishing industry, whose workforce is significantly decreasing. However, the discussion on the modeling and control of an ASV has mainly been based on those of a conventional ship. We have developed a micro-ASV (mu-ASV) on the basis of the concept that an ASV is a mobile robot. The translational motion of the mu-ASV is controlled by main thrusters, but its rotation is controlled by a bow thruster, not by a rudder as in an ordinary ship. Using the robot operating system (ROS), we demonstrated that the models of translational and rotational motions can be easily identified by adopting a distributed design using sliding mode control, in which the motion of the mu-ASV is controlled by main and bow thrusters. We also demonstrated that the translational and angular motions can be controlled by a simple dynamic positioning system (DPS). These findings allowed us to make the equations of motion and the control design of the mu-ASV simpler than those of an ordinary ship. A manual operation test using a joystick was conducted in the open sea. Promising results were achieved and are presented in this paper.

AB The increasing development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) influences the future of transportation. Beyond the potential benefits in terms of safety, efficiency, and comfort, also potential risks of novel driving technologies need to be addressed. In this article, we explore risk perceptions toward connected and autonomous driving in comparison to conventional driving. In order to gain a deeper understanding of individual risk perceptions, we adopted a two-step empirical procedure. First, focus groups (N=17) were carried out to identify relevant risk factors for autonomous and connected driving. Further, a questionnaire was developed, which was answered by 516 German participants. In the questionnaire, three driving technologies (connected, autonomous, conventional) were evaluated via semantic differential (rating scale to identify connotative meaning of technologies). Second, participants rated perceived risk levels (for data, traffic environment, vehicle, and passenger) and perceived benefits and barriers of connected/autonomous driving. Since previous experience with automated functions of driver assistance systems can have an impact on the evaluation, three experience groups have been formed. The effect of experience on benefits and barrier perceptions was also analyzed. Risk perceptions were significantly smaller for conventional driving compared to connected/autonomous driving. With increasing experience, risk perception decreases for novel driving technologies with one exception: the perceived risk in handling data is not influenced by experience. The findings contribute to an understanding of risk perception in autonomous driving, which helps to foster a successful implementation of AVs on the market and to develop public information strategies.

AB We consider a strongly coupled ODE-PDE system representing moving bottlenecks immersed in vehicular traffic. The systems can be used to represent the effect of autonomous vehicles immersed in the bulk traffic. The PDE consists of a scalar conservation law modeling the traffic flow evolution and the ODE models the trajectory of a slow moving vehicle. The moving bottleneck influences the bulk traffic flow via a point flux constraint, which is given by an inequality on the flux at the slow vehicle position. We prove uniqueness and continuous dependence of solutions with respect to initial data of bounded variation. The proof is based on a new backward in time method established to capture the values of the norm of generalized tangent vectors at every time. The results are the first step to study control problems for traffic flow via the action of autonomous vehicles.

TI Updating Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Risk Based on the Effectiveness
   of Failure Prevention and Correction
SO JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID RELIABILITY; OPERATIONS
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have proven to be feasible platforms for marine observations. Risk and reliability studies on the performance of these vehicles by different groups show a significant difference in reliability, with the observation that the outcomes depend on whether the vehicles are operated by developers or nondevelopers. This paper shows that this difference in reliability is due to the failure prevention and correction procedures-risk mitigation-put in place by developers. However, no formalization has been developed for updating the risk profile based on the expected effectiveness of the failure prevention and correction process. A generic Bayesian approach for updating the risk profile is presented, based on the probability of failure prevention and correction and the number of subsequent deployments on which the failure does not occur. The approach, which applies whether the risk profile is captured in a parametric or nonparametric survival model, is applied to a real case study of the International Submarine Engineering Ltd. (ISE) Explorer AUV.

AB Rear-end collision is one of the most serious accidents for vehicles, some rear end collision avoidance systems have been developed to protect vehicles from rear-end collisions. Current rear-end collision avoidance systems mainly utilize vehicle-relative measurement sensors to acquire information on surrounding vehicles, considering limited detection ranges and impaired performance in bad weathers of these vehicle sensors, currently used collision avoidance systems cannot guarantee vehicle safety in all environments. Vehicle-localization-based and intervehicle communication-based rear-end collision avoidance approaches can be possible solutions to improve vehicle safety compared with present vehicle sensor-based collision avoidance systems. Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) is introduced to transfer information on surrounding vehicles instead of using vehicle-relative measurement sensors. Vehicle dynamic model and brake system dynamics are used to generate precise vehicle states that would be used in rear-end collision avoidance. Required safe distance is used as the safety index when using different vehicle-localization methods with a predefined safety probability of 99.99%. Monte Carlo simulations are executed to evaluate the influence of measurement uncertainties. Simulation results show that vehicle-localization-based and DSRC-based rear-end collision avoidance methods can guarantee vehicles free from rear-end collision and expand the service capabilities of velocity compared with the traditional vehicle radar-based rear-end collision avoidance method. Evaluation outcomes encourage us to adopt a more precise absolute vehicle-localization approach in rear-end collision avoidance, because required safe distance and safe distance margin can be decreased when using a high-precision vehicle-localization method compared with standalone GNSS-based localization. Some further aspects are discussed in this work that need to be tackled with to make vehicle-localization-based and intervehicle communication-based rear-end collision avoidance systems into practice, including real-time brake system dynamics acquirement, benefit of DSRC to curve roads, and so on.

AB Vehicle trajectory prediction is a challenging problem in the field of autonomous driving, which is of great significance to the safety of autonomous driving and traffic roads. In view of the interaction between surrounding vehicles and target vehicle and its own trajectory, we propose a new graph network model to predict future vehicle trajectory. First, the correlation network of vehicles at each time is constructed based on the complex network method. In order to make up for the lack of real spatial relevance caused by the fixed graph, we propose an adaptive parameter matrix to coordinate and optimize the global spatio-temporal graph. Second, the global spatio-temporal features of vehicle historical trajectory data are extracted by stacked graph convolution module. Finally, the obtained graph features are coded based on seq2seq network, and the trajectory prediction of road vehicles at different times in the future is realized. Our model has been trained and verified on the published NGSIM US-101 and I-80 data sets. Compared with other advanced schemes, our model has more accurate results in the future time of 5 seconds. In predicting the future group trajectory of vehicles on the road, the accuracy of long-term prediction is 16.6% higher than that of the most advanced scheme.

AB Reliable vision-based control of an autonomous vehicle requires the ability to focus attention on the important features in an input scene. Previous work with an autonomous lane following system, ALVINN (Pomerleau, 1993), has yielded good results in uncluttered conditions. This paper presents an artificial neural network based learning approach for handling difficult scenes which will confuse the ALVINN system. This work presents a mechanism for achieving task-specific focus of attention by exploiting temporal coherence. A saliency map, which is based upon a computed expectation of the contents of the inputs in the next time step, indicates which regions of the input retina are important for performing the task. The saliency map can be used to accentuate the features which are important for the task, and de-emphasize those which are not.

AB This study provides a large-scale micro-simulation of transportation patterns in a metropolitan area when relying on a system of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). The six-county region of Austin, Texas is used for its land development patterns, demographics, networks, and trip tables. The agent-based MATSim toolkit allows modelers to track individual travelers and individual vehicles, with great temporal and spatial detail. MATSim's algorithms help improve individual travel plans (by changing tour and trip start times, destinations, modes, and routes). Here, the SAV mode requests were simulated through a stochastic process for four possible fare levels: $0.50, $0.75, $1, and $1.25 per trip-mile. These fares resulted in mode splits of 50.9, 12.9, 10.5, and 9.2% of the region's person-trips, respectively. Mode choice results show longer-distance travelers preferring SAVs to private, human-driven vehicles (HVs)-thanks to the reduced burden of SAV travel (since one does not have to drive the vehicle). For travelers whose households do not own an HV, SAVs (rather than transit, walking and biking) appear preferable for trips under 10 miles, which is the majority of those travelers' trip-making. It may be difficult for traditional transit services and operators to survive once SAVs become available in regions like Austin, where dedicated rail lines and bus lanes are few. Simulation of SAV fleet operations suggest that higher fare rates allow for greater vehicle replacement (ranging from 5.6 to 7.7 HVs per SAV, assuming that the average SAV serves 17-20 person-trips per day); when fares rise, travel demands shift away from longer trip distances. Empty vehicle miles traveled by the fleet of SAVs ranged from 7.8 to 14.2%, across the scenarios in this study. Implications of mobility and sustainability benefits of SAVs are also discussed in the paper.

DE Scene reconstruction; Autonomous driving; Texture mapping
ID DATA-DEPENDENT TRIANGULATIONS; LINEAR INTERPOLATION
AB Autonomous vehicles have a large number of on-board sensors, not only for providing coverage all around the vehicle, but also to ensure multi-modality in the observation of the scene. Because of this, it is not trivial to come up with a single, unique representation that feeds from the data given by all these sensors. We propose an algorithm which is capable of mapping texture collected from vision based sensors onto a geometric description of the scenario constructed from data provided by 3D sensors. The algorithm uses a constrained Delaunay triangulation to produce a mesh which is updated using a specially devised sequence of operations. These enforce a partial configuration of the mesh that avoids bad quality textures and ensures that there are no gaps in the texture. Results show that this algorithm is capable of producing fine quality textures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This issue is devoted to recent developments of autonomous and Lagrangian platforms and sensors (ALPS) and their uses for solving a broad range of interdisciplinary aquatic problems. The collective papers treat a variety of problems that generally require measurements spanning a continuum of temporal and spatial scales. ALPS platforms in this issue include surface drifters, profiling and other types of subsurface floats, gliders, unmanned boats, autonomous underwater vehicles, and instrumented animals. ALPS platforms can provide access in difficult environments (e. g., under ice and in high-sea states). They are also important for emerging networked ocean and lake observing systems that require continuous measurements and near-real-time data. This introductory paper provides historical perspectives, background, motivation for the issue, and a tabular summary of papers in the present collection.

AB The last decade witnessed a great development of automated driving vehicles (ADVs) and vehicle intelligence. The significant increment of machine intelligence poses a new challenge to the community, which is the collaboration between human drivers and vehicle autonomy. As vehicle autonomy is gaining more control authority, the roles that human drivers can play in the future need to be further clarified. In this study, literature review and perspectives on the human behaviors and cognition (HBC) for ADVs toward human-autonomy (H-A) collaboration are proposed. First, the H-A collaboration basics and key factors are reviewed. Then, the HBC issues in driver behavior modeling and understanding are discussed. Specifically, two key factors are reviewed, which are human trust and situation awareness (SA). Next, HBC in two H-A collaboration-enabled vehicle control methods, namely, shared control and take-over control, are analyzed. It is shown that the human-centered collaboration strategy that integrates driver states will largely increase the acceptance of the ADVs. Then, the HBC issues in the design of humanmachine-interface (HMI) for future autonomous and collaboration-enabled ADVs are discussed. Last, challenges and future works for H-A collaboration on ADVs are analyzed to contribute to the development of understandable, trustable, and acceptable ADVs.

AB The use of autonomous helicopters in civilian applications requires the improvement of safety conditions to avoid potential accidents. Fault detection and isolation (FDI) plays an important role in this context. This paper presents an actuator and sensor FDI system for small autonomous helicopters. Fault detection is accomplished by evaluating any significant change in the behaviour of the vehicle with respect to the fault-free behaviour, which is estimated by using observers. Several types of faults have been considered. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by means of experimental results and simulations. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly becoming popular due to their use in many commercial and military applications, and their affordability. The UAVs are equipped with various sensors, hardware platforms and software technologies which enable them to support the diverse application portfolio. Sensors include vision-based sensors such as RGB-D cameras, thermal cameras, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), mmWave radars, ultrasonic sensors, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) which enable UAVs for autonomous navigation, obstacle detection, collision avoidance, object tracking and aerial inspection. To enable smooth operation, UAVs utilize a number of communication technologies such as wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi), long range (LoRa), long-term evolution for machine-type communication (LTE-M), etc., along with various machine learning algorithms. However, each of these different technologies come with their own set of advantages and challenges. Hence, it is essential to have an overview of the different type of sensors, computing and communication modules and algorithms used for UAVs. This paper provides a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art embedded sensors, communication technologies, computing platforms and machine learning techniques used in autonomous UAVs. The key performance metrics along with operating principles and a detailed comparative study of the various technologies are also studied and presented. The information gathered in this paper aims to serve as a practical reference guide for designing smart sensing applications, low-latency and energy efficient communication strategies, power efficient computing modules and machine learning algorithms for autonomous UAVs. Finally, some of the open issues and challenges for future research and development are also discussed.

AB Advanced autonomous vehicle technology is suggested to offer a unique solution to many of the current problems in road transport. This paper studies the impact of the transition in automated driving capabilities (driving mode choice) on road congestion pricing and vice versa, accounting for the interdependencies between traffic flow, the choice level of autonomous driving, effective road capacity and marginal travel cost. It is shown that (in a more or less distant future) when drivers can choose among various levels of car automation during a trip and when shortcomings associated with autonomous driving - e.g. adverse effects regarding privacy, software hacking, liability, safety, driving pleasure, manual control recovery are - non-negligible, their generalized user cost curve is the lower envelope of a swarm of traffic flow dependent individual cost curves whose slope is determined by the level of autonomous driving. This has several implications for our understanding of Pigouvian road congestion pricing. Most importantly, marginal social trip costs are then no longer convex and strictly increasing in traffic flow even when traffic is only 'normally congested', thereby introducing the possibility of multiple congestion pricing equilibria even in the absence of what is usually called 'hypercongestion'. When inconveniences related to autonomous driving are sufficiently high, the imposition of congestion tolls may lead to a situation where drivers abandon autonomous technologies entirely and opt instead for fully manual driving. Our findings suggest that the emergence of advanced autonomous driving capabilities and the transition from manual to automated control on the road will probably make congestion pricing more, not less, complex for researchers and policymakers.

In a proposed framework based on the game theory, a bounded and closed region encircling the tracking vehicle is identified to enable persistent tracking and a tracking algorithm is constructed accordingly. The proposed approach is successfully verified through experiments using two ground vehicles, one serving as the autonomous tracking vehicle and the other as the target vehicle.

IoAT includes robotics, autonomous vehicles, drones, and smart home devices. Recent progress in deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) is the foundation for all IoAT applications. Using the systematic literature review (SLR) method, we examined five application domains for IoAT: healthcare, military and security, transportation, aerospace, and home robotics. Analysis shows that 30% of the IoAT application domains are devoted to transportation applications, 21% to military and security applications, 19% to aerospace applications, 16% to healthcare applications, and 14% to home robotics applications. Finally, we discuss the current issues and potential research challenges in the context of IoAT.

AB This work investigates and identifies a first principles maneuvering model for a small size robotic twin thruster autonomous surface vessel (ASV) that includes and explains the sources of nonlinearity and asymmetry of this class of robots. With respect to state of the art ASV models, the proposed one accounts for the effects generating a transverse thrust, explaining the asymmetric turning radii. The model also accounts for the need to adapt the hydrodynamic derivatives when the ASV performs large or tight turns. An experimental dataset has been acquired using the ULISSE ASV and it is used to support the proposed model in comparison to the "baseline"one often used in the literature. The improved precision of the proposed model in fitting experimental data is a necessary prerequisite to design model-based motion controller and navigation systems with enhanced performance.

AB We consider the problem of tracing the structure of oceanological features using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Solving this problem requires the construction of a control strategy that will determine the actions for the AUV based on the current state, as measured by on-board sensors and the historic trajectory (including sensed data) of the AUV. We approach this task by applying plan-based policy-learning, in which a large set of sampled problems are solved using planning and then, from the resulting plans a decision-tree is learned, using an established machine-learning algorithm, which forms the resulting policy. We evaluate our approach in simulation and report on sea trials of a prototype of a learned policy. We indicate some of the lessons learned from this deployed system and further evaluate an extended policy in simulation.

AB Despite the rapid advancement in the field of autonomous driving vehicles, developing a safe and sensible decision-making system remains a challenging problem. The driving decision-making module is one of the most essential sections of the entire autonomous driving system, and the decision generated from it can significantly impinge the lives and property of passengers. Complicated interactions among traffic participants have the most profound impact on the decision-making process, yet the interactions are often simplified or overlooked due to their complexity and implicit nature. To address this issue, this work proposes an Edge-Enhanced Graph Attention Reinforcement Learning (EGARL) framework that aims to make rational driving decisions by comprehensively modeling the interactions among agents. EGARL comprises three core components: a graphical representation of the traffic scenario that covers both topological and interactive information; an Edge-enhanced Graph Attention Network (E-GAT) that utilizes the graphical representation to extract interactive features by comprehensively considering nodes and edges of the graph; and a deep reinforcement learning method that generates driving decisions based on the current state and features extracted from E-GAT. Experimental results demonstrate the satisfying performance of EGARL. Our proposed framework can contribute to the development of intelligent transportation systems, enhancing the safety and efficiency of driving.

AB Motion planning for autonomous vehicles becomes more challenging when both driver comfort and collision risk are considered. To overcome this challenge, a human-like motion planning strategy based on the probabilistic prediction in a dynamic environment is proposed. In this study, it is mainly concerned with the following three aspects: the probabilistic prediction of states of the surrounding vehicles, decision making of the optimal path with a cost function and speed planning based on the driver's target speed. Firstly, the path generation is realized based on a fifth-degree polynomial and the desired path is optimized by a cost function with four performance indices, i.e., safety, consistency, smoothness, and distance from local path to global path. Secondly, collision detection is analyzed regarding the host vehicle and surrounding vehicles aspects. For the host vehicle, a path-tracking error relating to vehicle speed and road curvature is taken into account. For the surrounding vehicles, the probabilistic trajectory prediction is made by using the structural Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. Next, the collision probability is assessed using the Monte Carlo method and the optimal path is selected through the probability threshold depending on driver styles such as a conservative or aggressive driver. Moreover, the human-like speed planning for longitudinal motion is implemented considering driver target speed in vehicle following and vehicle cut-in situations. Finally, the proposed human-like motion planning algorithm has been validated via Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests. The simulation results have shown the effectiveness of dynamic obstacle avoidance with global path-tracking and speed-tracking with driver comfort. Parameter sensitivity analysis for cost function and speed planner is then performed. The sensitivity analysis and the results also illustrate the influence degree of various parameters on the planned trajectory, which would be conducive to further improving the algorithm performance in the future. With an appropriate selection of the weight ratio between safety and comfort proposed in this work, it is found that the driver's comfort acceptance will be improved compared with the traditional deterministic motion planning algorithm.

AB The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a promising platform for remote chemical sensing to minimize human contact with toxic chemicals. Most previous studies in this field used predefined paths to search for areas based on sensor measurements at fixed points. However, operations on a predefined flight path are inefficient because in real-life scenarios, gas dispersion is stochastic and unpredictable. Thus, a model-free reinforcement-learning approach using a deep Q-network for autonomous UAV control is proposed. The UAV automatically selects its trajectory based on sensor measurements and GPS location data to map the contaminated area in real time. Path planning is simulated using Gaussian model-based gas dispersion data and its feasibility in outdoor experiments using gas simulants is proved. This study provides guidelines for developing a model that can perform autonomous chemical detection and source localization using UAV.

AB This paper presents the architecture of an onboard controller developed for the HERO autonomous helicopter, which is a low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle research platform. An embedded digital-signal-processor-based low-level controller is devoted to flight control, while a PC-based high-level controller is used for onboard perception tasks and interaction with other agents in a distributed system. The functional design, software architecture, and implementation of the low-level controller are analyzed in detail, focusing mainly on its runtime environment (JULIET) and its capability for flexible reconfiguration. The connectivity functions of the low-level controller with external possibly distributed agents are also addressed. Finally, the results of real autonomous flight experiments are presented, including the tracking of a smooth 3-D path described by over two hundred waypoints.

The model provides insights by exploiting the fundamental relationships between various components in an aerial robot, such as sensor framerate, compute performance, and body dynamics (physics). F-1 serves as a tool that can aid computer and cyber-physical system architects to understand the optimal design (or selection) of various components in the development of autonomous machines.

TI An Integrated Lateral and Longitudinal Decision-Making Model for
   Autonomous Driving Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION

ID VEHICLES
AB Decision-making is an important component of autonomous driving perception, decision-making, planning, and control pipeline, which undertakes the task of how the ego vehicle makes high-level decision-making behaviors (such as lane change and car following) after sensing the environmental state, and then these high-level decision-making behaviors can be transmitted to the downstream planning and control module for specific low-level action execution. Based on the method of deep reinforcement learning (specifically, Deep Q network (DQN) and its variants), an integrated lateral and longitudinal decision-making model for autonomous driving is proposed in a multilane highway environment with both autonomous driving vehicle (ADV) and manual driving vehicle (MDV). The classic MOBIL and IDM models are used for the lateral and longitudinal decisions of MDV (i.e., lane changing and car following), while the lateral and longitudinal decisions of ADV are dominated by deep reinforcement learning models. In addition, this paper also uses the nonlinear kinematic bicycle model and two-point visual control model to realize the low-level control of both MDV and ADV. By setting a reasonable state, action, and reward function, this paper has carried out a large number of simulation experiments on the proposed autonomous driving decision-making model based on deep reinforcement learning in a three-lane road environment. The results show that under such scenario setting conditions, the deep reinforcement learning-based model proposed in this paper performs well in autonomous driving safety and travel efficiency. At the same time, when compared with the classical rule-based decision-making model (MOBIL&IDM), it is found that the model proposed in this paper can significantly achieve better results in episode rewards after stable training. In addition, through a large number of hyper-parameter tuning experiments, the performance of DQN, DDQN, and dueling DQN models, which are also deep reinforcement learning-based decision-making models, under different hyper-parametric configurations is compared and analyzed, which can provide a valuable reference for the specific scenario application of these models.

AB Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, are ubiquitous and their use cases extend today from governmental applications to civil applications such as the agricultural, medical, and transport sectors, etc. In accordance with the requirements in terms of demand, it is possible to carry out various missions involving several types of UAVs as well as various onboard sensors. According to the complexity of the mission, some configurations are required both in terms of hardware and software. This task becomes even more complex when the system is composed of autonomous UAVs that collaborate with each other without the assistance of an operator. Several factors must be considered, such as the complexity of the mission, the types of UAVs, the communication architecture, the routing protocol, the coordination of tasks, and many other factors related to the environment. Unfortunately, although there are many research works that address the use cases of multi-UAV systems, there is a gap in the literature regarding the difficulties involved with the implementation of these systems from scratch. This review article seeks to examine and understand the communication issues related to the implementation from scratch of autonomous multi-UAV systems for collaborative decisions. The manuscript will also provide a formal definition of the ecosystem of a multi-UAV system, as well as a comparative study of UAV types and related works that highlight the use cases of multi-UAV systems. In addition to the mathematical modeling of the collaborative target detection problem in distributed environments, this article establishes a comparative study of communication architectures and routing protocols in a UAV network. After reading this review paper, readers will benefit from the multicriteria decision-making roadmaps to choose the right architectures and routing protocols adapted for specific missions. The open challenges and future directions described in this manuscript can be used to understand the current limitations and how to overcome them to effectively exploit autonomous swarms in future trends.

AB This paper investigates solutions for the fundamental yet challenging problem of autonomous landing of multirotor Unammaned Aerial Vehicles UAVs. In addition to landing on static targets, tracking and landing on a moving platform is addressed, as a solution to facilitate the deployment of the UAV. The paper presents the design of a new landing pad and its relative pose estimation. The fusion of inertial measurement with the estimated pose is considered to ensure a high sampling rate, and to increase the manoeuvrability of the vehicle. Two filters are designed to conduct the fusion, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and an Extended H-a (EHa). The extensive simulation and practical tests permitted identification of the challenges of the landing task. Adequate solutions to these challenges are proposed to lessen their impact on landing precision.

AB The RDI WHN-600 Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) is a key navigation sensor for the HUGIN 1000 Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). HUGIN 1000 is designed for autonomous submerged operation for long periods of time. This is facilitated by a low drift velocity aided Inertial Navigation System (INS). Major factors determining the position error growth are the IMU and DVL error characteristics and the mission plan pattern. For instance, low frequency DVL errors cause an approximately linear drift in a straight-line trajectory, while these errors tend to be cancelled out by a lawn mower pattern. The paper focuses on the accuracy offered by the DVL. HUGIN 1000 is a permanent organic mine countermeasure (MCM) capacity on the Royal Norwegian Navy MCM vessel KNM Karmoy. HUGIN 1000 will be part of the NATO force MCMFORNORTH in fall 2004.

TI Evaluation and Optimization of Responsibility-Sensitive Safety Models on
   Autonomous Car-Following Maneuvers
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

ID CRUISE CONTROL; COLLISION; DESIGN
AB Safety is an important challenge in the development of autonomous vehicles (AVs). To ensure the safety of AVs, Intel and Mobileye have proposed a model called Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS). Previous studies have shown that RSS has the potential to improve the safety performance of AVs, especially for partial autonomous driving algorithms. However, it is been shown that RSS leads to a considerable car-following distance, which has a negative effect on traffic efficiency. To improve the efficiency of RSS when applied to adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems, this paper proposes an improved strategy that involves triggering conditions of RSS. Two triggers of safety distance are defined according to different car-following assumptions. To test the performance of RSS models, original and improved RSS models are embedded in ACC based on model predictive control (MPC) algorithms. Car-following scenarios with a sudden deceleration of the lead vehicle (LV) at various time headways are simulated to evaluate the performance of improved RSS models. Results show that triggering RSS at the boundary of the safety distance calculated by considering the vehicle's intentions is a better RSS model. This improved RSS model has a similar safety improvement effect to the ACC system as the original RSS in most risk scenarios and performs better in car-following efficiency. As the improved RSS model achieves a better trade-off between safety and efficiency, it can be used to improve the safety performance of partial autonomous driving algorithms like ACC on autonomous car-following maneuvers on expressways.

AB Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) have become very popular with a wide range of applications in cinema, surveillance, search and rescue, among many others. For these applications, an experienced pilot could operate the vehicle while keeping it in the line-of-sight. However, if the MAV flies beyond, the MAV may be highly compromised leading to potential crashes due to undetected obstacles. Hence, an assistance system to aid with obstacle detection and avoidance is highly desirable. This problem becomes more evident for autonomous navigation of MAVs. Nevertheless, autonomous navigation involves intensive computational power that rests on additional hardware to that of the flight controller. In addition, MAVs have an inherent limitation in their payload, restricting the size and weight of the onboard hardware and consequently the computational processing and storage capabilities. Motivated by the limitations in hardware, we propose a method to build an high-level map with enough details to make it useful for autonomous navigation, detecting surfaces that can be modeled as planes, thus enabling real-time operation while running on low budget hardware. Our proposed method carries out the following stages: (a) super-pixel segmentation, (b) planes extraction, (c) real-time mapping and (d) RRT navigation. We tested the proposed method in a custom-made hexacopter capable of carrying a stereoscopic camera and a light computer. We show that our MAV navigates in an unknown environment and successfully senses and avoids potential obstacles in its path.

AB Efficiency of many mobility services depends on effective matching of service vehicles and customers over time and space. New technologies, such as those related to service integrators and modularized autonomous vehicle platforms (i.e., chassis with built-in power and control systems), further allow pooling of vehicles from traditionally separate service operators to flexibly serve multiple types of customers (e.g., passengers and freight). Dynamic matching systems, if not carefully managed, suffer from the so-called wild goose chase (WGC) phe-nomenon, which describes an inefficient system equilibrium with a large number of vehicles trapped in unproductive deadheading. This paper proposes a new dynamic vehicle swap strategy that can be used to enhance system efficiency by reducing the expected waiting/deadheading time. This strategy can not only mitigate the WGC and reduce the needed fleet size, but also ensure that the vehicle swap achieves a Pareto improvement for each involved participant. Approximate analytic formulas are derived from a series of differential equations and spatial probability models to estimate the expected system performance in the steady state. This system of nonlinear equations can be solved numerically to yield the equilibrium points and the associated system performance metrics. Agent-based simulations are used to verify the accuracy of the derived formulas, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic and Pareto-improving swap strategy in a variety of application contexts (e.g., taxi, service integrator, or pooled modular chassis).

AB Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) have been currently considered as promising solutions for realization of envisioned autonomous traffic management systems in the future. CAVs can achieve high desired traffic efficiency and provide safe, energy-saving, and comfortable ride experience for passengers. However, in order to practically implement such autonomous systems based on CAVs, there exist several significant challenges to be dealt with, such as coupled spatiotemporal constraints on CAVs' trajectories at unsignalized intersections, multiple objectives for trajectory optimization in road segments, and heterogeneous decision-making behaviors of CAVs in road networks with highly dynamic traffic demand. In this paper, we propose a cooperative autonomous traffic organization method for CAVs in multi-intersection road networks. The methodological framework consists of threefold components: an autonomous crossing strategy based on a conflict resolution approach at unsignalized intersections, multi-objective trajectory optimization in road segments, and a composite strategy for route planning considering heterogeneous decision-making behaviors of CAVs based on social and individual benefit, respectively. Specifically, we first identify a set of potential conflict points of different CAVs' spatial trajectories at the intersection, and then design different minimum safe time headways to resolve conflicts. Under the constraints of entry and exit conditions at adjacent intersections, we propose a multi-objective optimal control model by jointly considering vehicle safety, energy conservation, and ride comfort, and then analytically derive a closed-form solution for optimizing the CAVs' trajectories. Furthermore, with the purpose to adapt dynamic traffic demand, we propose a composite strategy for route planning by coordinating heterogeneous decision-making behaviors of CAVs in road networks. Finally, extensive simulation experiments have been performed to validate our proposed method and to demonstrate its advantage over conventional baseline schemes in terms of global traffic efficiency. Additional numerical results are also provided to shed light on the impact of the proportion of CAVs with heterogeneous decision-making behaviors on the global system performance.

AB Maneuver planning, which plays a key role in selecting desired lanes and speeds, is an essential element of autonomous driving. Generally, for a vehicle driving on a multilane road, there are several potential maneuvers in both longitudinal and lateral directions. Selecting the best maneuver from the various options represents a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a maneuver selection algorithm and combine it with a trajectory generation algorithm, which is based on model predictive control (MPC). The maneuver selection method is a higher-level planner, which selects only one maneuver from all possible maneuvers based on the current situation and delivers it to a lower-level MPC-based trajectory tracking controller. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated by simulating an overtaking scenario on a multilane highway.

AB The paper deals with a novel enhanced connection of AC/AC powertrain for HEV hybrid vehicles. The substantial contribution of such a connection is the absence of 4QC auxiliary converter needed for autonomous and hybrid operational modes and its compensation by power-lesser 0x5 matrix converter. The main advantages of a simplified connection are beside smaller auxiliary converter sizing and possible better efficiency of the HEV powertrain. So, powertrain operation in autonomous traction accu-battery modes uses direct 0x5 configuration of traction 3x5 MxC matrix converter and in hybrid modes of ICE engine and accu-battery, besides traction 3x5 MxC matrix converter, uses the auxiliary 0x5 matrix converter. Modeling and simulation using Matlab-Simulink environment of traction powertrain configuration in autonomous modes are presented in the paper, as well as all simulation experiment results.

TI Sum of gaussian single beacon range-only localization for AUV homing
SO ANNUAL REVIEWS IN CONTROL
LA English
DT Review
DE AUV; Robot navigation; Range data; Kalman filters; Particle filters
AB Range-only measurements are extensively used in many Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) applications. These measurements do not depend on water quality and can be taken from long distances. This paper proposes two methods based on the Sum of Gaussian (SoG) filter, to solve the range-only localization problem for homing. The use of the SoG allows us to combine the benefits of both a Particle Filter (PF) and an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) approach in a single filter. An Active Localization (AL) method is applied to the SoG to autonomously choose the best waypoints for autonomous convergence. Both the SoG filter and the AL are tested in a real scenario with an Intervention Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (I-AUV) and compared with a vision-based method to confirm localization.

AB In the past decades, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged in a wide range of applications. Owing to the advances in UAV technologies related to sensing, computing, power, etc., it has become possible to carry out missions autonomously. A key component to achieving this goal is the development of safe navigation methods, which is the main focus of this work. A hybrid navigation approach is proposed to allow safe autonomous operations in three-dimensional (3D) partially unknown and dynamic environments. This method combines a global path planning algorithm, namely RRT-Connect, with a reactive control law based on sliding mode control to provide quick reflex-like reactions to newly detected obstacles. The performance of the suggested approach is validated using simulations.

AB This paper presents the design of the interacting-BoomCopter (I-BoomCopter) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for mounting a remote sensor package on a vertical surface. Critical to the design is the novel, custom, light-weight passive end effector. The end effector has a forward-facing sonar sensor and in-line force sensor to enable autonomous sensor mounting tasks. The I-BoomCopter's front boom is equipped with a horizontally mounted propeller, which can provide forward and reverse thrust with zero roll and pitch angles. The design and modeling of the updated I-BoomCopter platform is presented along with prototype flight test results. A teleoperated wireless camera sensor mounting task examines the updated platform's suitability for mounting remote sensor packages. Additionally, an autonomous control strategy for remote sensor mounting with the I-BoomCopter is proposed, and autonomous test flights demonstrate the efficacy of the approach.

ID AUTONOMOUS EMERGENCY BRAKING; THREAT ASSESSMENT; SYSTEM; RISK
AB This paper presents a method to identify inevitable collision states (ICS) specifically for a motorcycle when interacting with an opponent passenger car in typical traffic scenarios. Previous ICS methods were applied to passenger cars or generic vehicles; however, the peculiarities of motorcycles urge the definition of specific methods for these vehicles. The findings extend the applicability of previous algorithms to include all motorcycle-to-car collisions, irrespective of collision configurations. ICS identification can be adopted as a triggering criterion for more invasive safety systems such as motorcycle autonomous emergency braking (MAEB), which require a last-resort approach in their initial phases of development. In this regard, this paper also presents an evaluation of an idealized MAEB through experiments simulating real-world crashes in a computer-based virtual environment.

AB Recently, autonomous driving becomes a hot topic in research and industry area. Autonomous driving technology needs to perceive the semantic information of road scenes in the all-day and open environment. In this article, the semantic recognition of traffic scenes is studied using a deep learning network model, and a semantic representation model of road scenes is established. Besides, a semantic recognition algorithm of road scenes based on image data is proposed. Finally, a self-built data set is used to train the proposed model, and verified in the field of the test vehicle. It is found that the proposed method can quickly capture the perceptual road scene and over-performs better than traditional methods and demonstrated great potential to be used in road scene applications.

AB Autonomous aerial refueling (AAR) is an essential application of unmanned aerial vehicles for both military and civilian domains. In this paper, a hybrid algorithm of the pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO) and lateral inhibition (LI), called LI-PIO, is proposed for image matching problem of AAR. LI is adopted for image pre-processing to enhance the edges and contrast of images. PIO, inspired from the homing characteristics of pigeons, is a novel bio-inspired swarm intelligence algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of our proposed algorithm, we make extensive comparative experiments with particle swarm optimization (PSO), particle swarm optimization based on lateral inhibition (LI-PSO), and PIO. It can be concluded from the experimental results that our proposed LI-PIO has excellent performances for image matching problem of AAR, especially in convergent rate and computation speed.

AB This paper discusses how phase plane analysis can be used to describe the overall behavior of single and multiple autonomous robotic vehicles with finite state machine rules. The importance of this result is that we can begin to design provably stable group behaviors from a set of simple control laws and appropriate switching points with decentralized variable structure control. The ability to prove stable group behavior is especially important for applications such as locating military targets or land mines. In this paper, we demonstrate how phase plane analysis has been used to explain the behavior of a 16 cm(3) autonomous line-tracking robot with four finite states. After which, the analysis is extended to include the design of a decentralized variable structure controller that guides multiple vehicles to a goal while avoiding each other.

AB The interest in autonomous vehicles has increased exponentially in recent years. While Lidar is a proven autonomous driving technology, end-to-end learning approaches have become popular as computer performance has improved. A fully end-to-end method-NVIDIA's PilotNet has shown its ability to predict speed and steering angle with only camera images. This method achieved the Lidar-based methods' performance in simple driving tasks. However, a significant drawback was no past spatiotemporal information, imposing an error-sensitive performance, especially in complex driving tasks. Spurred by this deficiency, this paper introduces two novel models: CNN + LSTM and CNN3D, aiming for complex autonomous driving tasks in indoor environments.

AB This paper presents a technique for longitudinal control of road vehicles. The technique is based on the calculation of safety distances between two vehicles and uses an optimal control strategy to regulate the speed and position of the controlled vehicle. The technique we propose can be used either for platooning strategies or for autonomous control, i.e., without cooperation or communication between vehicles or with the infrastructure required. We mainly focus on the latter aspect, in which case only measurements of the distance from the preceding vehicle are required, and can be obtained by means of a LiDAR or any equivalent system. First, we study the vehicle model and the control law, then we present simulations, stability results and evaluations.

AB This paper presents a sensor fusion-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing attack detection framework for autonomous vehicles (AVs) that consists of two strategies: (i) comparison between predicted location shift-i.e., distance traveled between two consecutive timestamps-and inertial sensor based location shift in addition to monitoring of vehicle motion states-i.e., standstill/ in motion; and (ii) detection and classification of turns (left or right) along with detection of vehicle motion states. In the first strategy, data from low-cost in-vehicle inertial sensors-i.e., speedometer, accelerometer, and steering angle sensor-are fused and fed to a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the distance an AV will travel between two consecutive timestamps. The second strategy combines k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithms to detect a turn and then classify left and right turns using steering angle sensor output. In both strategies, the GNSS-derived speed is compared with speedometer output to improve the effectiveness of the framework presented in this paper. To prove the efficacy of the sensor fusion-based attack detection framework, attack datasets are created for four unique spoofing attack scenarios-turn-by-turn, overshoot, wrong turn, and stop, using the publicly available real-world Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset (HDD). Analyses conducted in this study reveal that the sensor fusion-based detection framework successfully detects all four types of spoofing attacks within the required computational latency threshold.

AB Area coverage with an onboard sensor is an important task for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with many applications. Autonomous fixed-wing UAVs are more appropriate for larger scale area surveying since they can cover ground more quickly. However, their non-holonomic dynamics and susceptibility to disturbances make sensor coverage a challenging task. Most previous approaches to area coverage planning are offline and assume that the UAV can follow the planned trajectory exactly. In this paper, this restriction is removed as the aircraft maintains a coverage map based on its actual pose trajectory and makes control decisions based on that map. The aircraft is able to plan paths in situ based on sensor data and an accurate model of the on-board camera used for coverage. An information theoretic approach is used that selects desired headings that maximize the expected information gain over the coverage map. In addition, the branch entropy concept previously developed for autonomous underwater vehicles is extended to UAVs and ensures that the vehicle is able to achieve its global coverage mission. The coverage map over the workspace uses the projective camera model and compares the expected area of the target on the ground and the actual area covered on the ground by each pixel in the image. The camera is mounted on a two-axis gimbal and can either be stabilized or optimized for maximal coverage. Hardware-in-the-loop simulation results and real hardware implementation on a fixed-wing UAV show the effectiveness of the approach. By including the already developed automatic takeoff and landing capabilities, we now have a fully automated and robust platform for performing aerial imagery surveys.

AB Robots and industrial vehicles are becoming more and more autonomous. Currently, the robots are not able to carry out all tasks autonomously, but the number of those tasks is increasing. Semi- autonomous robots are changing the requirements of control stations for their surveillance and control. These new technologies will provide the possibility to have a single operator command and supervise multiple (semi-) autonomous systems. This requires new control stations, which support remote control and also commanding autonomous actions, like executing a movement command to a specific position. Here, we provide a concept that combines classic and future control stations, that can already be used with the current state of the art in robotics.

AB Autonomous driving is an important branch of artificial intelligence, and real-time and accurate object detection is key to ensuring the safe and stable operation of autonomous vehicles. To this end, this paper proposes a fast and accurate object detector for autonomous driving based on improved YOLOv5. First, the YOLOv5 algorithm is improved by using structural re-parameterization (Rep), enhancing the accuracy and speed of the model through training-inference decoupling. Additionally, the neural architecture search method is introduced to cut redundant branches in the multi-branch re-parameterization module during the training phase, which ameliorates the training efficiency and accuracy. Finally, a small object detection layer is added to the network and the coordinate attention mechanism is added to all detection layers to improve the recognition rate of the model for small vehicles and pedestrians. The experimental results show that the detection accuracy of the proposed method on the KITTI dataset reaches 96.1%, and the FPS reaches 202, which is superior to many current mainstream algorithms and effectively improves the accuracy and real-time performance of unmanned driving object detection.

AB Autonomous aerial robots provide new possibilities to study the habitats and behaviors of endangered species through the efficient gathering of location information at temporal and spatial granularities not possible with traditional manual survey methods. We present a novel autonomous aerial vehicle system-TrackerBots-to track and localize multiple radio-tagged animals. The simplicity of measuring the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values of very high frequency (VHF) radio-collars commonly used in the field is exploited to realize a low-cost and lightweight tracking platform suitable for integration with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Due to uncertainty and the nonlinearity of the system based on RSSI measurements, our tracking and planning approaches integrate a particle filter for tracking and localizing and a partially observable Markov decision process for dynamic path planning. This approach allows autonomous navigation of a UAV in a direction of maximum information gain to locate multiple mobile animals and reduce exploration time and, consequently, conserve on-board battery power. We also employ the concept of search termination criteria to maximize the number of located animals within power constraints of the aerial system. We validated our real-time and online approach through both extensive simulations and field experiments with five VHF radio-tags on a grassland plain.

AB Methodologies and algorithms are presented for the secure cooperation of a team of autonomous mobile underwater sensors, connected through an acoustic communication network, within surveillance and patrolling applications. In particular, the work proposes a cooperative algorithm in which the mobile underwater sensors (installed on Autonomous Underwater Vehicles-AUVs) respond to simple local rules based on the available information to perform the mission and maintain the communication link with the network (behavioral approach). The algorithm is intrinsically robust: with loss of communication among the vehicles the coverage performance (i.e., the mission goal) is degraded but not lost. The ensuing form of graceful degradation provides also a reactive measure against Denial of Service. The cooperative algorithm relies on the fact that the available information from the other sensors, though not necessarily complete, is trustworthy. To ensure trustworthiness, a security suite has been designed, specifically oriented to the underwater scenario, and in particular with the goal of reducing the communication overhead introduced by security in terms of number and size of messages. The paper gives implementation details on the integration between the security suite and the cooperative algorithm and provides statistics on the performance of the system as collected during the UAN project sea trial held in Trondheim, Norway, in May 2011.

AB The proliferation of ride sharing systems is a major drive in the advancement of autonomous and electric vehicle technologies. This paper considers the joint routing, battery charging, and pricing problem faced by a profit-maximizing transportation service provider that operates a fleet of autonomous electric vehicles. We first establish the static planning problem by considering time-invariant system parameters and determine the optimal static policy. While the static policy provides stability of customer queues waiting for rides even if consider the system dynamics, we see that it is inefficient to utilize a static policy as it can lead to long wait times for customers and low profits. To accommodate for the stochastic nature of trip demands, renewable energy availability, and electricity prices and to further optimally manage the autonomous fleet given the need to generate integer allocations, a real-time policy is required. The optimal real-time policy that executes actions based on full state information of the system is the solution of a complex dynamic program. However, we argue that it is intractable to exactly solve for the optimal policy using exact dynamic programming methods and therefore apply deep reinforcement learning to develop a near-optimal control policy. The two case studies we conducted in Manhattan and San Francisco demonstrate the efficacy of our real-time policy in terms of network stability and profits, while keeping the queue lengths up to 200 times less than the static policy.

AB The traffic congestion and accidents can be relieved by deploying the software defined internet of vehicles (SDN-IoV). However, the traffic of pedestrians and vehicles is particularly heavy near commercial streets and campuses. In particular scenarios, the SDN-IoV may not ensure the quality of service (QoS) for pedestrians and vehicles. In this paper, we construct a novel system architecture consisting of multiple non-cooperative unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and a SDN-IoV. The non-cooperative UAV is equipped with an antenna array to receive the signals from the vehicles and pedestrians of SDN-IoV. In order to locate the positions of vehicles and pedestrians, two source enumeration methods are proposed in a complex SDN-IoV environment with color noise. The projection matrix of the low dimensional signal subspace is constructed by the proposed criterion based on signal subspace projection (SSP). The sequence of the projected difference values of the local covariance matrix is applied to estimate the number of vehicles and pedestrians. The eigenvalues can be grouped to construct different subspaces by the proposed eigen-subspace projection (ESP). By projecting a new covariance matrix into the eigen-subspaces, the variance of values represents the projection difference can be exploited to estimate the number of vehicles and pedestrians. Simulation results and real system test verify the validity of the two proposed methods by comparing them with the state-of-the-art methods.

AB In control theory, a controller parameter-tuning method called virtual reference feedback tuning (VRFT) is proposed. VRFT can tune a feedback controller using single experimental data. If VRFT can be applied to a vehicle, the yaw-rate controller can be adequately tuned without the need for a vehicle model. Therefore, this study expands the results of VRFT to realize the desired yaw-rate control of autonomous vehicles. The key point of the proposed method is to realize the auto-tuning of the gain-schedule proportional-integral (PI) controller based on the vehicle velocity. In this study, the validity of the proposed method using a vehicle dynamics block set is verified.

AB The use of evolutionary methods to generate controllers for real-world autonomous agents has attracted recent attention. Most of the pertinent research has employed genetic algorithms or variations thereof. Recent research has indicated that the presence of epistasis drastically slows down genetic algorithms. For this reason, this paper uses a different evolutionary method, evolution strategies, for the evolution of various (complex) neuronal control architectures for mobile robots inspired by Braitenberg vehicles. In these experiments, the evolution strategy accelerates the development process by more than an order of magnitude (a few hours compared to more than two days). Furthermore, the evolution strategy yields the same efficacy when applied to receptive-field controllers that require many more parameters than Braitenberg controllers. This dramatic speedup is very important, since the development process is to be done in real robots.

AB Variable speed limit systems where variable message signs are used to show speed limits adjusted to the prevailing road or traffic conditions are installed on motorways in many countries. The objectives of variable speed limit system installations are often to decrease the number of accidents and to increase traffic efficiency. Currently, there is an interest in exploring the potential of cooperative intelligent transport systems including communication between vehicles and/or vehicles and the infrastructure. In this paper, we study the potential benefits of introducing infrastructure to vehicle communication, autonomous vehicle control and individualized speed limits in variable speed limit systems. We do this by proposing a cooperative variable speed limit system as an extension of an existing variable speed limit system. In the proposed system, communication between the infrastructure and the vehicles is used to transmit variable speed limits to upstream vehicles before the variable message signs become visible to the drivers. The system is evaluated by the means of microscopic traffic simulation. Traffic efficiency and environmental effects are considered in the analysis. The results of the study show benefits of the infrastructure to vehicle communication, autonomous vehicle control and individualized speed limits for variable speed limit systems in the form of lower acceleration rates and thereby harmonized traffic flow and reduced exhaust emissions.

TI DETECTING MALWARE ON X86-BASED IoT DEVICES IN AUTONOMOUS DRIVING
SO IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS

ID KEY MANAGEMENT SCHEME
AB X86-based software runs on some mainstream autonomous driving systems to perform intelligent operations and help to significantly improve driving safety. However, vulnerabilities of software in autonomous driving can lead to vehicle components and systems being attacked, which ultimately affects the work of the autonomous vehicle. Although many scholars have detected malware on X86-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices through static or dynamic analysis, these methods cannot be directly ported to X86-based IoT devices in autonomous driving because of hardware and software capabilities and real-time requirements. In this work, we propose the detection of malware on X86-based IoT devices in an autonomous driving approach combining fusion features from static analysis and machine learning to solve problems of resource overhead for dynamic analysis and low accuracy of the static analysis. First, a feature extraction model based on the level of operation code is designed. Then fusion features at three different levels are extracted through unpacking programs. Finally, a detection model based on Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is used to discover malware on X86-based IoT devices in autonomous driving. On this basis, a malware detection approach based on fusion features is demonstrated. After that, we compare our approach with other identification approaches on a dataset consisting of 4169 samples, which includes 2379 malware and 1790 benign programs. Experimental results show that fusion features can significantly increase the recognition rate. Moreover, XGBoost has a higher recognition accuracy than other mainstream classification algorithms.

ID TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT
AB Future urban road traffic management is an example of a socially relevant problem that can be modeled as a large-scale, open, distributed system, composed of many autonomous interacting agents, which need to be controlled in a decentralized manner. In this context, advanced, reservation-based, intersection control-where autonomous vehicles controlled entirely by agents interact with a coordination facility that controls an intersection, to avoid collisions and minimize delays-will be a possible scenario in the near future. In this article, we seize the opportunities for multiagent learning offered by such a scenario, studying i) how vehicles, when approaching a reservation-based intersection, can coordinate their actions in order to improve their crossing times, and therefore, speed up the traffic flow through the intersection, and ii) how a set of reservation-based intersections can cooperatively act over an entire network of intersections in order to minimize travel times.

The main reason postulated is an increase in comfort and feasibility of on-board activities which will potentially change the way people perceive time spent in a vehicle and consequently their mode preferences. Understanding how value of time (VoT) might change and what will determine such change can be crucial when assessing the impact of vehicle automation. Recent studies address potential changes that automation might have on VoT based on analyses of time use and perception in current modes of transport or focusing only on the utility of driving autonomously. However, there is a lack of research addressing both-the utility of car driving compared with the utility of riding autonomously-from the user perspective. To address this research question, focus group discussions with car drivers were conducted. The data was analyzed using a thematic qualitative text analysis. The results suggest that the utility of car driving today, including aspects of driving pleasure, various (passive) activities performed in the car, and also driving as an activity itself, will counterbalance to a certain extent the effect of the benefits of autonomous driving, such as improved travel experience and feasibility of activities. Moreover, context-related and individual characteristics shape these effects. This paper summarizes the main study results, including potential short- and long-term travel behavior changes resulting from the availability of autonomous driving. Lastly, implications from the qualitative research for quantitative studies on value of travel time savings for autonomous vehicles are discussed.

AB This paper explores the execution of planned autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) missions where opportunities to achieve additional utility can arise during execution. The missions are represented as temporal planning problems, with hard goals and time constraints. Opportunities are soft goals with high utility. The probability distributions for the occurrences of these opportunities are not known, but it is known that they are unlikely, so it is not worth trying to anticipate their occurrence prior to plan execution. However, as they are high utility, it is worth trying to address them dynamically when they are encountered, as long as this can be done without sacrificing the achievement of the hard goals of the problem. We formally characterize the opportunistic planning problem, introduce a novel approach to opportunistic planning, and compare it with an on-board replanning approach in the domain of AUVs performing pillar expection and chain-following tasks.

AB Personal data harvested in the Internet of Things not only promises to be particularly valuable, but also particularly privacy-sensitive.
   Analysed with the power of specialized Artificial Intelligence, such data allows for potentially beneficial personalization of goods and services; however, it also facilitates data-driven exploitative contracting.
   For example, data collected by autonomous and connected vehicles enables innovative driving and safety features in a personalized version of autonomous driving; but it also invites exploitative contracts tailored to profit from the vulner-abilities of drivers and passengers.
   Current EU data protection, contract, and tort law arguably fail to rein in data-driven exploitative contracts.
   Three novel interventions aiming to infuse greater fairness into the code of the digital economy are discussed: (i) mandatory 'data safe' alternatives; (ii) personalized data protection; and (iii) procedural rules on algorithmic fairness.

AB Advances in the fields of autonomy software and environmental sampling techniques for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have recently allowed for the merging of oceanographic data collection with the testing of emerging marine technology. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Laboratory for Autonomous Marine Sensing Systems (LAMSS) group conducted an Internal Wave Detection Experiment in August 2010 with these advances in mind. The goal was to have multiple AUVs collaborate autonomously through onboard autonomy software and real-time underwater acoustic communication to monitor for the presence of internal waves by adapting to changes in the environment (specifically the temperature variations near the thermocline/pycnocline depth). The experimental setup, implementation, data, deployment results, and internal wave detection and quantification results are presented in this paper.

AB We present the design and evaluation of an architecture for collision avoidance and escape of mobile autonomous robots operating in unstructured environments. The approach mixes both reactive and deliberative components. This provides the vehicle's behavior designers with an explicit means to design-in avoidance strategies that match system requirements in concepts of operations and for robot certification. The now traditional three layer architecture is extended to include a fourth Scenario layer, where scripts describing specific responses are selected and parameterized on the fly. A local map is maintained using available sensor data, and adjacent objects are combined as they are observed. This has been observed to create safer trajectories. Objects have persistence and fade if not re-observed over time. In common with behavior based approaches, a reactive layer is maintained containing pre-defined knee jerk responses for extreme situations. The reactive layer can inhibit outputs from above. Path planning of updated goal point outputs from the Scenario layer is performed using a fast marching method made more efficient through lifelong planning techniques. The architecture is applied to applications with Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. Both simulated and open water tests are carried out to establish the performance and usefulness of the approach.

AB In this article, we address the disturbance/ uncertainty estimation of maritime autonomous surface ships (MASSs) with unknown internal dynamics, unknown external disturbances, and unknown input gains. In contrast to existing disturbance observers where some prior knowledge on kinetic model parameters such as the control input gains is available in advance, reduced- and full-order data-driven adaptive disturbance observers (DADOs) are proposed for estimating unknown input gains, as well as total disturbance composed of unknown internal dynamics and external disturbances. An advantage of the proposed DADOs is that the total disturbance and input gains can be simultaneously estimated with guaranteed convergence via data-driven adaption. We apply the proposed full-order DADO for the trajectory tracking control of an MASS without kinetic modeling and present a model-free trajectory tracking control law for the ship based on the DADO and a backstepping technique. We report the simulation results to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed DADO approach to model-free trajectory tracking control of an autonomous surface ship without knowing its dynamics.

AB The energy efficiency and flight endurance of small unmanned aerial vehicles (SUAVs) can be improved through the implementation of autonomous soaring strategies. Biologically inspired flight techniques such as dynamic and thermal soaring offer significant energy savings through the exploitation of naturally occurring wind phenomena for thrustless flight. Recent interest in the application of artificial intelligence algorithms for autonomous soaring has been motivated by the pursuit of instilling generalized behavior in control systems, centered around the use of neural networks. However, the topology of such networks is usually predetermined, restricting the search space of potential solutions, while often resulting in complex neural networks that can pose implementation challenges for the limited hardware onboard small-scale autonomous vehicles. In exploring a novel method of generating neurocontrollers, this paper presents a neural network-based soaring strategy to extend flight times and advance the potential operational capability of SUAVs. In this study, the Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm is used to train efficient and effective neurocontrollers that can control a simulated aircraft along sustained dynamic and thermal soaring trajectories. The proposed approach evolves interpretable neural networks in a way that preserves simplicity while maximizing performance without requiring extensive training datasets. As a result, the combined trajectory planning and aircraft control strategy is suitable for real-time implementation on SUAV platforms.

AB Recently, there has been a rapid increase in electric vessels as in electric land vehicles. Since vessels such as ferries and ships operate on a specific schedule, the time to be spent for charging on the shore is limited. The charging process involves connecting equipment, transferring energy, and disconnecting equipment. The faster and easier connection and disconnection process is, the more time is for energy transfer. This paper introduces a novel autonomous robotic charging system that combines Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), embedded platform, camera, and lasers to detect the vessel's charging socket in the charging area by computer vision. Initially, the embedded platform detects the charging socket and position of the electric vessel with the camera using You-Only-Look-Once (YOLOv5). After that, when the charging socket is detected, laser sensors control it more precisely to align the robotic charging station and move it closer to the socket on the ship. Finally, the precise location information is transmitted to the PLC, and the robotic charging station transfers energy until the charging process is completed. Consequently, the proposed system achieved 94% accuracy in charging socket detection. This research can be a guide in demonstrating the shore-to-ship socket detection efficiency of autonomous and computer vision-based ship charging systems.

AB Traffic at larger or busier urban intersections is currently coordinated using traffic signals to prevent dangerous traffic situations and to regulate the flow of traffic. In future scenarios with 100% connected automated vehicles, conventional traffic signals could be replaced, and vehicles at intersections could be seamlessly coordinated via vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. In the past two decades, many such control strategies have been presented, commonly referred to as autonomous intersection management (AIM). In recent years, an evolution from simpler first come, first served to more sophisticated optimization-based AIM strategies can be observed. Optimization-based AIM can significantly improve capacity and reduce delays as compared to slot-based strategies and conventional traffic signal control (TSC). In addition, it allows for prioritizing road users. This paper is among the first to consider pedestrians in optimization-based AIM. The proposed approach consists of a signal-free vehicle control in combination with pedestrian signal phases that are fully integrated into the optimization problem. Since the communication range of the controller is limited in real-world applications, a rolling horizon scheme is presented and explained in detail. The presented strategy is implemented and evaluated using a microscopic traffic simulation framework. Results show that vehicle delays can be significantly reduced and vehicle capacity can be increased compared to fully actuated TSC, while pedestrian waiting times are comparable. In addition, focus is put on how vehicle and pedestrian delays can be balanced in the presented setup. Three different control parameters can be adjusted, which need to be tuned based on the considered demand scenario.

ID CURVATURE
AB We study the problem of automatic generation of smooth and obstacle-avoiding planar paths for efficient guidance of autonomous mining vehicles. Fast traversal of a path is of special interest. We consider four-wheel four-gear articulated vehicles and assume that we have an a priori knowledge of the mine wall environment in the form of polygonal chains. Computing quartic uniform B-spline curves, minimizing curvature variation, staying at least at a proposed safety margin distance from the mine walls, we plan high speed paths.
   We present a study where our implementations are successfully applied on eight path-planning cases arising from real-world mining data provided by the Swedish mining company Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB (LKAB). The results from the study indicate that our proposed methods for computing obstacle-avoiding minimum curvature variation B-splines yield paths that are substantially better than the ones used by LKAB today. Our simulations show that, with an average 32.13%, the new paths are faster to travel along than the paths currently in use. Preliminary results from the production at LKAB show an overall 5%-10% decrease in the total time for an entire mining cycle. Such a cycle includes both traveling, ore loading, and unloading.
   Note to Practitioners-This article was motivated by the problem of how to automatically produce high quality drive-paths for autonomous transportation vehicles in mines. The vehicles are heavy (100 tonnes) but are still expected to run at speeds up to 20 km/h to be productive. To reach these speeds without damaging the steering gear and the mechanics of the vehicles, their paths need to be smooth. It turns out that visual inspection is often insufficient to produce a path with high smoothness. We suggest a method for computing paths, requiring an a priori knowledge about the environment, that minimizes the amount of steering needed. The computed paths are safe as they guarantee no collisions between the vehicle and the tunnel wall. We present a study of eight cases based on real-world application data from the Swedish mining company Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB (LKAB) showing that, with an average of 32.13%, our paths are faster to travel along than the paths currently in use.

AB This paper proposes a multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled autonomous mobile edge comput-ing (MEC) system, in which several UAVs are deployed to provide services to user devices (UDs). The aim is to reduce/minimize the overall energy consumption of the autonomous system via designing the optimal trajectories of multiple UAVs. The problem is very complicated to be solved by traditional methods, as one has to take into account the deployment updation of stop points (SPs), the association of SPs with UDs and UAVs, and the optimal trajectories designing of UAVs. To tackle this problem, we propose a variable-length trajectory planning algorithm (VLTPA) consisting of three phases. In the first phase, the deployment of SPs is updated via presenting a genetic algorithm (GA) having variable -length individuals. Accordingly, the association between UDs and SPs is addressed by using a close rule. Finally, a multi-chrome GA is proposed to jointly handle the association of SPs with UAVs and their order for UAVs. The proposed VLTPA is tested via performing extensive experiments on eight instances ranging from 60 to 200 UDs, which reveal that the proposed VLTPA outperforms other compared state-of-the-art algorithms.(c) 2021 ISA.

AB To reduce the number of collision fatalities at crossroads intersections, many countries have started replacing intersections with non-signalized roundabouts, forcing the drivers to be more situationally aware and to adapt their behaviors according to the scenario. A non-signalized roundabout adds to the autonomous vehicle planning challenge, as navigating such interaction-dependent scenarios safely, efficiently, and comfortably has been a challenge even for human drivers. Unlike traffic signal-controlled roundabouts, where the merging order is centrally controlled, driving a non-signalized roundabout requires the individual actor to make the decision to merge based on the movement of other interacting actors. Most traditional autonomous planning approaches use rule-based speed assignment for generating admissible motion trajectories, which work successfully in non-interaction-based driving scenarios. They, however, are less effective in interaction-based scenarios as they lack the necessary ability to adapt the vehicle's motion according to the evolving driving scenario. In this paper, we demonstrate an adaptive tactical behavior planner (ATBP) for an autonomous vehicle that is capable of planning human-like motion behaviors for navigating a non-signalized roundabout, combining naturalistic behavior planning and tactical decision-making algorithm. The human driving simulator experiment used to learn the behavior planning approach and the ATBP design is described in this paper.

The goal is to perform such a coverage task when the capability of the vehicles to carry out the task varies through time. We consider variable sensing performance and the loss of vehicles. Algorithms are proposed to enable coverage despite such variable health conditions. These algorithms are validated through experiments with quad-rotor unmanned air vehicles. Since these algorithms require communication among the vehicles, simulations are carried out to show that the proposed algorithms degrade nicely when perfect communication is not possible.

One can view an automated vehicle as having Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities, being able to self-drive, sense its surroundings, recognise objects in its vicinity, and perform reasoning and decision-making. Rather than being stand alone, we examine the need for automated vehicles to cooperate and interact within their socio-cyber-physical environments, including the problems cooperation will solve, but also the issues and challenges. We review current work in cooperation for automated vehicles, based on selected examples from the literature. We conclude noting the need for the ability to behave cooperatively as a form of social-AI capability for automated vehicles, beyond sensing the immediate environment and beyond the underlying networking technology.

AB Real-time, accurate, and robust localisation is critical for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to achieve safe, efficient driving, whilst real-time performance is essential for AVs to achieve their current position in time for decision making. To date, no review paper has quantitatively compared the realtime performance between different localisation techniques based on various hardware platforms and programming languages and analysed the relations among localisation methodologies, real-time performance and accuracy. Therefore, this paper discusses the state-of-the-art localisation techniques and analyses their overall performance in AV application. For further analysis, this paper firstly proposes a localisation algorithm operations capability (LAOC)-based equivalent comparison method to compare the relative computational complexity of different localisation techniques; then, it comprehensively discusses the relations among methodologies, computational complexity, and accuracy. Analysis results show that the computational complexity of localisation approaches differs by a maximum of about 107 times, whilst accuracy varies by about 100 times. Vision- and data fusion- based localisation techniques have about 2-5 times potential for improving accuracy compared with lidar-based localisation. Lidar- and vision-based localisation can reduce computational complexity by improving image registration method efficiency. Data fusion-based localisation can achieve better realtime performance compared with lidar- and vision-based localisation because each standalone sensor does not need to develop a complex algorithm to achieve its best localisation potential. Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology can improve positioning robustness. Finally, the potential solutions and future orientations of AVs' localisation based on the quantitative comparison results are discussed.

AB Shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEVs) are expected to become a popular choice for urban transportation in the future. A solution to a vehicle routing problem that considers congestion and energy consumption of SAEVs is proposed to assist green transportation under poor traffic conditions. In addition to routing the fleet of SAEVs to serve customers, the proposed method also determines the vehicle speed in each arc and the departure time at each node by minimizing the cost considering the travel distance, energy con-sumption, and travel time. In the time-dependent vehicle routing problem with departure time and speed optimization for SAEV service (SAEV-TD-VRP-DSO), the electric vehicles (EVs) exchange batteries at battery swapping stations (BSSs), and the corresponding ve-hicle routing method also includes recharge scheduling. We develop a mixed-integer lin-ear model (MILP) to formulate the SAEV-TD-VRP-DSO and show that the state-of-the-art commercial optimization solver (CPLEX) can only solve a few instances (no more than 8 requests). Thus, an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm is proposed to find near-optimal solutions for larger-size instances. The removal and insertion operators of ALNS help optimize the node sequences. A departure time and speed optimization pro-cedure (DSOP) is employed to optimize the speed and departure time in each arc. The good performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated using instance sets. The op-timization results of a case study in the Yanta Administrative District in Xi'an, China, show that speed and departure time optimization result in 24.99% cost savings. The sensitivity analysis results provide the SAEV operators with alternative cost-saving solutions. Empty vehicles traveling at a slower speed can reduce energy cost. The total cost of operating ve-hicles with passengers can be reduced by avoiding congestion and utilizing larger capacity batteries (32 kWh or more) and a lower minimum battery level (0.2-0.3).

AB Sensor fusion plays a key part in autonomous surface vehicles, however, the high cost of sensors makes the barrier of entry in this research field quite high. In this work, we present a complete system for sensor fusion on the milliAmpere autonomous ferry research platform as well as an open sensor fusion dataset for maritime tracking across two environments. Individual sensors and their detection pipelines are evaluated across various detection metrics. We also evaluate the tracking performance of the sensors both individually and in fusion using a multi-sensor extension of the JIPDA multi-target tracker. We find that the different environments have distinct challenges precluding the use of only a single sensor. Utilizing multiple sensors, either individually or in fusion, can mitigate these issues increasing the safety margins of the situational awareness system.

AB In this paper a new reactive mechanism based on perception-action bionics for multi-sensory integration applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) navigation is proposed. The strategy is inspired by the olfactory bulb neural activity observed in rabbits subject to external stimuli. The new UAV navigation technique exploits the use of a multiscroll chaotic system which is able to be controlled in real-time towards less complex orbits, like periodic orbits or equilibrium points, considered as perceptive orbits. These are subject to real-time modifications on the basis of environment changes acquired through a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensory system. The mathematical details of the approach are given including simulation results in a virtual environment. The results demonstrate the capability of autonomous navigation for UAV based on chaotic bionics theory in complex spatial environments.

TI Path Planning for Autonomous Articulated Vehicle Based on Improved
   Goal-Directed Rapid-Exploring Random Tree
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB The special steering characteristics and task complexity of autonomous articulated vehicle (AAV) make it often require multiple forward and backward movements during autonomous driving. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective method, named head correction with fixed wheel position (HC-FWP), for the demand of multiple forward and backward movements. The goal-directed rapid-exploring random tree (GDRRT) algorithm is first used to search for a feasible path in the obstacle map, and then, the farthest node search (FNS) algorithm is applied to obtain a series of key nodes, on which HC-FWP is used to correct AAV heading angles. Simulation experiments with Dynapac CC6200 articulated road roller parameters show that the proposed improved goal-directed rapid-exploring random tree (IGDRRT), consisting of GDRRT, FNS, and HC-FWP, can search a feasible path on maps that require the AAV to move back and forth.

AB The ability of ground vehicles to quickly and accurately analyse their dynamic response to a given input is critical to their safety and efficient autonomous operation. In field conditions, significant uncertainty is associated with terrain and/or vehicle parameter estimates, and this uncertainty must be considered in the analysis of vehicle motion dynamics. Here, polynomial chaos approaches that explicitly consider parametric uncertainty during modelling of vehicle dynamics are presented. They are shown to be computationally more efficient than the standard Monte Carlo scheme, and experimental results compared with the simulation results performed on ANVEL (a vehicle simulator) indicate that the method can be utilised for efficient and accurate prediction of vehicle motion in realistic scenarios.

AB It is expected that a key part of a future with increasing use of maritime autonomous systems, will require collaborative and integrated approaches to working. How such approaches can be developed and tested was the focus of the Integrated Mission Management Systems 2019 project. The immediate objective was to experimentally demonstrate the ability of a single mission management system to control a fleet of heterogeneous, multi-domain autonomous vehicles whereby their collaborative mission could be planned, verified, and delivered. To challenge the various spatial-temporal-energetic-communication-environmental constraints when operating such a fleet, real-world demonstration trials were carried out in Plymouth Sound deployed from the Thales Maritime Autonomy Centre at Turnchapel Wharf. The trials were focussed on providing essential information into how such collaborations can be best executed, alongside invaluable lessons as to how existing vehicles need to enhance their interoperability and in particular, robustness of communications and mission plans.

AB Autonomous driving has attracted significant attention in recent years. With the booming of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning technologies have been applied to autonomous driving to help vehicles better perceive the environment. Besides the perceiving environment, predictive driving is another prominent smooth control and safe driving skill for human drivers. In this work, we develop a deep Monte Carlo Tree Search (deep-MCTS) control method for vision-based autonomous driving. Compared with existing deep learning-based autonomous driving control methods, our method can predict driving maneuvers to help improve the stability and performance of driving control. Two deep neural networks (DNNs) are employed for predicting action-state transformation and obtaining action-selection probabilities, respectively. The deep-MCTS utilizes the predicted information of the two DNNs and reconstructs multiple possible trajectories to predict driving maneuvers. An optimal trajectory is selected by the deep-MCTS based on both current road conditions and predicted driving maneuvers. The proposed method achieves high control stability by avoiding sharp turns and driving deviations. We implement our algorithm in the Udacity and Torcs self-driving environments. The testing results show that our algorithm achieves a significant improvement in training efficiency, the stability of steering control, and stability of driving trajectory compared to existing methods.

AB Autonomous Underwater Helicopter (AUH) is a novel dish-shaped multi-functional submersible vehicle in the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) family. Numerical study of launch and recovery system for AUVs from a research vessel is significant in the overall design. Single-arm crane and air-launch way are the important ways of launching AUVs with the high expertise and security. However, AUVs are still easily subject to a huge impact load which can cause the body damage, malfunction of electronic components, and other serious accidents when AUVs are launching into water. In this paper, unsteady, incompressible, two-phase flow with identified boundary conditions was modeled in the computational domain using Volume of Fluid (VOF) technology, and different overset-grid sizes were set and analyzed to ascertain the accuracy of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation first due to the setting of the grid which will directly affect the accuracy of the calculation results, especially the overset-grid convergence validation. Then, the change of water-entry impact force and velocity of AUH with different water-entry velocities and angles were calculated by CFD analysis software STAR-CCM + solver. The proper immersion angle of the AUH should be 75 degrees under comprehensive analysis and comparison. Besides, the variations of pressure distribution of the AUH in the whole water-entry process were also obtained, which provides reference for the shape optimization in the future work.

AB Curvy roads are a particular type of urban road scenario, wherein the curvature of the road centerline changes drastically. This paper is focused on the trajectory planning task for autonomous driving on a curvy road. The prevalent on-road trajectory planners in the Frenet frame cannot impose accurate restrictions on the trajectory curvature, thus easily making the resultant trajectories beyond the ego vehicle's kinematic capability. Regarding planning in the Cartesian frame, selection-based methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality. By contrast, optimization-based methods in the Cartesian frame are more flexible to find optima in the continuous solution space, but the new challenges are how to tackle the intractable collision-avoidance constraints and nonconvex kinematic constraints. An iterative computation framework is proposed to accumulatively handle the complex constraints. Concretely, an intermediate problem is solved in each iteration, which contains linear and tractably scaled collision-avoidance constraints and softened kinematic constraints. Compared with the existing optimization-based planners, our proposal is less sensitive to the initial guess especially when it is not kinematically feasible. The efficiency of the proposed planner is validated by both simulations and real-world experiments. Source codes of this work are available at https://github.com/libai1943/CartesianPlanner.

AB Accurate ship tracking is very important for the security of maritime activities, especially the raising requirements of autonomous navigation applications, e.g., autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). Unlike deep-learning-based object-tracking methods are prevailing in autonomous driving because of good environmental robustness and high tracking accuracy, few deep-tracking models can be found for maritime ships. The main reason for that is the lack of qualified ship datasets, especially datasets with ship-based perspectives. Therefore, a large-scale, high-definition dataset for ship tracking, LMD-TShip (Large Maritime Dataset), is provided in this paper. In this dataset, five types of ships are included, from cargo ships, fishing ships, passenger ships, and speed boats to unmanned ships. Specifically, LMD-TShip consists of 40,240 frames in 191 videos, each of which is carefully and manually annotated with bounding boxes in YOLO format. Moreover, 13 attributes are used to label videos, e.g., scale variation (SV), occlusion (OCC), basically covering tracking challenges of maritime ship tracking. Next, a detailed analysis is carried out to demonstrate the characteristics of LMD-TShip. Finally, experiments with five baseline short-term tracking models on the dataset are performed, e.g., ECO, SiamRPN++, and the experimental results demonstrate its good evaluation ability, which will provide effective means for training and testing tracking models related to maritime ships.

AB As part of ROBDEKON, a 24-ton crawler excavator was equipped with sensors and a digital actuation interface as a technology demonstrator which features autonomy capabilities. The system architecture includes algorithms for localization, perception, mapping, planning, and control. The system is capable of tasks like autonomous driving to a target location, excavation of a predefined area to a given depth, and autonomous loading of an autonomously approaching transport vehicle. To ensure safety, collision avoidance based on 360 degrees perception is always active during autonomous operation. This article presents the concept and implementation of the excavator's autonomy functionality.

AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) is regarded as the ultimate solution to future automotive engineering; however, safety still remains the key challenge for the development and commercialization of the AVs. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the development status of AVs and reported accidents is becoming urgent. In this article, the levels of automation are reviewed according to the role of the automated system in the autonomous driving process, which will affect the frequency of the disengagements and accidents when driving in autonomous modes. Additionally, the public on-road AV accident reports are statistically analyzed. The results show that over 3.7 million miles have been tested for AVs by various manufacturers from 2014 to 2018. The AVs are frequently taken over by drivers if they deem necessary, and the disengagement frequency varies significantly from 2 x 10(-4)to 3 disengagements per mile for different manufacturers. In addition, 128 accidents in 2014-2018 are studied, and about 63% of the total accidents are caused in autonomous mode. A small fraction of the total accidents (similar to 6%) is directly related to the AVs, while 94% of the accidents are passively initiated by the other parties, including pedestrians, cyclists, motorcycles, and conventional vehicles. These safety risks identified during on-road testing, represented by disengagements and actual accidents, indicate that the passive accidents which are caused by other road users are the majority. The capability of AVs to alert and avoid safety risks caused by the other parties and to make safe decisions to prevent possible fatal accidents would significantly improve the safety of AVs.Practical applications. This literature review summarizes the safety-related issues for AVs by theoretical analysis of the AV systems and statistical investigation of the disengagement and accident reports for on-road testing, and the findings will help inform future research efforts for AV developments.

AB An autonomous optimal trajectory planning method based on the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm of reinforcement learning (RL) for hypersonic vehicles (HV) is proposed in this paper. First, the trajectory planning problem is converted into a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and the amplitude of the bank angle is designated as the control input. The reward function of the MDP is set to minimize the trajectory terminal position errors with satisfying hard constraints. The deep neural network (DNN) is used to approximate the policy function and action-value function in the DDPG framework. The Actor network then computes the control input directly according to flight states. Using a limited exploration strategy, the optimal policy network would be considered fully trained when the reward value reached maximum convergence. Simulation results show that the policy network trained using a DDPG algorithm accomplishes 3-dimensional (3D) trajectory planning during the HV glide phase with high terminal precision and stable convergence. Additionally, the single step calculation time of the policy network occurs in near real time, which suggests great potential as an autonomous online trajectory planner. Monte Carlo experiments prove the strong robustness of the implementation of an autonomous trajectory planner under aerodynamic disturbances.

AB Autonomous parking has been a widely developed branch of intelligent transportation systems. In autonomous parking, maneuver planning is a crucial procedure that determines how intelligent the entire parking system is. This paper concerns planning time-optimal parallel parking maneuvers in a straightforward, accurate, and purely objective way. A unified dynamic optimization framework is established, which includes the vehicle kinematics, physical restrictions, collision-avoidance constraints, and an optimization objective. Interior-point method (IPM)-based simultaneous dynamic optimization methodology is adopted to solve the formulated dynamic optimization problem numerically. Given that near-feasible solutions have been widely acknowledged to ease optimizing nonlinear programs (NLPs), a critical region-based initialization strategy is proposed to facilitate the offline NLP-solving process, a lookup table-based strategy is proposed to guarantee the on-site planning performance, and a receding-horizon optimization framework is proposed for online maneuver planning. A series of parallel parking cases is tested, and simulation results demonstrate that our proposal is efficient even when the slot length is merely 10.19% larger than the car length. As a unified maneuver planner, our adopted IPM-based simultaneous dynamic optimization method can deal with any user-specified demand provided that it can be explicitly described.

AB This paper presents a novel intelligent multiple-controller framework incorporating a fuzzy-logic-based switching and tuning supervisor along with a generalised learning model (GLM) for an autonomous cruise control application. The proposed methodology combines the benefits of a conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, and a PID structure-based (simultaneous) zero and pole placement controller. The switching decision between the two nonlinear fixed structure controllers is made on the basis of the required performance measure using a fuzzy-logic-based supervisor, operating at the highest level of the system. The supervisor is also employed to adaptively tune the parameters of the multiple controllers in order to achieve the desired closed-loop system performance. The intelligent multiple-controller framework is applied to the autonomous cruise control problem in order to maintain a desired vehicle speed by controlling the throttle plate angle in an electronic throttle control (ETC) system. Sample simulation results using a validated nonlinear vehicle model are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the multiple-controller with respect to adaptively tracking the desired vehicle speed changes and achieving the desired speed of response, whilst penalising excessive control action.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are highly focused and widely used in various domains, and the capability of autonomous aerial refueling (AAR) becomes increasingly important. Most of the research in this area concerns the verification of the algorithms while the experiments are conducted on the ground. In this work, in order to verify the vision system designed for boom approach AAR, an integrated platform is built and tested. The platform consists of a tanker UAV, a receiver UAV and a ground station. The pictures of the marker on the receiver UAV are captured by the binocular vision system on the tanker UAV and then used for flight control and boom control. Performance and feasibility of the platform are demonstrated by the real out-door flight tests, and the experimental results verified the feasibility and effectiveness of our developed binocular vision-based UAVs AAR.

DE recursive Bayesian estimation; search and tracking
ID MONTE-CARLO; SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION
AB This paper presents a technique for dynamically reconfiguring search spaces in order to enable Bayesian autonomous search and tracking missions with moving targets. In particular, marine search and rescue scenarios are considered, highlighting the need for space reconfiguration in situations where moving targets are involved. The proposed technique improves the search space configuration by maintaining the validity of the recursive Bayesian estimation. The advantage of the technique is that autonomous search and tracking can be performed indefinitely, without loss of information. Numerical results first show the effectiveness of the technique with a single search vehicle and a single moving target. The efficacy of the approach for coordinated autonomous search and tracking is shown through simulation, incorporating multiple search vehicles and multiple targets. The examples also highlight the added benefit to human mission planners resulting from the technique's simplification of the search space allocation task.

AB This paper presents a novel embedding protocol that allows for safe and efficient operation of the Hybrid Autonomous Intersection Management (H-AIM) protocol concurrently with actuated and adaptive signal controllers. The proposed protocol extends H-AIM to allow it to cope with some operational uncertainty that is common in actuated signal controllers. A novel approach for computing safety bounds on signal timing is presented as a way of insuring safety in the face of demand uncertainty. Experimental results show the feasibility and effectiveness of combining H-AIM with actuated controllers for various levels of connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) market penetration and different combinations of common signal control schemes, namely, adaptive signal timing, fixed signal timing, and signal actuation. The benefits are presented in terms of delay improvement when common actuation protocols are used in conjunction with the H-AIM protocol. In contrast to previous reports, the results presented in this paper suggest that mixtures of turning movement assignments that are more permissive for CAVs and less permissive for human operated vehicles are often detrimental in terms of traffic delay. Nonetheless, when implemented on top of an actuated and adaptive controller, the extended H-AIM protocol is shown to never be detrimental while presenting statistically significant reductions in total delay when more than 15% of the traffic is composed of CAVs.

AB To assess the operational risk of multi-vehicle interactions for connected and au-tonomous vehicles (CAVs) in the weaving area, this study defines the 'multi-vehicle interaction risk potential field' based on the similarity between vehicle risk and potential field, on the basis of which the risk potential field between the interactive CAVs and ego CAV is determined. Then, a real-time risk assessment model of CAVs in the weaving area is developed, and a surrogate safety measure R of the CAVs' operational risk is proposed. Subsequently, the kinematic data of CAVs are obtained by simulation. Furthermore, the genetic algorithm is used to calibrate the parameters of the real-time risk assessment model. The validity of the model is demonstrated by comparing the R value and traffic conflict indicator (TTCi) for the car-following and cut-in behaviour in the weaving area scenario. The validation results of typical cases show that the variation ranges of R in the car-following and cut-in scenarios are 2.2 and 1.9 times those of TTCi, respectively, which can more effectively denote the operational risk of CAVs during multi-vehicle interactions in weaving area. The study can be used to provide reference for CAVs' driving decisions in weaving areas and promote their safety in multi-vehicle interaction scenarios.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes a novel robust event-triggered fault tolerant automatic steering control strategy for autonomous land vehicles to achieve path tracking and vehicle lateral motion control under in-vehicle network delay. From the practical point of view, the parameter uncertainties, time delay, and actuator fault are simultaneously introduced to make the designed controller robust to more extensive and challenging driving conditions. A novel polytope reduction and norm-bounded uncertainty reduction method is used to effectively handle the time-varying velocity and tire cornering stiffness uncertainties. Then, the uncertain vehicle model can be reconstructed as an uncertain network control system model with time delay and actuator fault. Due to the inevitable time delay and actuator fault, a new cubic absolute-value Lyapunov function is developed to guarantee the asymptotical stability of the closed control system with the H infinity performance, and the modified project-based adaptive law is applied to strengthen the fault tolerant ability. Furthermore, a progressive event-triggered mechanism is proposed for the collaborative design of robust fault tolerant automatic steering controller, which can signally improve the communication resource utilization of the limited bandwidth in-vehicle network. Finally, the performance comparisons of different controllers are presented. These results prove that the proposed controller can simultaneously guarantee the path tacking performance and lateral dynamics stability, and save the communication resource of the in-vehicle network.

AB This paper considers platoons with an arbitrary number of linear vehicles and derives conditions on the vehicle dynamics for ensuring time-headway spacing and for guaranteeing collision avoidance. It is shown that for reaching these control aims it is necessary and sufficient that the controlled vehicles are externally positive with respect to both the velocity and the distance output and have a quantified delay. The requirement on the platoon dynamics are transformed into four objectives for the vehicle controller design. Three control configurations are evaluated with respect to these objectives to find systematic design steps. Numerical examples illustrate the results.

AB Elucidation of power characteristics of an unmanned tracked vehicle for autonomous transportation of agricultural payloads in greenhouse constructions leads to appearance of an applied research in this study. This novel aim has been chosen based on operational requirement of the vehicle. Hence, it can be highlighted that this paper is initiative study described results of power efficiencies (motion, slip, and tractive power efficiencies) of the vehicle. To this aim, various payloads mounted on a trailer (1-5 kN) were towed by the vehicle through diverse drive speeds (0.17-0.5 m/s). Results illuminate that vehicle drive speed and payload weight had consequential contribution to vehicle motion and tractive power efficiencies. While, vehicle slip power efficiency mainly depended on payload weight. Linear regression approximations demonstrate that dual cumulative contributory effect of the drive speed and payload weight on the motion power efficiency (84.98-97.69 %) and tractive power efficiency (78.62-92.92 %) was antagonist and synergetic, respectively. Meanwhile, the slip power efficiency (81.71-98.36 %) linearly dropped with augmentation of payload weight. Resultant slip and motion power inefficiency were associate with vehicle motion power loss in amplitude of 0.39-67.98 and 2.65-14.03 W, respectively. Consequently, tractive power inefficiency was associate with vehicle motion power loss in amplitude of 3.15-82.01 W. This amplitude spotlights that 3.35-43.62 % of vehicle motion power inevitably wasted inside track-surface interface in agricultural towing tasks. Overall, numerical and analytical descriptions of the results as well as practical suggestions provide appropriate guidelines for vehicle supervisor in order to optimize power characteristics.CO 2023 ISTVS.

ID OBJECT DETECTION
AB A reliable obstacle detection system is crucial for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) to realize fully autonomous navigation with no need of human intervention. However, the current detection methods have particular drawbacks, such as poor detection for small objects, low estimation accuracy caused by water surface reflection, and a high rate of false-positive on water-sky interference. Therefore, we propose a new encoder-decoder structured deep semantic segmentation network, which is a water obstacle detection network based on image segmentation (WODIS), to solve the abovementioned problems. The first design feature of WODIS utilizes the use of an encoder network to extract high-level data based on different sampling rates. In order to improve obstacle detection at sea-sky line areas, an attention refine module (ARM) activated by both global average pooling and max pooling to capture high-level information has been designed and integrated into WODIS. In addition, a feature fusion module (FFM) is introduced to help concatenate the multidimensional high-level features in the decoder network. The WODIS is tested and cross-validated using four different types of maritime datasets with the results demonstrating that the mean intersection over union (mIoU) of WODIS can achieve superior segmentation effects for sea-level obstacles to values as high as 91.3%.

AB The safety of vulnerable road users is of paramount importance as transport moves towards fully automated driving. The richness of real-world data required for testing autonomous vehicles is limited and furthermore, available data do not present a fair representation of different scenarios and rare events. Before deploying autonomous vehicles publicly, their abilities must reach a safety threshold, not least with regards to vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians. In this paper, we present a novel Generative Adversarial Networks named the Ped-Cross GAN. Ped-Cross GAN is able to generate crossing sequences of pedestrians in the form of human pose sequences. The Ped-Cross GAN is trained with the Pedestrian Scenario dataset. The novel Pedestrian Scenario dataset, derived from existing datasets, enables training on richer pedestrian scenarios. We demonstrate an example of its use through training and testing the Ped-Cross GAN. The results show that the Ped-Cross GAN is able to generate new crossing scenarios that are of the same distribution from those contained in the Pedestrian Scenario dataset. Having a method with these capabilities is important for the future of transport, as it will allow for the adequate testing of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles on how they correctly perceive the intention of pedestrians crossing the street, ultimately leading to fewer pedestrian casualties on our roads.

AB Inspection of high-voltage power lines using unmanned aerial vehicles is an emerging technological alternative to traditional methods. In the Drones4Energy project, we work toward building an autonomous vision-based beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) power line inspection system. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based autonomous vision system to detect faults in power line components. We trained a YOLOv4-tiny architecture-based deep neural network, as it showed prominent results for detecting components with high accuracy. For running such deep learning models in a real-time environment, different single-board devices such as the Raspberry Pi 4, Nvidia Jetson Nano, Nvidia Jetson TX2, and Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier were used for the experimental evaluation. Our experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach can be effective and efficient for fully automatic real-time on-board visual power line inspection.

Notably, many underwater tasks, including the assessment of subsea infrastructure, are performed with the assistance of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). There have been recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, notably, Deep Learning (DL) models and applications, which have widespread usage in a variety of fields, including aerial unmanned vehicles, autonomous car navigation, and other applications. However, they are not as prevalent in underwater applications due to the difficulty of obtaining underwater datasets for a specific application. In this sense, the current study utilises recent advancements in the area of DL to construct a bespoke dataset generated from photographs of items captured in a laboratory environment. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were utilised to translate the laboratory object dataset into the underwater domain by combining the collected images with photographs containing the underwater environment. The findings demonstrated the feasibility of creating such a dataset, since the resulting images closely resembled the real underwater environment when compared with real-world underwater ship hull images. Therefore, the artificial datasets of the underwater environment can overcome the difficulties arising from the limited access to real-world underwater images and are used to enhance underwater operations through underwater object image classification and detection.

TI Editing Driver Character: Socially-Controllable Behavior Generation for
   Interactive Traffic Simulation
SO IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS

AB Traffic simulation plays a crucial role in evaluating and improving autonomous driving planning systems. After being deployed on public roads, autonomous vehicles need to interact with human road participants with different social preferences (e.g., selfish or courteous human drivers). To ensure that autonomous vehicles take safe and efficient maneuvers in different interactive traffic scenarios, we should be able to evaluate autonomous vehicles against reactive agents with different social characteristics in the simulation environment. We propose a socially-controllable behavior generation (SCBG) model for this purpose, which allows the users to specify the level of courtesy of the generated trajectory while ensuring realistic and human-like trajectory generation through learning from real-world driving data. Specifically, we define a novel and differentiable measure to quantify the level of courtesy of driving behavior, leveraging marginal and conditional behavior prediction models trained from real-world driving data. The proposed courtesy measure allows us to auto-label the courtesy levels of trajectories from real-world driving data and conveniently train an SCBG model generating trajectories based on the input courtesy values. We examine SCBG on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and show that we are able to control the SCBG model to generate realistic driving behaviors with desired courtesy levels. In particular, we find that SCBG is able to identify different motion patterns of courteous behaviors according to the scenarios.

AB Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have greatly improved the object detection capabilities of autonomous vehicles, especially using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, achieving high levels of accuracy and speed simultaneously in vehicular environments remains a challenge. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid approach that incorporates the features of two state-of-the-art object detection models: You Only Look Once (YOLO) and Faster Region CNN (Faster R-CNN). The proposed hybrid approach combines the detection and boundary box selection capabilities of YOLO with the region of interest (RoI) pooling from Faster R-CNN, resulting in improved segmentation and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we skip the Region Proposal Network (RPN) from the Faster R-CNN architecture to optimize processing time. The hybrid model is trained on a local dataset of 10,000 labeled traffic images collected during driving scenarios, further enhancing its accuracy. The results demonstrate that our proposed hybrid approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, providing both high accuracy and practical real-time object detection for autonomous vehicles. It is observed that the proposed hybrid model achieves a significant increase in accuracy, with improvements ranging from 5 to 7 percent compared to the standalone YOLO models. The findings of this research have practical implications for the integration of AI technologies in autonomous driving systems.

AB New Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) applications will increase air traffic densities in metropolitan regions. Collision avoidance systems (CAS) are a key component in integrating a high number of UAS into the airspace in a safe way. This paper presents a distributed, autonomous, and knowledge-based CAS, called Dronetology System (DroS), for UASs. The CAS proposed here is managed using a novel ontology, called Dronetology-cas, which allows to make autonomous decisions according to the knowledge inferred from the data gathered by the UAS.DroS is deployed as part of the payload of the UAS. So, it is designed to run in an embedded platform with limited processing capacity and low battery consumption. DroS collects data from sensors and collaborative elements to make smart decisions using knowledge obtained from collaborative UASs, adapting the maneuvers of the aerial vehicles to their original flight plans, their kind of vehicle, and the collision scenario. DroS accountability involves recording its internal operation to assist with reconstructing the circumstances surrounding an autonomous maneuver or the details previous to a collision. DroS has been verified using the hardware in the loop (HIL) technique with a UAS traffic environment simulator. Results obtained show a significant improvement in terms of safety by avoiding collisions.

AB ChatGPT, a chatbot launched by OpenAI, is making waves across the internet recently. Its potential capabilities and how it can impact various industries have been widely discussed. In the field of smart vehicles, integrating human-machine interaction systems with ChatGPT can be a game changer. For example, Jidu Auto, the electric vehicle arm of Baidu, announced in February 2023 that they will integrate ERNIE Bot (Sun et al., 2021), Baidu's ChatGPT-like service, into their cars. While ChatGPT has boosted the development of intelligent interaction, some limitations still exist that hinder its practical application. In this article, we discuss its potential applications in intelligent vehicles and analyze the challenges it faces.

AB Model predictive control (MPC) using randomized optimization is expected to solve different control problems. However, it still faces various challenges for real-world applications. This paper attempts to solve those challenges and demonstrates a successful implementation of randomized MPC on the autonomous driving using a radio-controlled (RC) car. First of all, a sample generation technique in the frequency domain is discussed. This prevents undesirable randomness which affect the smoothness of the steering operation. Second, the proposed randomized MPC is implemented on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). The expected GPU acceleration in calculation speed at various problem sizes is also presented. The results show the improved control performance and computational speed that was not achievable using CPU based implementation. Besides, the selection of parameters for randomized MPC is discussed. The usefulness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by both simulation and experiments. In the experiments, a 1/10 model RC car is used for collision avoidance task by autonomous driving.

AB The development of an autonomous jellyfish removal robot system, named JEROS, and related experimental results are presented in this paper. The number of jellyfish has drastically increased due to changes to the marine environment. Large jellyfish swarms are threatening marine ecosystems and inducing enormous damage globally to marine-related industries. JEROS has been designed based on a twin hull-type surface vehicle equipped with a device for shredding jellyfish. Additionally, an electrical control system, a guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) system, and a vision-based jellyfish detection system are embedded to remove jellyfish autonomously. The jellyfish removal mission starts when the location of jellyfish is detected, followed by planning a path for jellyfish removal, tracking the path using an autonomous navigation system, and shredding jellyfish while tracking. The performance of the vision-based jellyfish detection, navigation, and jellyfish removal was demonstrated through experiments in a pond and field tests in Masan Bay located on the southern coast of South Korea.

AB This paper demonstrates the weakness of GNSS/INS-RTK (GIR) systems in mapping challenging environments because of obstruction and deflection of satellite signals. Thus, it emphasizes that the strategy of mapping companies to commercially provide maps using expensive GIR systems does not always work robustly. This limits the scalability of autonomous vehicle deployment in many road structures and modern cities. Accordingly, different critical environments in Tokyo have been analyzed and investigated to demonstrate the effects of the road structure complexity on the GIR map quality with highlighting the relevant reasons. Therefore, this paper is intended to be a reference to prove that the data of GIR systems cannot always be considered as ground truth and the integration of SLAM technologies into the mapping modules is very necessary to enable the levels four and five of autonomous driving.

AB Unmanned vehicles have already proved invaluable in environmental field studies by providing levels of spatial-temporal sampling resolution which could have not been attained before. Recent trends show that the levels of spatial-temporal sampling resolutions attained with individual vehicles are feasible for wide areas through the operation of persistent vehicle networks. The possibility of persistent sampling over wide areas has the potential to revolutionize environmental field studies. The roles of unmanned vehicle systems in future environmental field studies are discussed in the light of the recent technological developments and trends, along with the major challenges associated to this vision. The discussion is illustrated with examples of developments from the Underwater Systems and Technologies Laboratory from Porto University, Portugal.

AB Understanding the mental process of public acceptance of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is important to the prediction and change of adoption behavior. We present a conceptual model to incorporate background factors such as demographic variables and travel behaviors attributes to the understanding of AV perceived usefulness and intention to adopt AVs. Using data from the 2019 California Vehicle Survey (CVS), we investigate the relationships between observed and latent variables with regard to AV acceptance via structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques. The results show that perceived usefulness is an important determinant of behavioral intention. Householders who are young, well-educated, and males perceive higher usefulness of AVs than other population segments. Households that have telecommuters, transit riders, transportation network company (TNC; e.g., Uber & Lyft) riders, and electric vehicles (EVs) owners, and households that own or plan to install photovoltaic cell (solar) panels also anticipate high benefits of AVs. Living or working at places with access to infrastructure such as EV charging stations and hydrogen fueling stations also add to positive perception of AVs' advantages. Controlling for perceived usefulness, households having higher annual income and EVs express a stronger interest in buying an AV but not in ridesharing. Young educated households with more TNC riders show a greater propensity to AV sharing services but not for owning AVs. The proposed conceptual model can help pinpoint how background factors such as socioeconomic status affects behavioral intention via its antecedent cognitive construct more accurately to represent the mental process of intention formation. The practical discoveries can assist policymakers identifying population segments that will be the first adopters of this technology.

AB More than ever, the automotive industry is shifting towards electric vehicles since environmental and sustainability concerns are becoming important to potential customers. Nowadays, automakers are also integrating connectedness and autonomous components in their produced vehicles to reduce time of travel and increase the safety of the drivers, passengers, vehicles and the whole transportation system. The popularity of Connected and Autonomous Electric Vehicles (CAEVs) led to a growing interest in their development with a careful focus on performance and quality aspects. In modern terms, Quality of Experience (QoE) covers important system, context, and human influencing factors that can drive improvements in the field. A rigorous survey of the literature revealed that QoE influencing factors and performance indicators are neither thoroughly identified, classified, nor modeled in an embracing framework that can be embedded in applications. In addition, QoE investigations are usually focused on specific CAEV subsystems and a broad addressing is practically non-existing. In this paper, the literature is explored for important performance aspects of CAEVs. Recent advances are critically appraised, challenges and gaps are identified, and improvements are carefully proposed. To this end, a thorough taxonomy is developed for QoE in CAEVs with a rich set of quality indicators and a framework that facilitates the integration of QoE concepts in system development. The presented contributions are expected to guide, enable, support, and accelerate future developments in the field. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, with the assistance of 5G networks and the Internet of Things, specialized applications of autonomous driving to mining sites have been explored, with the goal of realizing the unmanned operation of mining systems and enhancing the safety of the mining industry. After receiving the loading task, the autonomous driving system will generate a feasible trajectory for the mining truck. It requires that the trajectory be generated in advanced within a limited-time high-latency network. In addition, the secure trajectory planning for mining sites involves factors in the complex environment and an unstable network. Thus, a secure trajectory planning method for autonomous trucks at mining sites is proposed. It simplifies the planning by decoupling the planning into front-end path searching and back-end trajectory generation. First, the planner enhances the Hybrid A* search algorithm to find the hauling path within the boundary of the mining site, and then, it post-processes the path with a well-designed symmetric optimization-based method. Then, considering the interaction with other autonomous trucks, a topology-guided search method for secure decision making is proposed, considering the possibility of cybersecurity. The proposed method was validated in real scenarios of the mining environment. The results verify that the planner can generate the secure trajectory under network delay 2.0 s conditions.

AB Autonomous vehicles integrate complex software stacks for realizing the necessary iterative perception, planning, and action operations. One of the foundational layers of such stacks is the perception one which is comprised of localization, detection, and recognition algorithms for understanding the location and the driving environment around the vehicle. More precisely, localization aims to identify the location of the vehicle on a global coordinate system and is considered one of the most critical parts in the stack since its accuracy and robustness affects the subsequent algorithms of the perception layer and also the following planning and action layers. Due to the rapid and significant interest in self-driving cars, several localization techniques have been proposed with different directions and approaches. Algorithms using prior maps are currently considered the most accurate ones and found almost in all current self-driving car prototypes. Thus, in this paper, we categorize, discuss and analyze the state-of-the-art map-based localization techniques in an attempt to examine their potentials and limitations. We first present techniques and approaches that aim to match prior maps with on-board observations from different sensor modalities. We then review methods that handle the localization problem as a probabilistic one and finally, we also go through the emerging domain of deep-learning localization algorithms and examine their potential in self-driving cars. For all three categories, we provide comparison tables and necessary insights for the optimal localization system design based on different requirements, specifications, and sensor configurations.

AB Electronic control units (ECUs) connected by a controller area network (CAN) are used to perform various functions in modern vehicles. In the latest autonomous vehicles, redundant ECUs and a backup bus (different from CAN) are always equipped to prevent a single point of failure or network attack. However, due to the lack of protection measures of CAN bus, attackers can remotely intrude into the vehicle. Many schemes have proposed to use encryption to solve the security problem of CAN bus. Considering the current ECU storage space is limited, it is impossible to store all ECUs' keys. When a single point of failure or network attack against an ECU occurs, it is necessary for the backup ECU to process the messages related to the failed ECU. How to ensure that the backup ECU can decrypt the encrypted messages and at the same time securely isolates the backbone network from the backup network is an urgent issue to be solved. In order to solve the problem of forwarding and processing such messages under encryption conditions, we propose an efficient re-encryption scheme based on proxy re-encryption. The scheme is also suitable for cross-bus communication without backup networks. Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic, random oracle model and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool are utilized to prove that the scheme is secure. The scheme is simulated based on the MIRACL cryptography library on the computer and Raspberry Pi. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is secure compared with the existing scheme.

AB Autonomous mobile vehicles need advanced systems to determine their exact position in a certain coordinate system. For this purpose, the GPS and the vision system are the most often used. These systems have some disadvantages, for example, the GPS signal is unavailable in rooms and may be inaccurate, while the vision system is strongly dependent on the intensity of the recorded light. This paper assumes that the primary system for determining the position of the vehicle is wheel odometry joined with an IMU (Internal Measurement Unit) sensor, which task is to calculate all changes in the robot orientations, such as yaw rate. However, using only the results coming from the wheels system provides additive measurement error, which is most often the result of the wheels slippage and the IMU sensor drift. In the presented work, this error is reduced by using a vision system that constantly measures vehicle distances to markers located in its space. Additionally, the paper describes the fusion of signals from the vision system and the wheels odometry. Studies related to the positioning accuracy of the vehicle with both the vision system turned on and off are presented. The laboratory averaged positioning accuracy result was reduced from 0.32 m to 0.13 m, with ensuring that the vehicle wheels did not experience slippage. The paper also describes the performance of the system during a real track driven, where the assumption was not to use the GPS geolocation system. In this case, the vision system assisted in the vehicle positioning and an accuracy of 0.2 m was achieved at the control points.

AB Curb detection and localization systems constitute an important aspect of environmental recognition systems of autonomous driving vehicles. This is because detecting curbs can provide information about the boundary of a road, which can be used as a safety system to prevent unexpected intrusions into pedestrian walkways. Moreover, curb detection and localization systems enable the autonomous vehicle to recognize the surrounding environment and the lane in which the vehicle is driving. Most existing curb detection and localization systems use multichannel light detection and ranging (lidar) as a primary sensor. However, although lidar demonstrates high performance, it is too expensive to be used for commercial vehicles. In this paper, we use ultrasonic sensors to implement a practical, low-cost curb detection and localization system. To compensate for the relatively lower performance of ultrasonic sensors as compared to other higher-cost sensors, we used multiple ultrasonic sensors and applied a series of novel processing algorithms that overcome the limitations of a single ultrasonic sensor and conventional algorithms. The proposed algorithms consisted of a ground reflection elimination filter, a measurement reliability calculation, and distance estimation algorithms corresponding to the reliability of the obtained measurements. The performance of the proposed processing algorithms was demonstrated by a field test under four representative curb scenarios. The availability of reliable distance estimates from the proposed methods with three ultrasonic sensors was significantly higher than that from the other methods, e.g., 92.08% vs. 66.34%, when the test vehicle passed a trapezoidal-shaped road shoulder. When four ultrasonic sensors were used, 96.04% availability and 13.50 cm accuracy (root mean square error) were achieved.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have been introduced into the traffic stream alongside traditional vehicles (TVs) with the expectation of improved transportation safety, efficiency, and reliability. The majority of AV safety research has been done through simulation. The results of such research on the safety performances of AVs are heavily influenced by the methodological framework, algorithms, and assumptions about AV driving characteristics in a simulated environment. There is a need for AV safety research based on real-world settings before any wide-scale deployment of this technology.
   This paper investigates the impact of the presence of SAE level 2 AVs in the traffic stream in reducing longitudinal traffic conflicts using Surrogate Safety Measures on a real-world open-source database of mixed traffic trajectories. The analysis is conducted for both AV-exclusive and mixed AV-TV platoons. Furthermore, we explore whether the presence of AVs decreases longitudinal traffic conflicts in two-vehicle platoons comprising AV and TV mixed leaders and followers.
   We find that an exclusive AV platoon behaves similarly to an exclusive TV platoon and produces similar longitudinal conflicts. However, mixed platoons with both AVs and TVs result in a higher number of longitudinal conflicts. Maintaining near-identical leader-follower conditions, we find that the number of conflicts in mixed platoons when an AV follows a TV is higher than when a TV follows an AV. The increase in conflict numbers in a TV-AV mixed platoon can be attributed to AV's longer response time lag. In summary, analyses conducted in this paper indicate that exclusive platoons and pairs of vehicles exhibit fewer longitudinal conflicts than mixed platoons and pairs.

AB Nowadays, autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) are increasingly popular due to low resource consumption, low pollutant emission, and high efficiency. In practice, Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) networks supply energy power to EVs to ensure the usage of EVs. However, there are still certain security and privacy concerns in V2G connections, such as identity impersonation and message manipulation. Additionally, the widespread usage of EVs brings significant pressure on the power grid, leading to undesirable effects like voltage deviations if EVs' charging is not well coordinated. In this article, to tackle these issues, we design a novel load-balanced secure and private EV charging framework named load-balanced secure and private framework (LbSP) for secure, private, and efficient EV charging with a minimal negative effect on the existing power grid. It assures reliable and efficient charging services by a lightweighted encryption technique. Also, it balances the energy consumption of power grids via an online pricing strategy that minimizes load variance by optimizing energy prices in real time. Moreover, it preserves users' privacy while not affecting online pricing using an advanced differential privacy technique. Furthermore, LbSP deploys on an edge-cloud structure for fast response and more precise pricing, where clouds balance overall load consumption by online price optimization while edges gather data for clouds and respond to charging requests from EVs. The evaluation results show that the proposed framework ensures secure and private EV charging, balances energy load consumption, and preserves users' privacy.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have a number of potential advantages, although some research indicates that this technology may increase dependence on private cars. An alternative approach to bringing such technology to market is through autonomous taxis (ATs) and buses, which can assist in making transportation more sustainable. This paper aims at examining the role of attitudinal, travel-related, and individual factors in preferences for a modal shift from conventional cars toward ATs and exclusive-lane autonomous buses (ELABs), exploring the existence of heterogeneity and its possible sources. The proposed mixed logit model with a decomposition of random coefficients uses 1251 valid responses from a stated preference survey distributed in Tehran, in 2019. Results show that there is significant taste variation among individuals with respect to ATs' travel costs, ELABs' travel times, and walking distances to ELAB stations. Furthermore, exploring the sources of heterogeneity indicates that women are more sensitive to ATs' travel costs and walking distances to ELAB stations while they are less sensitive to ELABs' travel times. Moreover, travel time in discretionary activities reduces the utility of ELABs more than it does in mandatory activities. Transportation authorities can use these findings to establish more effective policies for the successful implementation of AVs.

AB Ride-sourcing platforms often face imbalances in the demand and supply of rides across areas in their operating road-networks. As such, dynamic pricing methods have been used to mediate these demand asymmetries through surge price multipliers, thus incentivising higher driver participation in the market. However, the anticipated commercialisation of autonomous vehicles could transform the current ride-sourcing platforms to fleet operators. The absence of human drivers fosters the need for empty vehicle management to address any vehicle supply deficiencies. Proactive redistribution using integer programming and demand predictive models have been proposed in research to address this problem. A shortcoming of existing models, however, is that they ignore the market structure and underlying customer choice behaviour. As such, current models do not capture the real value of redistribution. To resolve this, we formulate the vehicle redistribution problem as a non-linear minimum cost flow problem which accounts for the relationship of supply and demand of rides, by assuming a customer discrete choice model and a market structure. We demonstrate that this model can have a convex domain, and we introduce an edge splitting algorithm to solve a transformed convex minimum cost flow problem for vehicle redistribution. By testing our model using simulation, we show that our redistribution algorithm can decrease wait times by more than 50%, increase profit up to 10% with less than 20% increase in vehicle mileage. Our findings outline that the value of redistribution is contingent on localised market structure and customer behaviour.

TI What Types of Cars Will We Be Driving? Methods of Forecasting Car Travel

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

ID MODEL
AB New technologies are emerging in the private vehicle market. Conventional propulsion systems are set to be replaced by alternative, more environment-friendly ones (e.g., electric vehicles), and certain new features, like autonomous driving, will possibly change the way private cars are employed. To assess the impact of such technologies, one must estimate how often and for which trips these vehicle types will be used. Another issue is the exact localization of certain vehicle types on the network, to assess environmental effects and identify where specific roadside infrastructure (e.g., charging stations) will be required. This paper presents four approaches to forecasting car usage by vehicle type using a macroscopic travel demand model in combination with a vehicle fleet or technology diffusion model. Integrating the two types of models requires tools ranging from assumptions and extrapolation of empirical data to synthetic or incremental discrete choice models. The approaches are employed in a case study forecasting travel demand using privately owned autonomous vehicles (AVs) in Germany in 2030. Despite identical input data, the estimated proportion of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) using AVs varies between 11% and 23% of overall car VMT, depending on the approach chosen. The reasons for this variation in results are investigated and some recommendations are given. To avoid the difficulties of fitting a synthetic model to observed data and to increase the accuracy of the results, the recommendation is to formulate the vehicle type choice as an incremental model added to the travel demand model.

AB Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to revolutionize road transportation in terms of safety and efficiency, offering important societal, economic, and environmental benefits. In this work, we harness CAV capabilities, such as seamless connectivity and fine-grained control to safely and efficiently coordinate a set of CAVs crossing an unsignalized intersection. Coordinated control is achieved by generating an acceleration profile for each CAV to simultaneously optimize fuel consumption and travel time. As the resulting problem is non-convex and challenging to solve, we design a novel centralized solution approach. First, we construct a relaxed reformulation of the problem by ignoring certain safety constraints to eliminate interdependence between the trajectories of CAVs traveling in the same lane. Because the relaxed problem is still non-convex, we develop a custom convex-concave procedure that yields the travel time of each CAV to traverse the intersection without lateral collisions. Finally, the derived travel times are utilized to construct collision-free trajectories for all CAVs using convex optimization. Elaborating on principles from the centralized approach, we also introduce a decentralized scheme that solves the problem on a vehicle-by-vehicle basis. Extensive simulation results substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed solution approaches in terms of solution quality and execution speed. Simulation results also highlight the importance of optimizing the trade-off between travel time and fuel consumption as small sacrifices in travel time lead to substantial fuel savings. Finally, simulation results indicate that the simultaneous coordination of a set of CAVs yields significant performance benefits compared to decentralized control.

AB Autonomous driving has become a prominent topic with the rise of intelligent urban vision in communities. Advancements in automated driving technology play a significant role in the intelligent transportation system. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely heavily on sensor technologies as they are responsible for navigating safely through their environment and avoiding obstacles. This paper aims to outline the vital role of sensor fusion in intelligent transportation systems. Sensor fusion is the process of combining data from multiple sensors to obtain more comprehensive measurements and greater cognitive abilities than a single sensor could achieve. By merging data from different sensors, it ensures that driving decisions are based on reliable data, with improved accuracy, reliability, and robustness in AVs. This paper provides a comprehensive review of AV capacity, impacts, planning, technological challenges, and omitted concerns. We used state-of-the-art evaluation tools to check the performance of different sensor fusion algorithms in AVs. This paper will help us to determine our position, direction, the impacts of AVs on society, the need for smart city mobility outcomes, and the way to solve the auto industry challenges in the future. The analysis of AV systems from the perspective of sensor fusion in this research is expected to be beneficial to current and future researchers.

AB The development of the future's smart cities will increasingly depend on autonomous vehicles. For example, object detection, tracking, path planning, and sentiment or intent recognition, among other things, have all been the subject of several suggestions in recent years in an effort to address specific components of the working pipeline and develop a useful end-to-end system. This article presents a simple benchmark to evaluate the performance of object identification algorithms under deteriorating image quality. In this article, the input image is taken from the car object detection dataset, then, it gets preprocessed. The preprocessing involved Histogram equalization-based contrast enhancement, geometric transformations, and image augmentation. After getting preprocessed the region of interest is segmented with the help of a mask convolutional recurrent neural network (MCRNN). Then, the segmented region is classified using the long short-term memory (LSTM) with the self-improved chimp optimization algorithm. Object detection is performed through the proposed model called MCRNN-SICLSTM. The implementation is performed using MATLAB software. The performance of the proposed model is compared with the existing techniques using the performance metrics accuracy, precision, recall, F-Measure, mean absolute error, mean square error, false positive rate, false negative rate. The accuracy achieved is 99.23%.

AB Background: The growth of the number of vehicles in traffic has led to an exponential increase in the number of road accidents with many negative consequences, such as loss of lives and pollution. Methods: This article focuses on using a new technology in automotive electronics by equipping a semi-autonomous vehicle with a complex sensor structure that is able to provide centralized information regarding the physiological signals (Electro encephalogram-EEG, electrocardiogram-ECG) of the driver/passengers and their location along with indoor temperature changes, employing the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Thus, transforming the vehicle into a mobile sensor connected to the internet will help highlight and create a new perspective on the cognitive and physiological conditions of passengers, which is useful for specific applications, such as health management and a more effective intervention in case of road accidents. These sensor structures mounted in vehicles will allow for a higher detection rate of potential dangers in real time. The approach uses detection, recording, and transmission of relevant health information in the event of an incident as support for e-Call or other emergency services, including telemedicine. Results: The novelty of the research is based on the design of specialized non-invasive sensors for the acquisition of EEG and ECG signals installed in the headrest and backrest of car seats, on the algorithms used for data analysis and fusion, but also on the implementation of an IoT temperature measurement system in several points that simultaneously uses sensors based on MEMS technology. The solution can also be integrated with an e-Call system for telemedicine emergency assistance. Conclusion: The research presents both positive and negative results of field experiments, with possible further developments. In this context, the solution has been developed based on state-of-the-art technical devices, methods, and technologies for monitoring vital functions of the driver/passengers (degree of fatigue, cognitive state, heart rate, blood pressure). The purpose is to reduce the risk of accidents for semi-autonomous vehicles and to also monitor the condition of passengers in the case of autonomous vehicles for providing first aid in a timely manner. Reported abnormal values of vital parameters (critical situations) will allow interveneing in a timely manner, saving the patient's life, with the support of the e-Call system.

ID EDGE INTELLIGENCE
AB Autonomous vehicles rely on sensors such as cameras and Lidar to collect data to make safe driving decisions. However, the sensors of a single-vehicle may be blocked or interfered with, and then the insufficient perception limits the safety of autonomous driving. Cooperative perception is to expand the perception domain of a single vehicle by sharing the perception data. Cooperative perception based on V2V (Vehicle to Vehicle) broadcast communication mode still might transmit a large amount of redundant data. Based on C-V2V (Cellular Vehicle to Vehicle) mmWave communication, fortunately, the edge server interconnected with the 5G small cell base station provides the possibility of centralized processing to leverage the perception interactive features among vehicles to carry on effective cooperative perception scheming. In this paper, a method based on deep reinforcement learning is designed to make centralized decisions to optimize the synergy of cooperative perception. In a highway scene, the road is firstly partitioned into several regions. As for each region, the interactive perception features of local vehicles and the regional perception features are obtained by an embedding method. Subsequently, according to the embedded features, the deep Q-learning network generates a perception combination of multiple vehicles to improve the perception synergy. Compared with the baselines, our proposed method improves the perception synergy. The experiment results show that our trained model has generalization ability and the end-to-end delay is under the constraint of safety critical applications.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

ID CHANNEL
AB A novel Single-shot Multi-scale detection network with feature fusion and multi-scale attention mechanism is proposed for autonomous driving. The proposed model is referred to as a Single-shot Multi-scale Attentive Detector (SSAD) and it would build feature relations of the feature map in the spatial space. The proposed network highlights pedestrian and vehicle regions on the extracted feature map and also suppresses irrelevant regions, from the global relation information and thereby providing reliable guidance for autonomous driving, while detecting smaller and occluded targets. SSAD design is simple, accurate and computationally efficient. Evaluation results of the proposed network on multiple datasets have achieved considerable and promising results. Experimental results show that the SSAD network when tested on Pascal Voc-2007, INRIA, Caltech, and City Persons datasets, outperforms many state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors.

AB Drowsiness is among the important factors that cause traffic accidents; therefore, a monitoring system is necessary to detect the state of a driver's drowsiness. Driver monitoring systems usually detect three types of information: biometric information, vehicle behavior, and driver's graphic information. This review summarizes the research and development trends of drowsiness detection systems based on various methods. Drowsiness detection methods based on the three types of information are discussed. A prospect for arousal level detection and estimation technology for autonomous driving is also presented. In the case of autonomous driving levels 4 and 5, where the driver is not the primary driving agent, the technology will not be used to detect and estimate wakefulness for accident prevention; rather, it can be used to ensure that the driver has enough sleep to arrive comfortably at the destination.

AB Fully-autonomous vehicles, both aerial and ground, could provide great benefits in the Agriculture 4.0 framework when operating within cooperative architectures, thanks to their ability to tackle difficult tasks, particularly within complex irregular and unstructured scenarios such as vineyards on sloped terrains. A decentralised multi-phase approach has been proposed as an alternative to more common cooperative schemes. When perennial crops are considered, it is advantageous to build a simplified geometrical (and georefer-enced) crops model, which can be identified by using 3D point clouds acquired during a -priori explorative missions by unmanned aerial vehicles. This model can be used to plan the tasks to be performed within the crops by the in-field aerial and ground drones. In this companion paper, the proposed strategy is applied to a specific case study involving a vineyard on a sloped terrain, located in the Barolo region in Piedmont, Italy. Ad-hoc technologies and guidance, navigation and control algorithms were designed and imple-mented. The main objectives were to improve the autonomous driving capabilities of the drones involved and to automate the process of retrieving low-complexity maps from the data collected with preliminary remote sensing missions to make them available for the autonomous navigation by a quadrotor and an unmanned 4-wheel steering ground vehicle within the vine rows. Preliminary results highlight the benefits achievable by exploiting the tailored technologies selected and applied to improve each of the analysed mission phases. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

ID INDUSTRIAL INTERNET
AB In this paper, we present a three-byte-based Media Access Control (MAC) protocol to resolve the mutual authentication problem in an Autonomous Internet of Vehicles (AIoV) network. Initially, the network architecture is divided into two chains, i.e. the local and public chain, wherein the local chain the authentication and communication process is controlled by Cluster head (CH), while in the public chain it is controlled by the base station (BS). The proposed paradigm uses the 48-bit MAC address of the vehicle's embedded sensors for authentication, with the ability to alter the authentication parameters by triggering the last three bytes (24 bits) of the MAC address with a predetermined time interval. Persistent triggering of the last three bytes of an AIoV's MAC address guarantees its integrity in the network because only legal vehicles are capable of initiating and validating the authentication request with the other vehicles in the network. Initially, the MAC addresses of all AIoVs are registered with the BS in the public chain through the concerned CH. Likewise, the MAC-address triggering of registered AIoVs is carried out in the BS with a defined time period and broadcasted in the public chain, which is further distributed through CHs in the local chain. Most of the computation is supervised by BS and CH in the public and local chains respectively, which minimize the client-side authentication complexity and enhances network efficiency in terms of authentication with 983% detection rate, communications, and computing costs, along with 11% improvement in the latency, 15% improvement in packet lass ratio (PLR), and throughput.

   companies (TNCs); Ridehailing; Vehicle miles traveled
AB The popularity of Uber and Lyft and advances in autonomous vehicle technology have spurred public interest in the potential of shared ride services to reduce traffic congestion, vehicle emissions and space devoted to parking. However, research has shown that long waiting times, circuitous routes and privacy concerns might lead most patrons to choose exclusive-ride services over shared services (ride-hail or autonomous), thus increasing rather than decreasing vehicle mileage.
   This paper uses Uber and Lyft experience from 2014 to 2020 to examine the effectiveness of shared (or "pooled") services in reducing vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in four cities with large concentrations of ride-hail trips and suburban areas of California. Taking into account three key inputs - pooling rates, modal shifts and deadhead miles - results show that pre-pandemic levels of pooling led to at least a doubling of VMT when comparing ride-hail trips with patrons' previous mode, with increases of 97% in Chicago, 114% in New York City, 118% in San Francisco, 157% in Boston and 118% in California suburbs.
   These large VMT increases are driven by the addition of dead-head miles before each pick-up and the absence of offsetting VMT reductions among travelers who switch to ride-hail from public transportation, biking and walking. VMT increases are only modestly mitigated by the use of ride-hail for "first mile/last mile" trips to connect to public transportation or by reduced cruising for parking by drivers in their personal vehicles.
   In sum, ride-hail adds to vehicle mileage for trips associated with ride-hail even taking into account pooling. This pattern is likely to endure in a world of autonomous vehicles given that auto users tend to switch to solo services due to considerations of travel time, reliability, comfort and privacy, while pooled options mainly draw patrons from sustainable modes like public transportation. The implication for public policy is that in dense urban areas, it remains important for policy-makers to prioritize space-efficient modes of public transportation, walking and biking. At the same time, ride-hail can clearly be valuable to meet specific needs such as providing paratransit services to people with disabilities, providing first and last mile connections to transit services and connecting late-night workers to jobs.
   These results will be important as cities emerge from the coronavirus pandemic and navigate a path to economic recovery, social equity, and environmental sustainability.

TI Approaching autonomous driving with cautious optimism: analysis of road
   traffic injuries involving autonomous vehicles based on field test data
SO INJURY PREVENTION
LA English

AB Objectives
   To examine the patterns and associated factors of road traffic injuries (RTIs) involving autonomous vehicles (AVs) and to discuss the public health implications and challenges of autonomous driving.
   Methods
   Data were extracted from the reports of traffic crashes involving AVs. All the reports were submitted to the California Department of Motor Vehicles by manufacturers with permission to operate AV test on public roads. Descriptive analysis and chi(2) analysis or Fisher's exact test was conducted to describe the injury patterns and to examine the influencing factors of injury outcomes, respectively. Binary logistic regression using the Wald test was employed to calculate the OR, adjusted OR (AOR) and 95% CIs. A two-tailed probability (p<0.05) was adopted to indicate statistical significance.
   Results
   133 reports documented 24 individuals injured in 19 crashes involving AVs, with the overestimated incidence rate of 18.05 per 100 crashes. 70.83% of the injured were AV occupants, replacing vulnerable road users as the leading victims. Head and neck were the most commonly injured locations. Driving in poor lighting was at greater risk of RTIs (AOR 6.37, 95% CI 1.47 to 27.54). Collisions with vulnerable road users or incidents happening during commute periods led to a greater number of victims (p<0.05). Autonomous mode cannot perform better than conventional mode in road traffic safety to date (p=0.468).
   Conclusions
   Poor lighting improvement and the regulation of commute-period traffic and vulnerable road users should be strengthened for AV-related road safety. So far AVs have not demonstrated the potential to dramatically reduce RTIs. Cautious optimism about AVs is more advisable, and multifaceted efforts, including legislation, smarter roads, and knowledge dissemination campaigns, are fairly required to accelerate the development and acceptance.

AB In this paper, a novel technique is presented to test the flight of an unmanned aerial vehicle autonomously in a real-world scenario using a data-driven technique without intervening with its onboard software. With the growing applications of such vehicles, testing of autonomous flight is a very important task for rapid deployment. There are different tools for modeling and simulating unmanned vehicles in virtual worlds such as Gazebo, MATLAB, Simulink, and Webots to name a few. None of these simulation tools are able to model all possible physical parameters of a real-world environment. Hence, the flight controller or mission planning software has to be tested in the physical world in the presence of an expert before deployment for a specific task. A Perception Inference Engine evaluation tool is presented that can infer internal states of the autonomous system from external observations only. The Gazebo simulation platform is used to collect data to develop the perception model. For real-time data collection, a VICON motion capture system is used to observe the autonomous flight of a small unmanned aerial vehicle. A state-of-the-art decision tree algorithm is used to implement the data-driven approach. The technique was tested using simulation data and verified with real-time data from Intel Aero Ready to Fly and Parrot AR. 2.0 drones. Moreover, we analyzed the robustness of the proposed system by introducing noise in sensor measurement and ambiguity in the testing scenario. We compared the performance of the decision tree classifier with Naive bayes and support vector machine classifiers. It is shown that the developed system can be used for the performance evaluation of a UAV operating in the physical world by significantly reducing uncertainty in mission failure due to environmental parameters.

AB As an important stage in the development of autonomous driving, mixed traffic conditions, consisting of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), have attracted more and more attention. In fact, the randomness of human-driven vehicles (HDV) is the largest challenge for connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) to make reasonable decisions, especially in lane change scenarios. In this paper, we propose the problem of lane change decisions for CAV in low visibility and mixed traffic conditions for the first time. First, we consider the randomness of HDV in this environment and construct a finite state machine (FSM) model. Then, this study develops a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) for describing the problem of lane change. In addition, we use the modified deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) to solve the problem and get the optimal lane change decision in this environment. The reward designing takes the comfort, safety and efficiency of the vehicle into account, and the introduction of transfer learning accelerates the adaptation of CAV to the randomness of HDV. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted. The results show that, compared with the original DDPG, the modified DDPG has a faster convergence velocity. The strategy learned by the modified DDPG can complete the lane change in most of the scenarios. The comparison between the modified DDPG and the rule-based decisions indicates that the modified DDPG has a stronger adaptability to this special environment and can grasp more lane change opportunities.

AB Emerging connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technologies provide an opportunity to the vehicle motion control to improve the traffic performance. This study simulated and evaluated the CAV-based speed and lane-changing (LC) control strategies at the expressway work zone in heterogeneous traffic flow. The control strategies of CAV are optimized by the multi-layer control structure based on model predictive control. The heterogeneous traffic flow composed of human-driven vehicles and CAVs is constructed based on cellular automata by the proposed Expected Distance-based Symmetric Two-lane Cellular Automate (ED-STCA) LC model and CAV car-following model. The six control strategies composed of variable speed limits (VSL), LC and their coordinated control strategies are experimented. The average travel time and throughput are selected to assess the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy under each combination of vehicles' arrival rates and CAV mixed ratios. The numerical results show that: (i) the effect of the control strategy on the traffic is not obvious under free flow, and the control strategy may worsen the traffic under medium traffic. (ii) Early lane-changing control (ELC) is better than late lane-changing control (LLC) under medium traffic, and LLC is better under heavy traffic. (iii) ELC+VSL is the best choice under heavy traffic and the mixed rate of CAVs is high. The simulation results obtained in the paper would provide some practical references for transportation agencies to manage the traffic in work zone under networking environment in the future.

AB The Autonomous Truck Mounted Attenuator (ATMA) vehicle system is a technology that leverages connected and automated vehicle (CAV) capabilities for maintenance of transportation infrastructure. Promoted by FHWA and state departments of transportation (DOTs), it is a niche CAV application in leader-follower style, intended to remove DOT workers from the following maintenance truck, to reduce fatalities in work zones. Because practicable guidance for deployment of this technology is largely missing in MUTCD, state DOTs have been making their own deployment criteria. In this manuscript, we focus on the operational design domain (ODD) problem-under what traffic conditions should ATMA be deployed. Modeling efforts are first focused on the derivation of an effective discharge rate that can be associated with a moving bottleneck caused by slow-moving ATMA vehicles on a multilane highway. Then, based on the demand input and discharge rates, microscopic traffic flow models calculate vehicle delay and density, which the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) suggests are key indicators of a multilane highway's level of service (LOS). In this way, the linkage between AADT and LOS is analytically established. NGSIM data is used for the model validation and shows that the developed model correctly captures the effective discharge rate discount caused by moving bottlenecks. The modeling results demonstrate that roadway performance is sensitive to the K factor and D factor, as well as the operating speed of ATMA and, if LOS = C is a desirable design objective, a good AADT threshold to use would be around 40,000 vehicles per day.

AB With the rapid evolution in wireless communications and autonomous vehicles, intelligent and autonomous vehicles will be launched soon. Vehicle to Everything (V2X) communications provides driving safety, traffic efficiency, and road information in real-time in vehicular networks. V2X has evolved by integrating cellular 5G and New Radio (NR) access technology in V2X communications (i.e., 5G NR V2X); it can fulfill the ever-evolving vehicular application, communication, and service demands of connected vehicles, such as ultra-low latency, ultra-high bandwidth, ultra-high reliability, and security. However, with the increasing number of intelligent and autonomous vehicles and their safety requirements, there is a backlash in deployment and management because of scalability, poor security and less flexibility. Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) plays a significant role in bringing cloud services closer to vehicular nodes, which reduces the scalability and flexibility issues. In addition, blockchain has evolved as an effective technology enabler to solve several security, privacy, and networking issues faced by the current 5G-based MEC systems in vehicular networks. Blockchain can be integrated as a strong security mechanism for securing and managing 5G V2X along with MEC. In this survey, we discuss, in detail, state-of-the-art V2X, its evolution based on cellular 5G technology and non-cellular 802.11bd. We investigate the integration of blockchain in 5G-based MEC vehicular networks for security, privacy protection, and content caching. We present the issues and challenges in existing edge computing and 5G V2X and, then, we shed some light on future research directions in these integrated and emerging technologies.

AB This work addresses the problem of localizing a ground target observed by multiple heterogeneous unmanned vehicles. Specifically, the case of a team of unmanned aerial and ground vehicles is analyzed. Effective collaboration between unmanned aerial and ground vehicles can utilize the strengths of both platforms while mediating their individual weaknesses. In this research, a probabilistic framework is proposed to improve target localization accuracy by utilizing the epipolar geometry and inter-robot localization measurements. A virtual simulation environment is implemented to fully test the proposed methods. Hardware experiments are carried out to validate the proposed methods.

AB Cooperative control for rail vehicles is a new idea which builds on existing models and methods developed in the context of flight formation and autonomous ground vehicles. The underlying idea is to assimilate virtually coupled rail vehicles to arrays of mass-spring-dashpot systems. The contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, a novel scheme is proposed which involves a supervisory control for the higher-level planning and a local motion coordination for the lower-level implementation. For the supervisory control, a review of the existing scheduling models and methods based on alternate graphs and a mixed-integer (non)linear program is conducted. For the local coordination, a nonlinear and uncertain model is developed and a constructive method is provided to design a feedback control that stabilizes the vehicle around a desired equilibrium point, in terms of position and velocity. Second, the control design method is extended to the case of multiple virtually coupled vehicles. It is proven that the transient dynamics follows a typical synchronization dynamics. It is also proven that under such control, the whole system of rail vehicles converges to a pre-defined equilibrium point, characterized by a specific velocity and relative distance between vehicles. Conditions for the stability of such equilibrium points are investigated. Third, under the hypothesis of homogeneity, bounds on the damping coefficient for the synchronization equilibrium (in terms of velocity and relative distance between vehicles) to be overdamped or underdamped are provided.

AB Vertical takeoff and vertical landing (VTVL) vehicles, based on throttling liquid rocket engines, are attracting increasing attention for their validation of guidance and control techniques during landing. However, validation requires the vehicle to fly in a special trajectory with multiple constraints. Propellant consumption should be carefully calculated for the purpose of carrying more experimental devices during the flight, which makes conducting minimum-propellant trajectory optimization a necessity. This study focuses on the optimization of VTVL vehicles based on a throttling liquid rocket engine. Three flight scenarios applicable to this vehicle are proposed, namely, VTVL vehicles without horizontal movement, VTVL vehicles with horizontal movement, and vertical takeoff and autonomous landing with horizontal movement. Trajectory optimization using the Gauss pseudospectral method (GPM) was conducted during the abovementioned flight scenarios. The results show that the GPM provides excellent solutions for trajectory optimization in the different scenarios. In VTVL vehicles with horizontal movement, vertical takeoff, and autonomous landing with horizontal movement scenarios, the thrust appears in a similar bang-bang control. Meanwhile, in VTVL vehicles without a horizontal movement scenario, the thrust appears like a segmented bang-bang control, which we call regulative bang-bang control. Moreover, by introducing the thrust derivative into the optimization objective using a weighted method, thrust fluctuation can be restrained. To ensure the compatibility of switching the flight among the three scenarios, the carried propellant mass should be decided based on the third flight scenario.

AB In the context of reaching the best way to control the movement of autonomous cars linearly and angularly, making them more stable and balanced on different roads and ensuring that they avoid road obstacles, this manuscript chiefly aims to reach the optimal approach for a fractional-order PID controller (or (PID?)-D-?-controller) instead of the already classical one used to provide smooth automatic parking for electrical autonomous cars. The fractional-order (PID?)-D-?-controller is based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for its design, with two different approximations: Oustaloup's approximation and the continued fractional expansion (CFE) approximation. Our approaches to the fractional-order PID using the results of the PSO algorithm are compared with the classical PID that was designed using the results of the Cohen-Coon, Ziegler-Nichols and bacteria foraging algorithms. The scheme represented by the proposed (PID?)-D-?-controller can provide the system of the autonomous vehicle with more stable results than that of the PID controller.

AB The advances in autonomous technologies and microelectronics have increased the use of Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in more critical applications, such as forest fire monitoring and fighting. In addition, implementing surveillance methods that provide rich information about the fires is considered a great tool for Emergency Response Teams (ERT). From this aspect and in collaboration with Telefonica Digital Espana, Dronitec S.L, and Divisek Systems, this paper presents a fire monitoring system based on perception algorithms, implemented on a UAV, to perform surveillance tasks allowing the monitoring of a specific area, in which several algorithms have been implemented to perform the tasks of autonomous take-off/landing, trajectory planning, and fire monitoring. This UAV is equipped with RGB and thermal cameras, temperature sensors, and communication modules in order to provide full information about the fire and the UAV itself, sending these data to the ground station in real time. The presented work is validated by performing several flights in a real environment, and the obtained results show the efficiency and the robustness of the proposed system, against different weather conditions.

AB Currently, studies on autonomous driving are being actively conducted. Vehicle positioning techniques are very important in the autonomous driving area. Currently, the global positioning system (GPS) is the most widely used technology for vehicle positioning. Although technologies such as the inertial navigation system and vision are used in combination with GPS to enhance precision, there is a limitation in measuring the lane and position in shaded areas of GPS, like tunnels. To solve such problems, this paper presents the use of LED lighting for position estimation in GPS shadow areas. This paper presents simulations in the environment of three-lane tunnels with LEDs of different color temperatures, and the results show that position estimation is possible by the analyzing chromaticity of LED lights. To improve the precision of positioning, a fuzzy logic system is added to the location function in the literature [1]. The experimental results showed that the average error was 0.0619 cm, and verify that the performance of developed position estimation system is viable compared with previous works.

AB The problem considered in this paper involves the design of a vision-based autopilot for small and micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed autopilot is based on an optic flow-based vision system for autonomous localization and scene mapping, and a nonlinear control system for flight control and guidance. This paper focusses on the development of a real-time 3D vision algorithm for estimating optic flow, aircraft self-motion and depth map, using a low-resolution onboard camera and a low-cost Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Our implementation is based on 3 Nested Kalman Filters (3NKF) and results in an efficient and robust estimation process. The vision and control algorithms have been implemented on a quadrotor UAV, and demonstrated in real-time flight tests. Experimental results show that the proposed vision-based autopilot enabled a small rotorcraft to achieve fully-autonomous flight using information extracted from optic flow. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB The in-vehicle controller area network (CAN) bus is one of the essential components for autonomous vehicles, and its safety will be one of the greatest challenges in the field of intelligent vehicles in the future. In this paper, we propose a novel system that uses a deep neural network (DNN) to detect anomalous CAN bus messages. We treat anomaly detection as a cross-domain modelling problem, in which three CAN bus data packets as a group are directly imported into the DNN architecture for parallel training with shared weights. After that, three data packets are represented as three independent feature vectors, which corresponds to three different types of data sequences, namely anchor, positive and negative. The proposed DNN architecture is an embedded triplet loss network that optimizes the distance between the anchor example and the positive example, makes it smaller than the distance between the anchor example and the negative example, and realizes the similarity calculation of samples, which were originally used in face detection. Compared to traditional anomaly detection methods, the proposed method to learn the parameters with shared-weight could improve detection efficiency and detection accuracy. The whole detection system is composed of the front-end and the back-end, which correspond to deep network and triplet loss network, respectively, and are trainable in an end-to-end fashion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technology can make real-time responses to anomalies and attacks to the CAN bus, and significantly improve the detection ratio. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first used for anomaly detection in the in-vehicle CAN bus.

AB The progress achieved in transportation systems and artificial intelligence has amplified the use of intelligent transportation systems and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). Indeed, AV systems have attracted much research in recent years, which enabled multiple autonomous driving tasks, including scene understanding, visual prediction, decision-making, and communication. The latter may create a bottleneck in low-resource autonomous driving systems that send the collected images to remote edge servers for processing and decision-making. Such an issue can be addressed by compressing the images in the AV and ensuring a good-quality reconstruction at the edge. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network for Compressed Sensing (CS) based image reconstruction that integrates image semantic perception to improve the reconstruction process for visual prediction tasks. The reconstruction process is optimized using a perception-inspired loss in an end-to-end model learning process. The trained model is evaluated on autonomous driving car datasets. Obtained experimental results outperform state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both image reconstruction quality and processing time. Finally, we perform semantic urban scene segmentation on the reconstructed image to evaluate reconstruction quality for visual task prediction.

AB The self-adaptive traffic signal control system serves as an effective measure for relieving urban traffic congestion. The system is capable of adjusting the signal timing parameters in real time according to the seasonal changes and short-term fluctuation of traffic demand, resulting in improvement of the efficiency of traffic operation on urban road networks. The development of information technologies on computing science, autonomous driving, vehicle-to-vehicle, and mobile Internet has created a sufficient abundance of acquisition means for traffic data. Great improvements for data acquisition include the increase of available amount of holographic data, available data types, and accuracy. The article investigates the development of commonly used self-adaptive signal control systems in the world, their technical characteristics, the current research status of self-adaptive control methods, and the signal control methods for heterogeneous traffic flow composed of connected vehicles and autonomous vehicles. Finally, the article concluded that signal control based on multiagent reinforcement learning is a kind of closed-loop feedback adaptive control method, which outperforms many counterparts in terms of real-time characteristic, accuracy, and self-learning and therefore will be an important research focus of control method in future due to the property of "model-free" and "self-learning" that well accommodates the abundance of traffic information data. Besides, it will also provide an entry point and technical support for the development of Vehicle-to-X systems, Internet of vehicles, and autonomous driving industries. Therefore, the related achievements of the adaptive control system for the future traffic environment have extremely broad application prospects.

AB As a bio-inspired and emerging sensor, an event-based neuromorphic vision sensor has a different working principle compared to the standard frame-based cameras, which leads to promising properties of low energy consumption, low latency, high dynamic range (HDR), and high temporal resolution. It poses a paradigm shift to sense and perceive the environment by capturing local pixel-level light intensity changes and producing asynchronous event streams. Advanced technologies for the visual sensing system of autonomous vehicles from standard computer vision to event-based neuromorphic vision have been developed. In this tutorial-like article, a comprehensive review of the emerging technology is given. First, the course of the development of the neuromorphic vision sensor that is derived from the understanding of biological retina is introduced. The signal processing techniques for event noise processing and event data representation are then discussed. Next, the signal processing algorithms and applications for event-based neuromorphic vision in autonomous driving and various assistance systems are reviewed. Finally, challenges and future research directions are pointed out. It is expected that this article will serve as a starting point for new researchers and engineers in the autonomous driving field and provide a bird's-eye view to both neuromorphic vision and autonomous driving research communities.

AB Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) have been widely studied in the recent literature. Agent-based simulations and theoretical models have extensively explored the effects on travel service, fleet size, and congestion using heuristic dispatching strategies to match SAVs with on-demand passengers. A major question that simulations have sought to address is the service rate or replacement rate: the number of passengers each SAV can serve. Thus far, the service rate has mostly been estimated through simulation. This paper investigates an analytical max-pressure dispatch policy, which aims to maximize passenger throughput under any stochastic demand pattern, which takes the form of a model predictive control algorithm. An analytical proof using Lyapunov drift techniques is presented to show that the dispatch policy achieves maximum stability. The service rate and minimum fleet sizes are derived analytically in this paper and can be achieved with the proposed dispatch policy. Simulation results show that the maximum stable demand is linearly related to the fleet size given. Also, it demonstrates how asymmetric demand necessitates rebalancing trips that affect service rates. Even though decreasing average waiting time is not the primary goal of this paper, stability ensures bounded waiting times, which is demonstrated in simulation.

AB The literature suggests that autonomous vehicles (AVs) may drastically change the user experience of private automobile travel by allowing users to engage in productive or relaxing activities while travelling. As a consequence, the generalised cost of car travel may decrease, and car users may become less sensitive to travel time. By facilitating private motorised mobility, AVs may eventually impact land use and households' residential location choices. This paper seeks to advance the understanding of the potential impacts of AVs on travel behaviour and land use by investigating stated preferences for combinations of residential locations and travel options for the commute in the context of autonomous automobile travel. Our analysis draws from a stated preference survey, which was completed by 512 commuters from the Sydney metropolitan area in Australia and provides insights into travel time valuations in a long-term decision-making context. For the analysis of the stated choice data, mixed logit models are estimated. Based on the empirical results, no changes in the valuation of travel time due to the advent of AVs should be expected. However, given the hypothetical nature of the stated preference survey, the results may be affected by methodological limitations.

AB A growing interest in ocean exploration for scientific and commercial research has been shown, mainly due to the technological developments for maritime and offshore industries. The use of Autonomous surface vehicles (ASV) have a promising role to revolutionize the transportation, monitorization, operation and maintenance areas, allowing to perform distinct task from offshore assets inspection to harbor patrolling. This work presents SENSE, an autonomouS vEssel for multi-domaiN inSpection and maintEnance. It provides an open-source hardware and software architecture that is easy to replicate for both research institutes and industry. This is a multi-purpose vehicle capable of acquiring multi-domain data for inspecting and reconstructing maritime infrastructures. SENSE provides a research platform which can increase the situational awareness capabilities for ASVs. SENSE full configuration provides multimodal sensory data acquired from both domains using a Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), a stereoscopic camera, and a multibeam echosounder. In addition, it supplies navigation information obtained from a real-time kinematic satellite navigation system and inertial measurement units. Moreover, the tests performed at the harbor of Marina de Leca, at Porto, Portugal, resulted in a dataset which captures a fully operational harbor. It illustrates several conditions on maritime scenarios, such as undocking and docking examples, crossings with other vehicles and distinct types of moored vessels. The data available represents both domains of the maritime scenario, being the first public dataset acquired for multi-domain observation using a single vehicle. This paper also provides examples of applications for navigation and inspection on multi-domain scenarios, such as odometry estimation, bathymetric surveying and multi-domain mapping.

AB Effective communication in vehicular networks depends on the scheduling of wireless channel resources. There are two types of channel resource scheduling in Release 14 of the 3GPP, i.e., (1) controlled by eNodeB and (2) a distributed scheduling carried out by every vehicle, known as Autonomous Resource Selection (ARS). The most suitable resource scheduling for vehicle safety applications is the ARS mechanism. ARS includes (a) counter selection (i.e., specifying the number of subsequent transmissions) and (b) resource reselection (specifying the reuse of the same resource after counter expiry). ARS is a decentralized approach for resource selection. Therefore, resource collisions can occur during the initial selection, where multiple vehicles might select the same resource, hence resulting in packet loss. ARS is not adaptive towards vehicle density and employs a uniform random selection probability approach for counter selection and reselection. As a result, it can prevent some vehicles from transmitting in a congested vehicular network. To this end, the paper presents Truly Autonomous Resource Selection (TARS) for vehicular networks. TARS considers resource allocation as a problem of locally detecting the selected resources at neighbor vehicles to avoid resource collisions. The paper also models the behavior of counter selection and resource block reselection on resource collisions using the Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC). Observation of the model is used to propose a fair policy of counter selection and resource reselection in ARS. The simulation of the proposed TARS mechanism showed better performance in terms of resource collision probability and the packet delivery ratio when compared with the LTE Mode 4 standard and with a competing approach proposed by Jianhua He et al.

AB With the development of artificial intelligence technology, various sectors of industry have developed. Among them, the autonomous vehicle industry has developed considerably, and research on self-driving control systems using artificial intelligence has been extensively conducted. Studies on the use of image-based deep learning to monitor autonomous driving systems have recently been performed. In this paper, we propose an advanced control for a serving robot. A serving robot acts as an autonomous line-follower vehicle that can detect and follow the line drawn on the floor and move in specified directions. The robot should be able to follow the trajectory with speed control. Two controllers were used simultaneously to achieve this. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used for target tracking and trajectory prediction, and a proportional-integral-derivative controller is designed for automatic steering and speed control. This study makes use of a Raspberry PI, which is responsible for controlling the robot car and performing inference using CNN, based on its current image input.

AB Autonomous shipboard launching of UAVs in a hostile atmospheric environment would greatly extend the usefulness of these aircraft, Currently a majority of UAVs are remotely launched under limited conditions. This paper presents control and guidance strategies that will allow autonomous launching under a much greater set of atmospheric hazards. Two modern control techniques are compared for use in this case. The main problem when dealing with low speed UAVs is found to be high steady winds causing stall. Several strategies are presented that can allow stall to be avoided and recovered.

AB The prospect of driverless cars wide-scale deployment is imminent owing to the advances in robotics, computational power, communications, and sensor technologies. This promises highway fatality reductions and improvements in traffic and fuel efficiency. Our understanding of the effects arising from commuting in autonomous cars is still limited. The novel concept of the loss of driver controllability is introduced here. It requires a reassessment of vehicle's comfort criteria. In this review paper, traditional comfort measures are examined and autonomous passenger awareness factors are proposed. We categorize path-planning methods in light of the offered factors. The objective of the review presented in this article is to highlight the gap in path planning from a passenger comfort perspective and propose some research solutions. It is expected that this investigation will generate more research interest and bring innovative solutions into this field.

AB This paper develops a nonparametric controller with an internal model control (IMC) structure for the longitudinal speed tracking control of autonomous land vehicles by designing a proportional and internal model control (IMC) cascade (P-IMC) controller. An IMC architecture is employed in the inner control loop by establishing a nonparametric longitudinal dynamical model, whereas a P controller is designed for the outer control loop. An approach for estimating the terrain effects and compensating for the model errors is also introduced. The differences from other nonparametric controllers are discussed, and the stability of the P-IMC controller is analyzed and validated experimentally. The P-IMC controller is compared with the SpAM+PI to illustrate its advantages. The experimental results of autonomous all-terrain driving show the effectiveness of the P-IMC controller.

AB Autonomous intersection management (AIM) (which coordinates intersection movements to avoid signal phases) and dynamic lane reversal (DLR) (which frequently changes lane directions in response to time-varying demand) have previously been proposed for connected autonomous vehicles. A major open question for both is finding the optimal control policy. This paper develops a decentralized max-pressure policy that controls both AIM and DLR based on queue lengths on adjacent links. Using a stochastic queueing model, we prove that the max-pressure policy is also throughput-optimal; any demand that can be stabilized (queue lengths remain bounded) will be stabilized by the max-pressure policy. We show numerically that DLR significantly increases the stability region, particularly for asymmetric demand. Since the stochastic queueing model excludes some realistic aspects of traffic flow, we adapt the max-pressure control for simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment. Results on a city network show significant improvements from max-pressure AIM with and without DLR.

AB Despite the many advancements in traffic safety, vehicle overtaking still poses significant challenges to both human drivers and autonomous vehicles, especially, how to evaluate the safety of passing a leading vehicle efficiently and reliably on a two-lane road. However, few realistic attempts in this field have been made in the literature to provide practical solutions without prior knowledge of the state of the environment and simplifications of vehicle models. These model simplifications make many of the proposed solutions in the literature unusable in real scenarios. Considering the dangers that can arise from performing a defective overtake and the substantial risk of vehicle crashes during high-speed maneuvers, in this paper we propose a system based on model predictive control to accurately estimate the safety of starting a vehicle overtake in addition to vehicle control during the maneuver that aims to ensure a collision-free overtake using a complete and realistic model of the vehicle's dynamics. The system relies on a stereoscopic vision approach and machine learning techniques (YOLO and DeepSORT) to gather information about the environment such as lane width, lane center, and distance from neighboring vehicles. Furthermore, we propose a set of scenarios to test the performance of the proposed system based on accurate modeling of the environment under a range of traffic conditions and road architecture. The simulation result shows the high performance of the proposed system in ending collisions during overtaking and providing optimal pathing that minimizes travel time.

AB In autonomous transportation, the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup-delivery and time windows (VRPSPDTW) plays a crucial role in enhancing transportation efficiency, thereby garnering significant research attention over the past decade. However, due to the increased complexity of VRPSPDTW, traditional heuristic algorithms have been inadequate in solving this problem. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a multitask-based evolutionary algorithm (MBEA) with knowledge transfer designed specifically for solving VRPSPDTW in autonomous transportation. MBEA tackles large-scale VRPSPDTW instances by utilizing multiple auxiliary tasks to aid the optimization process. Initially, MBEA generates k different auxiliary tasks by randomly selecting a subset of customers from the original VRPSPDTW. Subsequently, an evolutionary multitasking approach is employed to generate offspring solutions. This enables the transfer of valuable routing information among tasks, facilitating the evolutionary search for the original VRPSPDTW. Experimental studies conducted on a practical test suite of large-scale VRPSPDTW instances validate the superiority of our proposed algorithm over several recently proposed approaches. Note to Practitioners-The vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup-delivery and time windows (VRPSPDTW) is prevalent in autonomous transportation and finds application in various industrial sectors. It arises when manufacturing companies need to collect scrap products from customers for recycling purposes or deliver purchased commodities within specified time windows. However, traditional optimization methods face challenges in effectively addressing these problems due to their large-scale requirements and the necessity to provide satisfactory service. Thus, this paper proposes a multitask-based evolutionary algorithm with knowledge transfer that aims to obtain optimal solutions for VRPSPDTW. Our algorithm utilizes multiple auxiliary tasks to facilitate the optimization process for the original large-scale VRPSPDTW. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in dealing with practical large-scale VRPSPDTW within a reasonable time frame.

AB Most recently, DC nanogrid incorporating effective energy management has attracted widespread attention. Due to its favorability to integrate renewable energy sources and emerging power electronic loads, such as photovoltaics and electric vehicles (EVs), DC nanogrid is believed to be able to improve the energy utilization efficiency and mitigate the carbon footprint in the coming decades. Towards a compact, cost-effective, and easy-to build energy management scheme for nanogrid, this paper presents a pseudo hierarchical management architecture built upon the smart charging point. The proposed architecture incorporates the upper-level central controller with the local power role creatively and comprises two timescale management levels with corresponding operation strategies. In the short-timescale local management level, a state-triggered droop strategy based on the decentralized control mechanism is introduced to realize the autonomous power coordination without extensive communication links. The autonomous vehicle-to-grid (V2G) operation is also implemented with providing real-time power balance capability to unpredicted and short-timescale load variation in peak periods. In the power dispatching level, a multi-mode power dispatching strategy involving six operation modes is introduced to realize the efficient power scheduling for the nanogrid. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture and operation strategy is verified in the detailed simulation model and hardware-in-loop experiment platform. The results show that the real-time, autonomous, and stabilized power coordination in nanogrid could be realized along with a self-regulated V2G operation. Additionally, the peak-shaving and valley-filling of load curve, the satisfaction of EV charging demand, and an improved operation economy are achieved under the proposed architecture and operation strategy.

AB Autonomous driving of higher automation levels asks for optimal execution of critical maneuvers in all environments. A crucial prerequisite for such optimal decision-making instances is accurate situation awareness of automated and connected vehicles. For this, vehicles rely on the sensory data captured from onboard sensors and information collected through V2X communication. The classical onboard sensors exhibit different capabilities and hence a heterogeneous set of sensors is required to create better situation awareness. Fusion of the sensory data from such a set of heterogeneous sensors poses critical challenges when it comes to creating an accurate environment context for effective decision-making in AVs. Hence this exclusive survey analyses the influence of mandatory factors like data pre-processing preferably data fusion along with situation awareness toward effective decision-making in the AVs. A wide range of recent and related articles are analyzed from various perceptive, to pick the major hiccups, which can be further addressed to focus on the goals of higher automation levels. A section of the solution sketch is provided that directs the readers to the potential research directions for achieving accurate contextual awareness. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is uniquely positioned for its scope, taxonomy, and future directions.

AB Reliability-based mission planning of off-road autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) aims to identify an optimal path under uncertain and deformable terrain environment, while satisfying specific mission mobility reliability (MMR) constraints. The repeated evaluation of MMR during path planning poses computational challenges for practical applications. This paper presents an efficient reliability-based mission planning using an outcrossing approach that has a similar computational complexity compared to deterministic mission planning. A Gaussian random field is employed to represent the spatially dependent uncertainty sources in the terrain environment. The latter are then used in conjunction with a vehicle mobility model to generate a stochastic mobility map. Based on the stochastic mobility map, outcrossing rate maps are generated using the outcrossing concept which is widely used in time-dependent reliability. Integration of the outcrossing rate map with a rapidly exploring random tree (RRT*) algorithm allows for efficient path planning of AGVs subject to MMR constraints. A reliable RRT* algorithm using the outcrossing approach (RRT*-OC) is developed to implement the proposed efficient reliability-based mission planning. Results of a case study with two scenarios verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

AB Lane changing systems have consistently received attention in the fields of vehicular communication and autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose a lane change system that combines deep reinforcement learning and vehicular communication. A host vehicle, trying to change lanes, receives the state information of the host vehicle and a remote vehicle that are both equipped with vehicular communication devices. A deep deterministic policy gradient learning algorithm in the host vehicle determines the high-level action of the host vehicle from the state information. The proposed system learns straight-line driving and collision avoidance actions without vehicle dynamics knowledge. Finally, we consider the update period for the state information from the host and remote vehicles.

DE autonomous vehicle; bathymetry; uncrewed surface vehicle; seafloor

AB Coastal shallow water environments (<5 m) are extremely biodiverse and dynamic yet are often mapped too infrequently or at too low resolutions to capture the important processes occurring in these regions. Common forms of coastal surveying can leave gaps in data in the shallow water zone due to optical instrument capabilities and a vessel's ability to navigate in this region. One solution to these issues is an autonomous hovercraft that can fly over land and water and begin surveying at sub-meter water depths, bridging the gap between common optical and acoustic surveying methods. The craft's autonomy is tested via four autonomous flight paths, or missions, and the desired path is compared to both the observed heading and direction of motion. Although the accuracy for each track in the mission varies, most headings and directions of motion of the hovercraft are within 50 degrees of the desired direction. A single-beam echo sounder was used to map the bathymetry of the study site, showing a gently sloping beach.

AB With the rise in popularity of autonomous driving, the speed and accuracy of surrounding objects' detection by in-vehicle sensing technology is becoming increasingly important for autonomous vehicles. Building on CenterNet, this paper proposes CenterNet-Auto, a new anchor-free detection network for driving scenes that can satisfy the detection speed requirements while ensuring detection accuracy. The network's backbone uses the RepVGG model transformed through structural re-parameterization technology. Features of different scales are fused, and feature pyramids and deformable convolution are added after the backbone to accurately detect objects of different sizes. To solve the occlusion problem in the driving scene, this paper proposes the Average Border Model, which supports locating the object using the boundary feature information. The test results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms CenterNet regarding speed and accuracy on the BDD dataset. The accuracy reaches 55.6%, and the speed reaches 30 FPS, meeting the speed and accuracy requirements in a driving scene.

SO JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE

ID ROBOTS
AB In this paper we propose a new method for generating test scenarios for black-box autonomous systems that demonstrate critical transitions in performance modes. This method provides a test engineer with key insights into the software's decision-making engine and how those decisions affect transitions between performance modes. We achieve this via adaptive, simulation-based testing of the autonomous system where each sample represents a simulated scenario. The test scenario, i.e the system input, represents a given configuration of environmental or mission parameters and the resulting outputs are the system's performance based on high-level success criteria. For realistic testing scenarios, the dimensionality of the configuration space and the computational expense of high-fidelity simulations precludes exhaustive or uniform sampling. Thus, we have developed specialized adaptive search algorithms designed to discover performance boundaries of the autonomy using a minimal number of samples. Further, unsupervised clustering techniques are presented that can group test scenarios by the resulting performance modes and sort them by those which are most effective at diagnosing changes in the autonomous system's behavior. The result is a testing framework that gives the test engineer a set of diverse scenarios that exercises the decision boundaries of the autonomous system under test. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles have gained increasing popularity. They are employed in many applications due to its features in terms of flexibility, low cost, and small size. Due to special structure of mechanical system for the quadrotor helicopter (typical small-sized unmanned aerial vehicle), one of the main research fields for quad-rotor helicopter is to improve its stability flight control so as to well implement its autonomous navigation. However, for the quad-rotor helicopter whose power is supplied by battery, the embedded operating system directly affects its flight performance; thus, it is of very importance to implement this goal. This article aims to put forward a high-performance software platform consisted of embedded operating system and JAVA virtual machine in the quad-rotor helicopter. Then, this article also proposes an autonomous control algorithm written by real-time JAVA application, which uses image entropy to avoid obstacles and optical flow to discover the most appropriate area to fly in while avoiding obstacles; besides, image identification with image contour detection is used for the cases of junction turn and landing. The practical experimental results show that the implemented software control platform and proposed autonomous flight application are component for indoor autonomous flight of quad-rotor helicopter.

AB Distributed autonomous situational awareness is one of the most important foundation for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm to implement various missions. Considering the application environment being usually characterized by strong confrontation, high dynamics, and deep uncertainty, the distributed situational awareness system based on UAV swarm needs to be driven by the mission requirements, while each node in the network can autonomously avoid collisions and perform detection mission through limited resource sharing as well as complementarity of respective advantages. By efficiently solving the problems of self-avoidance, autonomous flocking and splitting, joint estimation and control, etc., perception data from multi-platform multi-source should be extracted and fused reasonably, to generate refined, tailored target information and provide reliable support for decision-making.

AB A scalar magnetometer payload has been developed and integrated into a two-man portable autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for geophysical and archeological surveys. The compact system collects data from a Geometrics microfabricated atomic magnetometer, a total-field atomic magnetometer. Data from the sensor is both stored for post-processing and made available to an onboard autonomy engine for real-time sense and react behaviors. This system has been characterized both in controlled laboratory conditions and at sea to determine its performance limits. Methodologies for processing the magnetometer data to correct for interference and error introduced by the AUV platform were developed to improve sensing performance. When conducting seabed surveys, detection, and characterization of targets of interest are performed in real-time aboard the AUV. This system is used to drive both single- and multiple-vehicle autonomous target reacquisition behaviors. The combination of on-board target detection and autonomous reacquire capability is found to increase the effective survey coverage rate of the AUV-based magnetic sensing system.

AB In this paper an automated guided vehicle (AGV) for low payload is presented. By the use of low cost onboard sensors instead of expensive laser measurement devices the investment effort is reduced significantly. Ceiling cameras constantly track all static and moving obstacles. This information in combination with the vehicles local sensor data is leading to an optimized position estimations of both vehicles and obstacles.
   Every AGV is able to autonomously execute pending transportation tasks. That is why the presented indoor transportation solution provides a highly efficient way to realize an automated one-piece-flow concept in applications with varying environmental conditions. (C) 2012 CIRP.

AB Robot cooperation is key in Search and Rescue (SaR) tasks. Frequently, these tasks take place in complex scenarios affected by different types of disasters, so an aerial viewpoint is useful for autonomous navigation or human tele-operation. In such cases, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in cooperation with an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) can provide valuable insight into the area. To carry out its work successfully, such as multi-robot system requires the autonomous takeoff, tracking, and landing of the UAV on the moving UGV. Furthermore, it needs to be robust and capable of life-long operation. In this paper, we present an autonomous system that enables a UAV to take off autonomously from a moving landing platform, locate it using visual cues, follow it, and robustly land on it. The system relies on a finite state machine, which together with a novel re-localization module allows the system to operate robustly for extended periods of time and to recover from potential failed landing maneuvers. Two approaches for tracking and landing are developed, implemented, and tested. The first variant is based on a novel height-adaptive PID controller that uses the current position of the landing platform as the target. The second one combines this height-adaptive PID controller with a Kalman filter in order to predict the future positions of the platform and provide them as input to the PID controller. This facilitates tracking and, mainly, landing. Both the system as a whole and the re-localization module in particular have been tested extensively in a simulated environment (Gazebo). We also present a qualitative evaluation of the system on the real robotic platforms, demonstrating that our system can also be deployed on real robotic platforms. For the benefit of the community, we make our software open source.

AB Since few or no human operators are directly involved in the operation of an autonomous marine system (AMS), an online risk model is necessary to enhance the intelligence of the AMS, its situation awareness, and decision making. The current study combines the system-theoretic process analysis (STPA) with Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) to develop online risk models for an AMS. Furthermore, fuzzy discretization is introduced to deal with evidence uncertainty. The proposed risk model can update the risk level as the operating conditions change, providing a basis for AMS supervisory risk control (SRC). A two-level SRC is proposed in this study. Using the operation of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) under sea ice as an example, the current work presents an online risk model and a corresponding SRC system, focusing on the navigation hazards to the AUV and its potential loss. The results of simulation studies show that the model enables the AUV to be informed of the risk level and to make risk-based decisions accordingly, thereby improving its intelligence. The importance of the evidence uncertainty in online risk models and SRC is analyzed and discussed. The results and conclusions of this analysis can be adapted to other AMSs.

AB The vision-based vehicle detection in front of an ego-vehicle is regarded as promising for driver assistance as well as for autonomous vehicle guidance. The feasibility of vehicle detection in a passenger car requires accurate and robust sensing performance. A multivehicle detection system based on stereo vision has been developed for better accuracy and robustness. This system utilizes morphological filter, feature detector, template matching, and epipolar constraint techniques in order to detect the corresponding pairs of vehicles. After the initial detection, the system executes the tracking algorithm for the vehicles. The proposed system can detect front vehicles such as the leading vehicle and side-lane vehicles. The position parameters of the vehicles located in front are obtained based on the detection information. The proposed vehicle detection system is implemented on a passenger car, and its performance is verified experimentally. (C) 2009 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

AB Humans drive in a holistic fashion which entails, in particular, understanding dynamic road events and their evolution. Injecting these capabilities in autonomous vehicles can thus take situational awareness and decision making closer to human-level performance. To this purpose, we introduce the ROad event Awareness Dataset (ROAD) for Autonomous Driving, to our knowledge the first of its kind. ROAD is designed to test an autonomous vehicle's ability to detect road events, defined as triplets composed by an active agent, the action(s) it performs and the corresponding scene locations. ROAD comprises videos originally from the Oxford RobotCar Dataset, annotated with bounding boxes showing the location in the image plane of each road event. We benchmark various detection tasks, proposing as a baseline a new incremental algorithm for online road event awareness termed 3D-RetinaNet. We also report the performance on the ROAD tasks of Slowfast and YOLOv5 detectors, as well as that of the winners of the ICCV2021 ROAD challenge, which highlight the challenges faced by situation awareness in autonomous driving. ROAD is designed to allow scholars to investigate exciting tasks such as complex (road) activity detection, future event anticipation and continual learning. The dataset is available at https://github.com/gurkirt/road-dataset; the baseline can be found at https://github.com/gurkirt/3D-RetinaNet.

ID LANE; FRAMEWORK
AB Accurate perception, especially situational awareness, is central to the evolution of autonomous driving. This necessitates understanding both the traffic conditions and driving intentions of surrounding vehicles. Given the unobservable nature of driving intentions, the hidden Markov model (HMM) has emerged as a popular tool for intention recognition, owing to its ability to relate observable and hidden variables. However, HMM does not account for the inconsistencies present in time series data, which are crucial for intention recognition. Specifically, HMM overlooks the fact that recent observations offer more reliable insights into a vehicle's driving intention. To address the aforementioned limitations, we introduce a time-sequenced weights hidden Markov model (TSWHMM). This model amplifies the significance of recent observations in recognition by integrating a discount factor during the observation sequence probability computation, making it more aligned with practical requirements. Regarding the model's input, in addition to easily accessible states of a target vehicle, such as lateral speed and heading angle, we also introduced lane hazard factors that reflect collision risks to capture the traffic environment information surrounding the vehicle. Experiments on the HighD dataset show that TSWHMM achieves recognition accuracies of 94.9% and 93.4% for left and right lane changes, surpassing both HMM and recurrent neural networks (RNN). Moreover, TSWHMM recognizes lane-changing intentions earlier than its counterparts. In tests involving more complex roundabout scenarios, TSWHMM achieves an accuracy of 87.3% and can recognize vehicles' intentions to exit the roundabout 2.09 s in advance.

AB Autonomous mobility is one of the rapidly evolving aspects of smart transportation which carries the potential of reshaping both demand and supply sides of transportation systems. While understanding public opinions about autonomous vehicles (AVs) is a compelling step towards their successful implementation, still little is known about to which extent people will embrace this new technology and how the vehicle features will affect their adoption decision. This study presents a new approach for modeling the adoption behavior of fully AVs using the profile-case best-worst scaling model. In this approach, an AV profile which is characterized in terms of the main vehicle attributes and their associated levels is presented to the decision maker and he/she is asked to select the most and the least attractive attributes. Further, a binary adoption question at the end of the choice task inquires if the respondent is willing to purchase the described AV. Utilizing this method, we can recognize the difference between the intrinsic impacts of the vehicle attributes and the impact of the attribute levels on the adoption decision. Results of the analysis indicate that people are much more sensitive to the purchase price and incentive policies such as taking liability away from the "driver" in case of accidents and provision of exclusive lanes for AVs compared to other factors such as fuel efficiency, safety, or environmental friendliness. Further, it is found that millennials with higher income, those who live in the downtown area, and the majority of people who have experienced an accident in the past have greater interests in adopting this technology.

This new mathematical method is used to develop a sampling-based model predictive control algorithm. We apply this information-theoretic model predictive control scheme to the task of aggressive autonomous driving around a dirt test track, and compare its performance with a model predictive control version of the cross-entropy method.

AB News concerning autonomous cars are becoming more and more common today. There are recordings of vehicles in self-driving mode having an accident as well as footages in which they operate properly, in an errorless way. What can cause this fundamental difference? Either a software problem or the inaccuracy of the data emitted by the sensors or an incorrect decision issued by the central unit. This article is going to show the various ways in which the decisions of the central unit can be influenced and so the passengers and the environment of the vehicle can be endangered. The aim is not to affect the trade of the autonomous cars in a negative way but, on the contrary, to attract the attention of the manufacturers to make them get prepared for and protect their cars against these dangers. At the end of the article there are going to be some suggestions made on how to install a module that can recognize external manipulations in self-driving cars to make their operation more secure.

DE autonomous vehicles; scene understanding; occlusion reasoning; road
   detection
AB The deep convolutional neural network has led the trend of vision-based road detection, however, obtaining a full road area despite the occlusion from monocular vision remains challenging due to the dynamic scenes in autonomous driving. Inferring the occluded road area requires a comprehensive understanding of the geometry and the semantics of the visible scene. To this end, we create a small but effective dataset based on the KITTI dataset named KITTI-OFRS (KITTI-occlusion-free road segmentation) dataset and propose a lightweight and efficient, fully convolutional neural network called OFRSNet (occlusion-free road segmentation network) that learns to predict occluded portions of the road in the semantic domain by looking around foreground objects and visible road layout. In particular, the global context module is used to build up the down-sampling and joint context up-sampling block in our network, which promotes the performance of the network. Moreover, a spatially-weighted cross-entropy loss is designed to significantly increases the accuracy of this task. Extensive experiments on different datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and comparisons with current excellent methods show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline models by obtaining a better trade-off between accuracy and runtime, which makes our approach is able to be applied to autonomous vehicles in real-time.

AB In large-scale industrial applications, goods must be continuously transported between locations, which in the absence of conveyor systems is by a fleet of individual vehicles. This article introduces flow-achieving scheduling tree (FAST), an online dispatching algorithm that allows vehicles to efficiently operate as a team to maximize the system's throughput while meeting a production schedule. A high-performance model is developed for high-fidelity prediction of vehicle interactions and system performance. It is subsequently optimized using a self-tuning variant of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to make agile dispatch decisions in real time. The method is validated using an open-cut mine site and is shown to outperform a commonly used algorithm in this domain. Note to Practitioners-This article was motivated by the problem of dispatching autonomous haul trucks on open-cut mine sites. The proposed method is suited to any industrial transportation system where a continuous stream of goods must be efficiently transported between the load and unload stations by a potentially heterogeneous fleet of automated vehicles. The system makes decisions in real time while reacting to performance variations and disturbances by using a receding horizon approach. Off-the-shelf software commonly used in this domain is based on heuristics with limited ability to optimize, leading to myopic decision making without taking vehicle interactions into account. Here, flow-achieving scheduling tree (FAST) overcomes this by optimizing over possible schedules and thereby implicitly accounting for knock-on effects. Future work will incorporate additional constraints into the optimization process and validate FAST in other industrial domains.

   Dual-Rate State Estimation and Comparison of Different Real-Time Control

SO SENSORS
LA English
DT Article
DE autonomous vehicle; dual-rate control; dual-rate EKF; MPC; LPV model
AB In this contribution, we suggest two proposals to achieve fast, real-time lane-keeping control for Autonomous Ground Vehicles (AGVs). The goal of lane-keeping is to orient and keep the vehicle within a given reference path using the front wheel steering angle as the control action for a specific longitudinal velocity. While nonlinear models can describe the lateral dynamics of the vehicle in an accurate manner, they might lead to difficulties when computing some control laws such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) in real time. Therefore, our first proposal is to use a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) model to describe the AGV's lateral dynamics, as a trade-off between computational complexity and model accuracy. Additionally, AGV sensors typically work at different measurement acquisition frequencies so that Kalman Filters (KFs) are usually needed for sensor fusion. Our second proposal is to use a Dual-Rate Extended Kalman Filter (DREFKF) to alleviate the cost of updating the internal state of the filter. To check the validity of our proposals, an LPV model-based control strategy is compared in simulations over a circuit path to another reduced computational complexity control strategy, the Inverse Kinematic Bicycle model (IKIBI), in the presence of process and measurement Gaussian noise. The LPV-MPC controller is shown to provide a more accurate lane-keeping behavior than an IKIBI control strategy. Finally, it is seen that Dual-Rate Extended Kalman Filters (DREKFs) constitute an interesting tool for providing fast vehicle state estimation in an AGV lane-keeping application.

AB As cities implement intelligent systems and public transportation users seek flexibility, autonomous demand-responsive transport (ADRT) will play an important role in a region's broader public transportation system. We have seen this in cities where trials have been conducted. Great efforts and investments are being made in the industrial and academic sectors to make autonomous driving a reality. This study investigates the challenges and opportunities of adopting ADRT in South East Queensland, Australia. This is critical as ADRT can help be an alternative way to provide public transport, especially for first and last-mile service. The adapted methodology is an exploratory qualitative study through interviews with transport experts to provide comprehensive insights regarding the ADRT service concept, potential customer groups in terms of the supply and the demand side, potential use cases, followed by an explanation of the ADRT deployment and adoption challenges in terms of the supply side and the demand side. Accordingly, we offer recommendations mainly contributing to mindset change, education and exposure, subsidies and incentives, liability and insurance that can support policymakers, transport planners, and engineers in making effective policy choices and developing successful transportation systems, while also increasing public recognition and adoption of ADRT technology.

AB Digital twin (DT) technology is being applied increasingly in the Internet of Vehicles environment, but it still faces many challenges in terms of efficiency and security. In the field of DT-based autonomous driving, many previous works have been done to study the efficient migration methods of DT models. But these works consider the migration process as a blackbox. We study the efficient migration method of the DT model between the edge computing nodes inside the blackbox. We propose three different migration strategies depending on the source of the initial data and the source of the updated data, and evaluate the efficiency of these strategies in terms of migration time in different network environments using the autonomous driving simulation platform CARLA. We then derive methods for selecting migration strategies under different network conditions. During the migration process, there may be external attacks on participating elements or networks. We analyze the security problems that may arise during the migration process and propose corresponding defense methods against such cyberattacks.

AB Machine learning is widely used for autonomous driving because it can recognize surrounding circumstances feasibly from sensor and determine appropriate actions. Most of these sensors are based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), which enable autonomous vehicles to judge objects in conjunction with object-detection algorithms. However, recent studies have shown that MEMS are vulnerable to signal-injection attacks, in which the input images are manipulated to force the object detection algorithms to misclassify the results. These attacks can be critical in the wild because they deteriorate state-of-the-art detection techniques, dropping their detection rates until the objects would no longer be detected at all. In this paper, we propose Priest, a novel detection method against prior signal-injection attacks. Priest uses the similarity of pixel values between two consecutive images. Using only two images ensures a low computational cost. According to our performance analysis, Priest detects state-of-the-art signal-injection attacks in real-time with 99% accuracy on average, achieving practical autonomous driving security.

AB In this article, the autonomous driving problem in an unstructured scene is addressed using a model predictive control (MPC) scheme. The lack of scene structure makes the sensing problem challenging, in particular when considered within a control loop. To circumvent this difficulty, the bundle adjustment (BA) algorithm from computer vision is used to detect obstacles and compute a sparse representation of the environment. In one of the main results of this article, it is shown how this sparse representation can be cast as additional safety constraints to the MPC optimization. The MPC/BA combination is intuitively appealing since they both solve quadratic problems and also because the BA estimations trend to be more accurate when the resulting constraints become active in the MPC solver. This article contains a theoretical presentation of the control scheme and discusses implementation details. An example of the overall approach at work can be seen in https://youtu.be/aU46vpzDHso.

AB The routing of a fleet of autonomous and free ranging vehicles in in-house logistics is a complex task. Generally speaking, routing requires the determination of routes between sources and sinks (route planning) and rules to deal with detecting and solving routing conflicts between vehicles during operation (dynamic motion coordination) . This publication introduces a new, lane-based approach for routing of free ranging vehicles. It bases on the idea of an a-priori design of multiple lanes, whereas a single lane is defined as a static, unidirectional and plane connection between a specific start and destination point in the layout. The basic idea of the described lane concept is to achieve short travel distances and low probabilities of routing conflicts for a fleet of free ranging vehicles. Accordingly, this paper also presents an appropriate heuristic for lane design and discusses its benefits compared to an exact approach in the context of applicability for real world sized problems. Further, an application in a test case shows the advantages of the lane-based routing, such as a lower amount of routing conflicts, lower transportation times and therefore an overall higher transportation system performance compared to two benchmark strategies for routing.

AB This article concerns the open question of creating control policies of autonomous vehicles (AVs) that lead to courteous motion. The study is built on a two-agent interaction between two agents (Mand H), where each agent plans its motion by optimizing a trade-off of goal fulfillment, safety, and courtesy losses. The paper has three contributions: First, the "double-blindness" issue in intent inference, i.e., inferring H's intent requires knowledge about H's inference of M's intent, is addressed. An empathetic intent inference algorithm is proposed, where H's intent, along with its inference of M's intent, are jointly inferred. Second, vehicle dynamics is explicitly incorporated into intent inference to acknowledge its influence on decision making in driving by the drivers' knowledge about dynamical properties of surrounding vehicles. Lastly, a courtesy loss that leverages intent inference is introduced. This loss measures the expected additional loss to H caused by M's motion from a baseline whereMbehaves rationally and in favor of H. Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate that (1) joint inference and knowledge about vehicle dynamics are important to intent decoding and motion planning, and (2) the proposed courtesy definition leads to more rational motions than those from an existing definition.

ID COLLISION-AVOIDANCE
AB Autonomous anticollision of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is one of the key technologies to realize intelligent decision-making and autonomous control, and it is of great significance to improve the flight safety and survivability of UAV in complex environment. Firstly, the UAV autonomous anticollision system configuration is constructed in this paper, and the UAV autonomous anticollision problem and related models are described. Then, the potential collision conflict prediction rules are defined, and a practical three-dimensional collision conflict prediction method is proposed. Finally, the UAV autonomous avoidance decision-making method is designed by using the optimization theory, and the corresponding simple and feasible flight control law is put forward. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed method can ensure the flight safety of UAV by relying on autonomous decision-making and control strategy, so as to realize the autonomous anticollision between a single UAV and non-cooperative dynamic obstacles in three-dimensional airspace.

AB Biomimetic Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (BAUVs) navigate aquatic environments by mimicking natural propellants from fish species. These vehicles move part(s) of their bodies using various mechanisms to propel and swim forward or laterally. Their main goal is to follow and adjust defined paths to reach a target autonomously. Local path planning is of paramount importance during navigation tasks due to unexpected obstacles. Moreover, path planning strategies should consider the environment's information obtained by the vehicle during its mission, as well as its dynamics and mechanical limitations, to define new routes properly. This article presents the development of a waypoint generator based on the D* Lite algorithm. The proposed planner considers a frontal-short-sighted and tail-actuated BAUV with motion constraints to adjust the vehicle's path towards a target coordinate. By identifying obstacles, the planner adjusts and defines inner waypoints inside the vehicle's vision range by considering closeness to obstacles found and BAUV's current position. The developed strategy reduces collision risks due to the discrimination of nodes near obstacles, prioritizing broad hallways and safer swimming distances between the vehicle's current position and inner waypoints. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is simulated using the BAUV's hydrodynamics model and by adding a waypoint tracking controller to correct the vehicle's swimming performance inside three scenarios. The vehicle can reach the goal by properly defining inner waypoints while safely avoiding collisions, narrow hallways, and sharp turns.

AB Travelers choose transport modes on the basis of their preferences in which the features onboard vehicles affect the choice of transport modes. In economic theory, it is found that travelers seek to maximize their travel utilities. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are to be on the market when machines will replace human drivers. AVs are to be used for different purposes, such as transporting passengers and goods. In literature, some research studied AVs in combination with other transport modes, whereas fewer studies have considered the impact of a camera onboard carsharing and privately shared autonomous vehicles (PSAVs) on traveler choices. This research was developed to predict the impact of traveler preferences on the availability of PSAV and carsharing considering certain variables, such as travel time, travel cost, waiting/walking time, and the availability of camera onboard (i.e., as an indication of comfort and privacy factors). A stated preference (SP) survey was designed in which sociodemographic and travel variables were included. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was designed and included in the SP survey. The SP survey was distributed in Budapest, Hungary, where 313 respondents were collected. The discrete choice modeling approach is used, in which the multinomial logit (MNL) model was applied in developing a transport mode choice model. The developed model estimated the impact of different variables on transport modes as well as the willingness of travelers to use carsharing and PSAVs. The model explained the effects of trip length, income, gender, education, occupation, frequent current transport mode, and trip purpose on travelers' selection of transport mode. In conclusion, it demonstrated that people tend to use carsharing more than PSAVs, and the availability of cameras onboard decreases the probability of using a transport mode.

AB Autonomous driving is the main application of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in the field of intelligent transportation. In autonomous driving, self-driving cars will avoid changing lanes in a short distance. When the self-driving car executes the follow-up instruction, the road smoothness in front of the car will affect the driving safety and comfort of the car. The real-time acquisition of road information in front of driving will help the self-driving car adjust driving behavior. However, other vehicles on the road will lead to the failure of Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) detectors to obtain complete road point cloud data. The incomplete road point cloud data need to be imputated to avoid potential misjudgements of the road conditions. Currently, little research work specifically focuses on imputating the incomplete road point cloud data that are caused by obstacle vehicles. In this paper, we propose a fast method to imputate the incomplete road point cloud data using a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)-based parallel Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation algorithm to enhance the safety of autonomous driving. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, two groups of experiments are conducted. The experimental results indicate the following: (1) the known point cloud data within 5 meters around the obstacle vehicle are sufficient to guarantee the imputation accuracy; (2) when the weight parameter of the IDW interpolation is 4, the efficiency and accuracy of the imputation can be optimally balanced; and (3) it takes approximately 0.6 seconds to imputate the incomplete dataset consisting of 15 million points, while the imputation error is approximately 5 millimeters. The proposed method is capable of efficiently and effectively imputating the incomplete road point cloud data that are induced by obstacle vehicles and outperforms other interpolation algorithms and machine learning algorithms.

AB Accurately predicting lane-changing behaviors (lane keeping, left lane change and right lane change) in real-time is essential for ensuring traffic safety, particularly in mixed-traffic environments with both autonomous and manual vehicles. This paper proposes a fused model that predicts vehicle lane-changing behaviors based on the road traffic environment and vehicle motion parameters. The model combines the ensemble learning XGBoost algorithm with the deep learning Bi-GRU neural network. The XGBoost algorithm first checks whether the present environment is safe for the lane change and then evaluates the likelihood that the target vehicle will make a lane change. Subsequently, the Bi-GRU neural network is used to accurately forecast the lane-changing behaviors of nearby vehicles using the feasibility of lane-changing and the vehicle's motion status as input features. The highD trajectory dataset was utilized for training and testing the model. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.82%, accurately predicting lane changes with an accuracy exceeding 87% within a 2-second timeframe. By comparing with other methods and conducting experimental validation, we have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed model, thus, the research achievement is of utmost significance for the practical application of autonomous driving technology.

AB Kalman filter (KF) and its variants are commonly used in estimating states of dynamical systems. For accurate estimation of states, researchers have developed intelligent KFs by combining them with machine learning algorithms. The inherent variations in the vehicle dynamics and uncertainties in the environment require the development of an autonomous sequential framework for continuous estimation. Further, the need for real-time estimation of states in certain applications requires low computer memory usage and low computational cost while implementing autonomous-structured learning algorithms. In this paper, a parsimonious autonomous sequential estimator (PASE) is proposed, which combines the KF-based estimator and autonomous-structured recurrent parsimonious learning machine (rPALM) in a sequential manner. The rPALM overcomes the dependency on target variables while point-to-hyperplane distance calculation. The performance of PASE has been evaluated extensively by comparing it with various batch-learning algorithms and single-pass learning-based intelligent estimators. The results clearly indicate that PASE provides better estimation accuracy with a compact architecture for both linear and nonlinear dynamical systems. Finally, the performance of PASE has been evaluated with experimental data for the state estimation of an unmanned ground vehicle while the training of the learning machine is performed with the simulated data. The estimation accuracy in such a scenario is justifying its appropriateness in real-world applications.

AB In this paper, we present an algorithm for decentralized control of multiple automated guided vehicles performing transportation tasks within industrial and warehousing environments. By running on each vehicle in the system, the algorithm provides vehicles with capabilities for autonomous path planning and motion co-ordination. The path planning part of the algorithm implements a free-ranging motion scheme by determining the shortest feasible paths considering nonholonomic vehicle constraints. The motion co-ordination part of the algorithm ensures safe vehicle motions by reliable detection and resolution of different conflict situations with other vehicles in the shared workspace. Conflict resolution is based on a vehicle priority scheme and results in temporary stopping or removal of the lower priority vehicles taking part in the conflict. Removal action is always performed within the vehicle's private zone, i.e., the pre-allocated local region of the workspace surrounding the vehicle. By encoding information on the vehicle size and its kinematic constraints, the introduced private zone mechanism provides the necessary physical space required for successful execution of every removal action. We also analyze the stability of the presented algorithm and discuss its deadlock-free and livelock-free properties. Algorithm performance has been validated by simulation using ten vehicles and experimentally on two different setups-a laboratory setup comprising five Pioneer 3DX vehicles and by two state-of-the-art autonomous forklifts in industrial-like operating conditions.
   Note to Practitioners-Efficient co-ordination of multiple material handling vehicles in warehousing operations is a complex and challenging task. The current industrial state of the art relies on a centralized controller, which dispatches transport missions to vehicles along predetermined paths. While this approach makes it easier to ensure correct system operation, it suffers from several drawbacks: the paths have to be laid out in advance, which is time-consuming and can be suboptimal; centralized planning does not scale well, as the number of vehicle increases and it includes a single point of failure into the system. In this paper, we present a decentralized approach with free-ranging vehicles, where each vehicle plans its own paths to complete assigned missions and negotiates with other vehicles for right of way in order to avoid collisions. This approach has the potential to improve system performance, as vehicles plan optimal, shortest paths to reach their goals. It also solves the scalability issues, as each vehicle makes its own plans, and negotiates for priority only with neighboring vehicles in the cases when conflicts arise. Correct system operation is ensured by introducing private zones, in which vehicles can safely perform avoidance maneuvers. In this paper, we describe and analyze our approach and present experiments that demonstrate its effectiveness in simulation, on laboratory robotic platforms and on the state-of-the-art industrial vehicles. Our algorithm performance has been verified in environments with obstacles, while operation in corridors and cluttered spaces is the subject of our ongoing research. Furthermore, extensive experiments under realistic industrial conditions need to be performed in order to fully validate the applicability and efficiency of our approach.

AB Unlike popular modularized framework, end-to-end autonomous driving seeks to solve the perception, decision and control problems in an integrated way, which can be more adapting to new scenarios and easier to generalize at scale. However, existing end-to-end approaches are often lack of interpretability, and can only deal with simple driving tasks like lane keeping. In this article, we propose an interpretable deep reinforcement learning method for end-to-end autonomous driving, which is able to handle complex urban scenarios. A sequential latent environment model is introduced and learned jointly with the reinforcement learning process. With this latent model, a semantic birdeye mask can be generated, which is enforced to connect with certain intermediate properties in today's modularized framework for the purpose of explaining the behaviors of learned policy. The latent space also significantly reduces the sample complexity of reinforcement learning. Comparison tests in a realistic driving simulator show that the performance of our method in urban scenarios with crowded surrounding vehicles dominates many baselines including DQN, DDPG, TD3 and SAC. Moreover, through masked outputs, the learned model is able to provide a better explanation of how the car reasons about the driving environment.

AB Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is an efficient and proven method for optimization-based autonomous vehicle motion planning. Among the various approaches, the iterative linear quadratic regulator, a differential dynamic programming variant, is a well-known efficient nonlinear optimization method. In safety-critical control systems, controllers should address inequality-constrained optimization problems. In this letter, we design a single unified constraint using an occupancy grid map. We convert this inequality-constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained optimization problem by appending a single integrated discrete barrier state to the system model. This approach simplifies complex motion planning problems and reduces computational costs. In the proposed method, we first discretize the surrounding environment with an occupancy grid map and design a single constraint that ensures that only cells with values less than a predefined threshold can be traversed by the ego vehicle. Then, we define a single integrated discrete barrier state to introduce this constraint into the motion planning algorithm. The proposed method, a penalty method, and the augmented Lagrangian method are tested on a real-time software-in-the-loop simulation using CarMaker and ROS. The simulation results of pop-up obstacle avoidance scenarios show the benefits of the proposed method, such as reduced time costs and increased robustness.

AB The article mainly presents that a simple antenna structure with only two branches can provide the characteristics of dual-band and wide bandwidths. The recommended antenna design is composed of a clockwise spiral shape, and the design has a gradual impedance change. Thus, this antenna is ideal for applications also recommended in these wireless standards, including 5G, B5G, 4G, V2X, ISM band of WLAN, Bluetooth, WiFI 6 band, WiMAX, and Sirius/XM Radio for in-vehicle infotainment systems. The proposed antenna with a dimension of 10 x 5 mm is simple and easy to make and has a lot of copy production. The operating frequency is covered with a dual-band from 2000 to 2742 MHz and from 4062 to beyond 8000 MHz and, it is also demonstrated that the measured performance results of return loss, radiation, and gain are in good agreement with simulations. The radiation efficiency can reach 91% and 93% at the lower and higher bands. Moreover, the antenna gain can achieve 2.7 and 6.75 dBi at the lower and higher bands, respectively. This antenna design has a low profile, low cost, and small size features that may be implemented in autonomous vehicles and mobile IoT communication system devices.

AB This paper deals with a hierarchical solution approach for multi-objective optimisation of an autonomous vehicle-based storage and retrieval system (AVS/RS) warehouse design. As a result of recent technological and Industry 4.0 developments, industries tend to automise their facilities using systems such as AVS/RS, an intra-logistics system, mostly utilised by large distribution centres. Compared to a traditional crane-based automated storage and retrieval system (AS/RS), these systems are more advantageous for having a flexible travel pattern of autonomous vehicles, enabling the designer vary the number of vehicles in the system based on the changed demand environment. Since it may affect the initial and operational costs as well as the system efficiency significantly, it is important to decide on the right warehouse design at first for these systems. In this paper, a multi-objective optimisation solution procedure under a hierarchical approach for the design of an AVS/RS, by considering minimisation of two conflicting performance measures - average cycle time and average energy consumption per transaction - is presented. By this work, it is also aimed to attract the attention of practitioners for the significance of multi-objective performance optimisation. For the multi-objective optimisation, Pareto-optimal solutions are presented.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being used in many challenging and diversified applications. Meanwhile, UAV's ability of autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance becomes more and more critical. This paper focuses on filling up the gap between deep reinforcement learning (DRL) theory and practical application by involving attention mechanism and hierarchical mechanism to solve some severe problems encountered in the practical application of DRL. More specifically, in order to improve the robustness of DRL, we use averaged estimation function instead of the normal value estimation function. Then, we design a recurrent network and a temporal attention mechanism to improve the performance of the algorithm. Third, we propose a hierarchical framework to improve its performance on long-term tasks. Some realistic simulation environments, as well as the real-world, are used to evaluate the proposed UAV autonomous navigation method. The results demonstrate that our DRL-based navigation method performs well in different environments and outperforms the original DrQ algorithm.

AB Recent dramatic increase in e-commerce has also increased the adoption of automation technologies in warehouses. Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) are from those technologies widely utilized in warehouse operations. It is important to design the operation of those robotic systems in such a way that, they meet the current and future system requirements correctly. In this paper, we study flexible travel of AMRs in warehouses by developing smart deadlock and collision prevention algorithms on agent-based modelling. By that, AMR agents can interact with each other and environment, so that they can make smart decisions maximizing their goals. We compare the performance of the developed flexible travel system with non-flexible designs where there is a single AMR dedicated to a specific zone so that no deadlock or collision possibility takes place. The results show that AMRs may provide up to 39% improvement in the flexible system compared to its non-flexible design.

AB Speckle velocimetry is investigated as a means of determining odometry data with potential for application on autonomous robotic vehicles. The technique described here relies on the integration of translation measurements made by normalized cross-correlation of speckle patterns to determine the change in position over time. The use of objective (non-imaged) speckle offers a number of advantages over subjective (imaged) speckle, such as a reduction in the number of optical components, reduced modulation of speckles at the edges of the image, and improved light efficiency. The influence of the source/ detector configuration on the speckle translation to vehicle translation scaling factor for objective speckle is investigated using a computer model and verified experimentally. Experimental measurements are presented at velocities up to 80 mm s(-1) which show accuracy better than 0.4%. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America

AB In recent years, many sectors have experienced significant progress in automation, associated with the growing advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning. There are already automated robotic weapons, which are able to evaluate and engage with targets on their own, and there are already autonomous vehicles that do not need a human driver. It is argued that the use of increasingly autonomous systems (AS) should be guided by the policy of human control, according to which humans should execute a certain significant level of judgment over AS. While in the military sector there is a fear that AS could mean that humans lose control over life and death decisions, in the transportation domain, on the contrary, there is a strongly held view that autonomy could bring significant operational benefits by removing the need for a human driver. This article explores the notion of human control in the United States in the two domains of defense and transportation. The operationalization of emerging policies of human control results in the typology of direct and indirect human controls exercised over the use of AS. The typology helps to steer the debate away from the linguistic complexities of the term "autonomy." It identifies instead where human factors are undergoing important changes and ultimately informs about more detailed rules and standards formulation, which differ across domains, applications, and sectors.

AB With the promising development and deployment trends of autonomous vehicles (AVs), AVs' operation safety has become a key issue worldwide. Studies have been conducted to reveal the risk factors of AV operation safety based upon AV-involved crash reports. However, the crash data sample size was limited and the crash reports only recorded static information, thus it failed to identify crash contributing factors and further provide feedbacks to AV algorithm development. In this study, the risk factors were investigated based upon hazardous scenarios, which were claimed to possess consistent causal mechanisms with crash events. First, contributing factors were extracted from both vehicle kinematics and traffic environment aspects, and their volatility features were obtained. Then, path analysis models were developed to reveal the concurrent relationships between scenario volatility and hazardous scenario occurrence probability. Besides, to understand the varying risk factors for hazardous scenarios caused by human drivers and AVs, a logit regression model was further established. The modeling results showed that large volatility of space headway held direct impacts on increasing the AV driving risks. And the volatility of the drivable road area had no significant impacts on AV driving risks while it indirectly influenced human driving risks. Finally, result implications for AV driving behavior improvements have been discussed.

AB Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) idea was developed to improve road safety, traffic management efficiency, and environmental preservation. The fog- robotics Based Intelligent Transportation Systems integrate Internet of Vehicles (IoV) devices to Fog Computing (FC) centers, which process the data. On the other hand, providing massive data from widely distant devices causes network overhead and bottlenecks in Autonomous Driving and a drain on Energy Management. To fill this research gap, fog-robotics-based intelligent transportation systems are proposed to cover the line-of-sight direction for path adopting self-directed intelligent transportation. The Intelligent Transportation Systems with FC Techniques work towards the Fog Robotics Platform for making efficient fog- robotics Transportation Systems. The Proposed System has two functionalities; firstly, the analysis of automatic Fog- robotics transportation systems is introducing decentralized wireless sensor transfer assisted flocking autonomous driving for energy management of fog- robotics transportation systems. It Shows the Sensor activities as per the "scanning of the roadside meter." It enumerates speed control. Secondly, Artificial Intelligence Enabled Intelligent speed assistance is formed based on Vehicle Infrastructure Integration (VII). This Vehicle infrastructure integration is used to show the Smart highway, which is adaptable with the fog- robotics Transportation Systems. Although the formation of "Digital modeling and fabrication framework" procedural aspect employed to connect the "Fog- robotics Transportation Systems" and "Vehicle infrastructure integration." This Artificial Intelligence configuration is used to Enabled Intelligent speed assistance for controlling the car for their atmosphere. Finally, these rely on are consolidated with the position/navigation system, and the vehicle detection ratio is analyzed with the vehicle efficiency and economic activity for intelligent speed assistance.

AB Recently, Cyber-Physical System (CPS) has served as a cutting-edge technology for next-generation industrial applications, and is developing rapidly and inspires many application domains. The autonomous electric bus (AEB) that integrates the communication, perception, and control within vehicle dynamics is a typical CPS. However, the energy management is ignored in the vehicle cyber-physical system. Thus, a novelty cyberphysical-energy system (CPES) approach with deep integration and interaction of the cyber system with physical system for the energy management used cruising control is imposed. Under the new CPES framework, the energy consumption and battery capacity degradation are optimized in different driving environment. Simulation results show that the tradeoff optimization control algorithm can keep battery health by optimizing motor operating mode with a slightly penalty on the energy consumption. The total system cost effective analysis shows that the battery service lifetime is improved by about 41.59% with the proposed method, and even with the slightly sacrifice of power consumption, the whole vehicle economy is improved by about 10.08%, compared with the strategy optimizing the power consumption only. Additionally, the equivalent driving distance is significantly extended up to 70.87% when compared to the case that only energy consumption is optimized. Besides, the AEB with CPES framework not only keeps the host vehicle within the safe distance with the preceding vehicle, but optimizes the motion planning as well. The results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the CPES-based optimization framework, and demonstrate the advantages of the tradeoff optimization energy management strategy.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) use secondary velocity over ground measurements to aid the Inertial Navigation System (INS) to avoid unbounded drift in the point-to-point navigation solution. When operating in deep open ocean (i.e., in blue water-beyond the frequency-specific instrument range), the velocity measurements are either based on water column velocities or completely unavailable. In such scenarios, the velocity-relative-to-water measurements from an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) are often used for INS aiding. ADCPs have a blanking distance (typically ranging between 0.5 and 5 m) in proximity to the device in which the flow velocity data are undetectable. Hence, water velocities used to aid the INS solution can be significantly different from that near the vehicle and are subjected to significant noise. Previously, the authors introduced a nonacoustic method to calculate the water velocity components of a turbulent water column within the ADCP dead zone using the AUV motion response (referred to as the WVAM method). The current study analyzes the feasibility of incorporating the WVAM method within the INS by investigating the accuracy of it at different turbulence levels of the water column. Findings of this work demonstrate that the threshold limits of the method can be improved in the nonlinear ranges (i.e., at low and high levels of energy); however, by estimating a more accurate representation of vehicle hydrodynamic coefficients, this method has proven robust in a range of tidally induced flow conditions. The WVAM method, in its current state, offers significant potential to make a key contribution to blue water navigation when integrated within the vehicle's INS.

AB In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed for the vision-based object tracking by autonomous vehicles. To estimate the velocity of the tracked object, the algorithm fuses the information captured by the vehicle's on-board sensors such as the cameras and inertial motion sensors. Optical flow vectors, color features, stereo pair disparities are used as optical features while the vehicle's inertial measurements are used to determine the cameras' motion. The algorithm determines the velocity and position of the target in the world coordinate which are then tracked by the vehicle. In order to formulate this tracking algorithm, it is necessary to use a proper model which describes the dynamic information of the tracked object. However due to the complex nature of the moving object, it is necessary to have robust and adaptive dynamic models. Here, several simple and basic linear dynamic models are selected and combined to approximate the unpredictable, complex or highly nonlinear dynamic properties of the moving target. With these basic linear dynamic models, a detailed description of the three-dimensional (3D) target tracking scheme using the Interacting Multiple Models (IMM) along with an Extended Kalman Filter is presented. The final state of the target is estimated as a weighted combination of the outputs from each different dynamic model. Performance of the proposed fusion based IMM tracking algorithm is demonstrated through extensive experimental results. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID ADVANCED DRIVER ASSISTANCE; GENERATION; SEARCH; CARS
AB Offline model-level testing of autonomous driving software is much cheaper, faster, and diversified than in-field, online system-level testing. Hence, researchers have compared empirically model-level vs system-level testing using driving simulators. They reported the general usefulness of simulators at reproducing the same conditions experienced in-field, but also some inadequacy of model-level testing at exposing failures that are observable only in online mode. In this work, we replicate the reference study on model vs system-level testing of autonomous vehicles while acknowledging several assumptions that we had reconsidered. These assumptions are related to several threats to validity affecting the original study that motivated additional analysis and the development of techniques to mitigate them. Moreover, we also extend the replicated study by evaluating the original findings when considering a physical, radio-controlled autonomous vehicle. Our results show that simulator-based testing of autonomous driving systems yields predictions that are close to the ones of real-world datasets when using neural-based translation to mitigate the reality gap induced by the simulation platform. On the other hand, model-level testing failures are in line with those experienced at the system level, both in simulated and physical environments, when considering the pre-failure site, similar-looking images, and accurate labels.

AB It is crucial to understand the mechanism of how people perceive and accept Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) to realize the benefits that they will bring to transport networks, including increased safety on the roads. Experience with semi-automated cars and Autonomous Vehicle (AV) demonstration projects has been shown to positively affect acceptance of AVs, however automated transport technologies have been adopted in practice for years such as automated railways and aircraft autopilot; whether there are any connections between exposure to automated railways and aircraft autopilot and acceptance of SAVs is not well known. We explored the connections between trust in safety, knowledge of, and experience with automated railways, aircraft autopilot, and ADAS and intention to use a SAV. We surveyed individuals from Korea National University of Transportation (KNUT) in Chungju, Korea (n = 226), who will soon be able to use a SAV service, and adopted a model based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). We found there to indeed be a connection between exposure to and trust in the safety of existing automated transport modes and acceptance of a SAV. Constructs with the strongest effects were found to be trust in safety of automated transport, hedonic motivation, perceived ease-of-use, perceived usefulness, and knowledge of automated transport. Experience with automated railways, but not semi-automated cars, was found to negatively moderate the relationship between hedonic motivation and intention to use a SAV. We discuss the policy implications of these results.

AB Ego-vehicle state prediction represents a complex and challenging problem for self-driving and autonomous vehicles. Sensorial information and on-board cameras are used in perception-based solutions in order to understand the state of the vehicle and the surrounding traffic conditions. Monocular camera-based methods are becoming increasingly popular for driver assistance, with precise predictions of vehicle speed and emergency braking being important for road safety enhancement, especially in the prevention of speed-related accidents. In this research paper, we introduce the implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model tailored for the prediction of vehicle velocity, braking events, and emergency braking, employing sequential image sequences and velocity data as inputs. The CNN model is trained on a dataset featuring sequences of 20 consecutive images and corresponding velocity values, all obtained from a moving vehicle navigating through road-traffic scenarios. The model's primary objective is to predict the current vehicle speed, braking actions, and the occurrence of an emergency-brake situation using the information encoded in the preceding 20 frames. We subject our proposed model to an evaluation on a dataset using regression and classification metrics, and comparative analysis with existing published work based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Through our efforts to improve the prediction accuracy for velocity, braking behavior, and emergency-brake events, we make a substantial contribution to improving road safety and offer valuable insights for the development of perception-based techniques in the field of autonomous vehicles.

AB The paper proposes motion control strategies for automated road vehicles to handle interactions among vehicles. The control strategies are built in a hierarchical structure, which contains a high-level learning-based control, a low-level robust control and an optimization-based supervisor. The purposes of the control strategies are to guarantee collision-free motion of the vehicles, and moreover to improve economy and traveling time performance levels. In the paper two configurations of the hierarchical structure are proposed, which are based on the centralized and independent design for automated vehicle motion. The paper presents the comparison of the two configurations through simulation examples. Moreover, the operation of the independent configuration on a small-scaled indoor test vehicle platform is also presented.

AB This paper investigates the safe cooperative path following of connected autonomous surface vehicles subject to static and dynamic obstacles, as well as physical constraints. A barrier-certified model predictive cooperative path following control method is proposed with the capability of collision avoidance and constraint satisfaction. Specifically, a robust-exact-differentiators-based extended state observer is employed to estimate the unknown kinetics including model uncertainties and external disturbances. Based on a path variable containment approach, a nominal receding-horizon control law is designed to achieve cooperative path following task within the physical constraints. A safe optimal control law is designed based on control barrier functions to generate optimal surge force and heading angle within the safety constraints. A receding-horizon heading control law is designed to track the desired heading signals. Constrained quadratic programming problems are formulated and solved via neurodynamic optimization. Simulation results are elaborated to validate the efficacy of the proposed barrier-certified model predictive control method for cooperative path following subject to static and dynamic obstacles.

AB Objective: Food deliveries to consumers using autonomous vehicles are forecast to become commonplace in Australia and globally. The aims of this study were to (i) explore the anticipated nature of AV food delivery services in Australia and (ii) identify available policy options to optimise positive outcomes and minimise any negative consequences for health and well-being.Methods: In total, 36 interviews were conducted with 40 expert stakeholders across a range of relevant sectors including transport, urban planning, health and telecommunications. Interviewees discussed the ways in which automated food deliveries are likely to be implemented and the potential implications for lifestyles and health.Results: The interviewees expected automated food deliveries to constitute an extension of current trends towards online food ordering and rapid home deliveries, with potential adverse implications for diet quality at the population level. Conclusions: Effective regulation of automated food and beverage delivery services will be needed to anticipate and address this emerging phenomenon.Implications for Public Health: There is the opportunity to optimise the public health outcomes associated with automated food deliveries while minimising potential negative consequences through proactive anticipatory action. Delays could result in undesirable and irreversible changes to the food environment.

AB Quickly finding high-quality paths is of great significance for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in path planning problems. In this paper, we present a cylinder-based heuristic rapidly exploring random tree (Cyl-HRRT*) algorithm, which is the extension version of the path planner presented in our previous publication. Cyl-HRRT* increases the likelihood of sampling states that can improve the current solution by biasing the states into a cylindrical subset, thus providing better paths for AUVs. A direct greedy sampling method is proposed to explore the space more efficiently and accelerate convergence to the optimum. To reasonably balance the optimization accuracy and the number of iterations, a beacon-based adaptive optimization strategy is presented, which adaptively establishes a cylindrical subset for the next focused sampling according to the current path. Furthermore, the Cyl-HRRT* algorithm is shown to be probabilistically complete and asymptotically optimal. Finally, the Cyl-HRRT* algorithm is comprehensively tested in both simulations and real-world experiments. The results reveal that the path generated by the Cyl-HRRT* algorithm greatly improves the power savings and mobility of the AUV.

AB Prior research has estimated the impact of an autonomous vehicle (AV) environment on the mobility of underserved populations such as adult non-drivers. What is currently unknown is the impact of AVs on enhancing the mobility of children who are also mobility disadvantaged, as child passengers are likely part of AV ridership scenarios in the perceivable future. To address this question, our study collected perceived benefits and concerns of AVs from a US convenience sample of parents whose children relied on them for mobility. We found that parents' intentions to travel in AV and their technology readiness as well as parent (sex, residence area) and child (age, restraint system) demographic profiles were important determinants of potential AV acceptance and impact. In addition, two groups of potential AV users emerged from the data: the curious and the practical. This study addresses a gap in the literature by assessing parents' perspectives on using AVs to transport children. The results have great potentials to guide the design of mobility features, safety evaluations, and implementation policies, as a decline in public interest in AVs has been recently documented.

AB High-accuracy and reliable autonomous navigation is increasingly crucial for automated transfer vehicles (ATV). This paper proposes a novel strapdown inertial navigation system/celestial navigation system (SINS/CNS) tight integration scheme aided by dynamic model constraints for high-orbit ATV to realize accurate and autonomous navigation. In this scheme, the complete weightlessness constraint in orbit is used to address the divergence of position and velocity caused by inaccurate accelerometer bias estimation problem encountered in the traditional SINS/CNS integration method, and the image point position-based tight integration model is derived to handle the adverse influence of time-varying attitude measurement noise due to changes of star geometry observed by a large-view-filed star sensor. Moreover, an information filter is devised to fuse the multi-rate measurements. The proposed algorithm is evaluated by a representative high-orbit ATV trajectory simulation, which indicates significant improvements in navigation accuracy compared with its traditional counterparts. The proposed algorithm can realize navigation accuracy enhancements without introducing additional sensors, strengthening its potentials in engineering application.

AB This paper deals with the trajectory tracking problem of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and time -varying external disturbances. Three exponentially convergent robust controllers, namely, the min-max type controller, the saturation type controller and the smooth transition type controller are proposed to drive an AUV to track a predefined trajectory. It is shown that the filtered tracking errors, position tracking errors and velocity tracking errors for the three proposed controllers are exponentially convergent. Moreover, all the above tracking errors for the three proposed controllers can be shaped by specific analytic expressions and such expressions illustrate how the transient responses of the above tracking errors can be modified by adjusting the control parameters. The characteristics of the three proposed controllers are summarized and demonstrated with numerical simulations. Theoretical comparison analysis and comparative simulations with the existing RISE-based controller of AUV are presented to show the effectiveness of the three proposed exponentially convergent robust controllers.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB To enable autonomous vehicles to respond quickly to changes in the surrounding environment and to generate safe and stable trajectory, we propose a safety-based hierarchical trajectory planning method that divides the planning module into two parts: the planner and the replanning monitor. In the planner, we first propose a fast linear trajectory planning method that uses the mass point model instead of the vehicle model and linearizes the collision avoidance constraint using the Big-M method for linear programming (Big-M) to obtain a linear programming model. The complete vehicle kinematic model is then built in the nonlinear programming stage, the collision constraints and cost functions are refined, and the rough solution of the linear programming is brought into it to obtain the exact solution. The replanning monitor is divided into safety and comfort monitors. The safety monitor will always pay attention to the changes in the surrounding environment and calculate whether the vehicle is in danger of collision in the future period, while the comfort monitor is more concerned with the comfort of driving the vehicle; when the monitor requirements are not met, replanning will be carried out. By simulating the driving environment, the proposed algorithm can form a safe and comfortable trajectory, which verifies the rationality of the proposed method.

AB This article details the design, construction and implementation of a novel, spherical unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) prototype for operations within confined, entanglement-prone marine environments. The nature of shipwreck interiors, the exploration of which the vehicle was originally designed, imposes special risks that constrain system requirements while promoting other attributes uncommon in typical open-water UUV designs. The invention, the Wreck Interior Exploration Vehicle (WIEVLE), was constructed using 3-D additive manufacturing technology combined with relatively inexpensive commercial components. Similar inventions are compared, followed by a thorough review of the physical and functional characteristics of the system. The key attributes of the design include a smooth, spherical hull with 360-degree sensor coverage, and a fixed, upward-angled thruster core, relying on inherent buoyancy to take the place of a dedicated depth-changing mechanism. Initial open-loop control testing demonstrated stable 4 degrees of freedom (DOF) maneuvering capability. The article concludes with an overview of the results of the initial testing, a review of how the key system design attributes address the unique shipwreck interior exploration challenges, and a plan for the future development of the platform.

AB In recent years, the concept of autonomous road vehicles has gained a great deal of technical respectability, with expected fuel benefits arising from running vehicles closely in platoons. However, the aerodynamics of such vehicles travelling in close proximity is still not understood. This paper presents for the first time a detailed study of drag benefits and the flow structure around a platoon of high-sided lorries, through conducting Delayed Detached Eddy Simulations (DDES). The lorry surface pressure and slipstream flow characteristics show good agreement with experimental data. Drag reductions of up to 70% have been observed for all trailing lorries in the platoon. Analysis of the flow field indicated highly turbulent regions on the top and sides of trailing lorries. Turbulent kinetic energy and Reynolds stresses were found to concentrate at the connection region between lorry cab and box. Spectral analysis of the side forces identified oscillating behaviour on each lorry in the platoon due to strong vortex shedding, suggesting that platooning lorries are potentially more likely to develop lateral instabilities than an isolated lorry. The study indicates that autonomous vehicle developers and operators should consider the significant drag reduction benefits of platooning against the risk associated with potential lateral instabilities.

AB This article investigates the speed control problem of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) suffering from fully unknown kinetics and propulsion dynamics. A data-driven finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) strategy is presented for tracking a desired surge velocity. In the learning loop, a data-driven neural predictor is present to learn the unknown input gains, model nonlinearities, and environmental disturbances simultaneously. Filtered data of vehicle states are recorded and used to update the neural network parameters. In the control loop, a pulsewidth-modulation-driven speed controller is developed based on the FCS-MPC technique. The optimal control actions are selected based on the receding horizon optimization with a prediction model. The learning error system of the data-driven neural predictor is proved to be input-to-state stable via Lyapunov analysis. A major feature of the proposed method is that optimal performance can be provided for speed tracking without using any a priori knowledge of model parameters or external disturbances. Simulation results substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed data-driven FCS-MPC strategy for an ASV to track a reference surge velocity.

AB The spread of autonomous vehicles (AVs) could fundamentally change tourism-related mobility in the near future. However, the empirical research on tourism impacts is still very limited. This research aims to systematize the expected tourism impacts of AVs and to explore how experts in different fields of tourism view the technological innovation ahead. The opinions of tourism experts (n = 21) involved in the research were analyzed using the Q methodology. Statements (n = 40) were formulated in topics derived from the literature. Based on the analysis, we distinguished four groups of opinions. An optimistic, technology-oriented group of experts suggested that AV-based sightseeing may emerge as a prominent unconventional service. An accessibility-focused group of experts predicting slow progress stressed that the spread of AVs could improve access to infrastructurally advanced destinations. A mobility-service-oriented group considered that the use of AVs is becoming conventional in terms of mobility, but its appearance remains unconventional for other tourism services. Due to the potential negative effects, a skeptical group of experts believes that AVs will not become conventional in tourism. The value of the research is the creation of groups based on tourism experts' attitudes, which can help prepare strategic tourism decisions in the future.

AB This paper investigates the problem of path following control of the underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles in the presence of model uncertainties and external disturbances. With the three-dimensional path following error model established based on virtual guidance method, a path following robust control system is proposed using the command filtered backstepping control, neural networks, and adaptive control techniques. Then, a Lyapunov-based stability analysis demonstrates that all the signals are bounded and path following errors ultimately converge to a neighborhood of the origin. Following advantages are highlighted in this paper: 1) the derivative of virtual control is obtained via a second-order filter, which avoids explosion of complexity in the traditional backstepping design, and filters out high frequency measurement noise to keep the control system more robust, and a filtered error compensation loop is developed to guarantee the approximation precision between the virtual control signals and the filtered signals and 2) the presented controller is easily put into practice without any former knowledge of vehicle parameters and external environmental disturbances. Finally, the simulations are conducted, and results illustrate the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed control system through a new class of flying wing autonomous underwater vehicle.

AB This letter presents an autonomous navigation system for ground robots traversing aggressive unstructured terrain through a cohesive arrangement of mapping, deliberative planning and reactive behaviour modules. All systems are aware of terrain slope, visibility and vehicle orientation, enabling robots to recognize, plan and react around unobserved areas and overcome negative obstacles, slopes, steps, overhangs and narrow passageways. This is one of pioneer works to explicitly and simultaneously couple mapping, planning and reactive components in dealing with negative obstacles. The system was deployed on three heterogeneous ground robots for the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, and we present results in Urban and Cave environments, along with simulated scenarios, that demonstrate this approach.

AB The attitude control and depth tracking issue of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) are addressed in this paper. By introducing a nonsingular coordinate transformation, a novel nonlinear reduced-order observer (NROO) is presented to achieve an accurate estimation of AUV's state variables. A discrete-time model predictive control with nonlinear model online linearization (MPC-NMOL) is applied to enhance the attitude control and depth tracking performance of AUV considering the wave disturbance near surface. In AUV longitudinal control simulation, the comparisons have been presented between NROO and full-order observer (FOO) and also between MPC-NMOL and traditional NMPC. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB The fuzzy min-max neural network constitutes a neural architecture that is based on hyperbox fuzzy sets and can be incrementally trained by appropriately adjusting the number of hyperboxes and their corresponding volumes. Two versions have been proposed: for supervised and unsupervised learning. In this paper a modified approach is presented that is appropriate for reinforcement learning problems with discrete action space and is applied to the difficult task of autonomous vehicle navigation when no a priori knowledge of the enivronment is available. Experimental results indicate that the proposed reinforcement learning network exhibits superior learning behavior compared to conventional reinforcement schemes.

AB Recently, autonomous vehicles, particularly self-driving cars, have received significant attention owing to rapid advancements in sensor and computation technologies. In addition to traffic sign recognition, road lane detection is one of the most important factors used in lane departure warning systems and autonomous vehicles for maintaining the safety of semi-autonomous and fully autonomous systems. Unlike traffic signs, road lanes are easily damaged by both internal and external factors such as road quality, occlusion (traffic on the road), weather conditions, and illumination (shadows from objects such as cars, trees, and buildings). Obtaining clear road lane markings for recognition processing is a difficult challenge. Therefore, we propose a method to overcome various illumination problems, particularly severe shadows, by using fuzzy system and line segment detector algorithms to obtain better results for detecting road lanes by a visible light camera sensor. Experimental results from three open databases, Caltech dataset, Santiago Lanes dataset (SLD), and Road Marking dataset, showed that our method outperformed conventional lane detection methods.

AB Recent advances in sensing and intelligent control technologies open a whole new dimension in underwater autonomy. However, before truly-capable, autonomous underwater robots can be created for subsea intervention and exploration, many research issues must be first investigated and developed experimentally on testbed platforms.
   OTTER is an underwater robot designed to be used as a testbed for autonomous technologies. Both OTTER's hardware and software systems are configured to support simultaneous development and testing of different concepts for underwater robotic by independent researchers. A general control-software framework enables common access to all subsystems and avoids the duplication of basic robotic functionality jointly required by all projects. Additionally, the new autonomous technologies enabled by the results of individual research are mutually compatible and can be easily integrated into a single robotic system. Examples of new technologies demonstrated on the OTTER underwater robot include control from a real-time vision-sensing system, coordinated arm/vehicle control, and control from 3D graphical user interfaces.

   vehicles; Mode choice; Attitudes; Value of travel time

AB From early studies of time allocation onward, it has been acknowledged that the "productive" nature of travel could affect its utility. Currently, at the margin an individual may choose transit over a shorter automobile trip, if thereby she is able to use the travel time more productively. On the other hand, recent advancements toward partly/fully automated vehicles are poised to revolutionize the perception and utilization of travel time in cars, and are further blurring the role of travel as a crisp transition between location-based activities. To quantify these effects, we created and administered a survey to measure travel multitasking attitudes and behaviors, together with general attitudes, mode-specific perceptions, and standard socioeconomic traits (N = 2229 Northern California commuters). In this paper, we present a revealed preference mode choice model that accounts for the impact of multitasking attitudes and behavior on the utility of various alternatives. We fmd that the propensity to engage in productive activities on the commute, operationalized as using a laptop/tablet, significantly influences utility and accounts for a small but non-trivial portion of the current mode shares. For example, the model estimates that commuter rail, transit, and car/vanpool shares would respectively be 0.11, 0.23, and 1.18 percentage points lower, and the drive-alone share 1.49 percentage points higher, if the option to use a laptop or tablet while commuting were not available. Conversely, in a hypothetical autonomous vehicles scenario, where the car would allow a high level of engagement in productive activities, the drive-alone share would increase by L48 percentage points. The results empirically demonstrate the potential of a multitasking propensity to reduce the disutility of travel time. Further, the methodology can be generalized to account for other properties of autonomous vehicles, among other applications.

AB To better study the biology and ecology of hadal trenches for marine scientists, the Hadal Science and Technology Research Center (HAST) of Shanghai Ocean University proposed to construct a movable laboratory that includes a mothership, several full-ocean-depth (FOD) submersibles, and FOD landers to obtain samples in the hadal trenches. Among these vehicles, the project of an FOD autonomous and remotely-operated vehicle (ARV) named "Dream Chaser" was started in July 2018. The ARV could work in both remotely-operated and autonomous-operated modes, and serves large-range underwater observation, on-site sampling, surveying, mapping, etc. This paper proposed a novel three-body design of the FOD ARV. A detailed illustration of the whole system design method is provided. Numerical simulations and experimental tests for various sub-systems and disciplines have been conducted, such as resistance analysis using the computational fluid mechanics method and structural strength analysis for FOD hydrostatic pressure using the finite element method and pressure chamber tests. In addition, components tests and the entire system tests have been performed on land, underwater, and in the pressure chamber in the laboratory of HAST, and the results are discussed. Extensive experiments of two critical components, i.e., the thrusters and ballast-abandoning system, have been conducted and further analyzed in this paper. Finally, the procedures and results of lake trials, South China Sea trials and the first phase of Mariana Trench sea trials of the ARV in 2020 are also introduced. This paper provides a design method for the novel three-body FOD ARV. More importantly, the lessons learned from the FOD pressure test, lake tests, and sea trials, no matter the success or failure, will guide future endeavors and the application of ARV Dream Chaser and underwater vehicles of this kind.

AB Although the use of low-order equivalent models is common and extensively studied for control of aircraft systems, similar analysis has not been performed for submersible systems. Toward an improved understanding of the utility of low-order equivalent models for submersible systems, we examine control design for pitch-axis motion of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Derived from first principles, the pitch-axis motion of a streamlined AUV is described by third-order dynamics. However, second-order approximate models are common for system identification and control design. in this work, we provide theoretical justification for both the use of and limitations of a second-order model, and we verify our results in practice via a series of case studies. We conclude that a second-order pitch-axis model should often be sufficient for system identification and control design. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This brief deals with lateral dynamic control of electric vehicles in an urban environment, motivated by individual public transportation issues, aimed to contribute to reduce metropolitan areas pollution. The framework in which the control strategy is developed is the so-called "look-down reference," in which the lateral displacement is obtained from a onboard sensor, interacting with a road infrastructure. In this framework, the designed control algorithm is made up of a combined feedback-feedforward structure. The feedback action is' given by three nested closed loops with cascade compensators, where the outer one is nonlinear. The feedforward action is based on the knowledge of the road curvature, corrected by the measure of the car lateral displacement. Results from experimental tests performed on an actual circuit show the effectiveness of the considered control strategy.

AB Supply chain networks are complex structures which introduce significant challenges regarding transparency in production and traceability of components, making product certification non-trivial. Visibility within quality assurance processes is critical to this and is particularly important for autonomous & driver-less vehicles which rely on correct operation of individual parts (in the absence of human intervention) to achieve safety of such vehicles. Failure to ascertain quality assurance of parts can result in rogue behaviour among driver-less vehicles which can result in a risk to human lives. In this paper, a blockchain-based approach -TruCert, is proposed which achieves trustworthy product certification through enhanced visibility within tier 1 and beyond for complex automotive supply chains. Leveraging blockchain technology, TruCert's potential to improve product quality assurance is demonstrated whilst also strengthening supply chain resilience to combat risks and uncertainties. Utilising the use -case of autonomous connected vehicles manufacturing, design and development of TruCert solution is presented including detailed system design, data model, and smart contracts & oracle implementations. TruCert enables trustworthy part certification across supply chain beyond tier 1 whilst achieving interoperability with heterogeneous systems across suppliers and other stakeholders. Outcomes of evaluation with respect to cost, performance, and security are also presented which highlight the effectiveness of the approach whilst identifying directions for future work.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are advanced platforms for detecting and mapping oil spills in deep water. However, their applications in complex spill environments have been hindered by the risk of vehicle loss. Path planning for AUVs is an effective technique for mitigating such risks and ensuring safer routing. Yet pre-vious studies did not address path searching problems for AUVs based on probabilistic risk reasoning. This study aims to propose an offboard risk-based path planning approach for AUVs operating in an oil spill environment. A risk model based on the Bayesian network was developed for probabilistic reasoning of risk states given varied environmental observations. This risk model further assisted in generating a spatially-distributed risk map covering a potential mission area. An A*-based searching algorithm was then employed to plan an optimal-risk path through the constructed risk map. The proposed planner was applied in a case study with a Slocum G1 Glider in a real-world spill environment around Baffin Bay. Simulation results proved that the optimal-risk planner outperforms in risk mitigation while achieving competitive path lengths and mission efficiency. The proposed method is not constrained to AUVs but can be adapted to other marine robotic systems.

AB Real-time performance is one of the major challenges for optimal control and MPC control. In this paper, a novel general open-source C++ MPC solver based on state-of-the-art sparse QP solver OSQP is designed to solve the motion control problem of autonomous vehicles efficiently. A new linear dynamic model is proposed by replacing heading angle error with planning lateral projection speed, whose measurement is independent of the measurement of heading angle. A general local linearization method for the nonlinear tire model is proposed. Through the theory of offset-free MPC control, the steady-state value problem is solved caused by a disturbance in the time domain systematically. The algorithm in this paper is implemented in ROS, which means that the algorithm can be directly used in the prototype development of autonomous vehicles. The proposed MPC solver can solve a linear time-varying or time-invariant system, with or without disturbances. It is very efficient and can handle different kinds of hard and soft constraints. A real-time simulation platform based on Unreal Engine 4 and CarSim is designed to verify the algorithm's effectiveness. Real-time simulations and real vehicle experiments verify the efficiency of the algorithm.

AB In this paper, we develop nonlinear distributed or semi-decentralized cooperative control schemes for a team of heterogeneous autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The objective is to have the network of AUVs follow a desired trajectory, while the agents maintain a desired formation when there is a virtual leader whose position information is only available and known to a very small subset of the agents. The virtual leader does not receive any feedback and information from the other agents and the agents only communicate with their nearest neighboring agents. It is assumed that the model parameters associated with each vehicle/agent is different, although the order of the agents is the same. The developed and proposed nonlinear distributed cooperative control schemes are based on the dynamic surface control methodology for a network of heterogeneous autonomous vehicles with uncertainties. The development and investigation of the dynamic surface control methodology for a team of cooperative heterogenous multi-agent nonlinear systems is accomplished for the first time in the literature. Simulation results corresponding to a team of six AUVs are provided to demonstrate and illustrate the advantages and superiority of our proposed cooperative control strategies as compared to the methods that are available in the literature.

AB A new set of lane changing rules is introduced with that the model introduced in Vranken et al. (2021) is able to simulate multi lane heterogeneous traffic where human driven vehicles mix with automated or communicating automated vehicles. The model predicts that (communicating) automated vehicles will increase road capacity and traffic flow in all traffic situations more strongly than on one lane traffic even though they behave more passive while lane changing and following human driven vehicles. The main reason for this improvement was found to be the creation of automated vehicle platoons naturally organised by the system. (C)& nbsp;2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Autonomous cars are considered to be the next disruptive innovation that will affect consumers. It can be expected that not only traditional automakers will enter this market (e.g., Ford) but also technology companies (e.g., Google) and newer companies dedicated to self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla). We take a brand extension perspective and analyze to what extent consumers prefer autonomous cars from these brand categories. Our empirical study is based on discrete choice experiments about adopting autonomous vehicles in a purchase scenario and in a renting context. Our findings show that brands play a central role when making autonomous driving decisions. Brand preferences differ systematically when buying versus renting a self-driving car. While technology brands are most preferred overall, consumers favor automaker brands over new brands only when purchasing, not when renting. We further disentangle the brand strength into the marginal effects of image associations. For example, Google's strong brand positioning can be explained by experiences with the parent brand, but it could still improve brand strength by highlighting the relevance of the associated brand portfolio for self-driving cars. The effect of these brand extension success factors differs between parent-brand categories and also between the renting and purchasing scenarios, which requires a dedicated brand management.

AB The importance of monitoring and evaluating the quality of water resources has significantly grown over time. To achieve this effectively, an option is to employ an intelligent monitoring system capable of measuring the physical and chemical parameters of water. Surface vehicles equipped with sensors for measuring water quality parameters offer a viable solution for these missions. This work presents a novel approach called AquaHet-PSO, which addresses the challenge of simultaneously monitoring multiple water quality parameters with several peaks of contamination using a heterogeneous fleet of autonomous surface vehicles. Each vehicle in the fleet possesses a different set of sensors, such as number of sensors and sensor types, which is the definition provided by the authors for a heterogeneous fleet. The AquaHet-PSO consists of three main phases. In the initial phase, the vehicles traverse the water resource to obtain preliminary models of water quality parameters. These models are then utilized in the second phase to identify potential contamination areas and assign vehicles to specific action zones. In the final phase, the vehicles focus on a comprehensive characterization of the parameters. The proposed system combines several techniques, including Particle Swarm Optimization and Gaussian Processes, with the integration of genetic algorithm to maximize the distances between the initial positions of vehicles equipped with identical sensors, and a distributed communication system in the final phase of the AquaHet-PSO. Simulation results in the Ypacarai lake demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of AquaHet-PSO in generating accurate water quality models and detecting contamination peaks. The proposed method demonstrated improvements compared to the lawnmower approach. It achieved a remarkable 17% improvement, on r-squared data, in generating complete models of water quality parameters throughout the lake. In addition, it achieved a 230% improvement in accurate characterization of high pollution areas and a 24% increase in pollution peak detection specifically for heterogeneous fleets equipped with four or more identical sensors.

AB In this paper, the problem of finite-time trajectory tracking control is studied and addressed for a 6 degree of freedom (DOF) autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) subjected to unknown dynamic model, stochastic perturbations, external disturbances (matched and mismatched) and saturation input nonlinearities. Based on the backstepping control approach, novel finite-time control inputs are designed and proposed. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and finite-time adaptation laws are exploited to approximate the nonlinear dynamics of AUV, the stochastic perturbations and the upper bound of external disturbances. To handle the destructive effects of saturation input nonlinearities, finite-time auxiliary system method is utilized. To overcome the explosion of complexity problem of backstepping control strategy, compensator-based finite-time command filter approach is exploited. By utilizing the Lyapunov stability theorem, it is mathematically proven and demonstrated that the suggested nonlinear control inputs are able to guarantee the semi-global finite-time stability in probability (SGFSP) of the closed-loop AUV system. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate and depict the effectiveness and performance of the proposed neuro-adaptive robust finite-time control scheme. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS

DE marine robotics; planning
AB Mission planning for autonomous marine vehicles is nontrivial due to the dynamic and uncertain nature of the marine environment. Communication can be low-bandwidth and is not always guaranteed, so the operator must rely on the vehicles to adjust their plans according to the realized state of the environment. This paper presents the improvements made to an energy-aware mission planner that allows it to generate and adjust plans for an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) operating in an uncertain environment. The energy-aware mission planning problem was redefined as a stochastic programming problem, and a two-stage solver was developed to provide an initial plan for the ASV and then adjust it during run-time according to predefined recourse actions. The mission planner and ASV were trialed in Lake Waverley, Tasmania. Adjusting the recourse action criteria demonstrated that the ASV could exhibit conservative or opportunistic behaviors according to the operator's preference of safety margin. In the pursuit of extending the planner's second-stage so that it can predict a suitable recourse action ahead of time, a hybrid long short-term memory energy forecaster was trained from the Waverley mission data. Comparison of the error between the forecaster and the test data shows that the forecaster has a reliable forecast horizon of about 10 s.

AB In smart cities, unmanned aerial vehicles and self-driving vehicles are gaining increased concern. These vehicles might utilize ultra-reliable telecommunication systems, Internet-based technologies, and navigation satellite services to locate their customers and other team vehicles to plan their routes. Furthermore, the team of vehicles should serve their customers by specified due date efficiently. Coordination between the vehicles might be needed to be accomplished in real-time in exceptional cases, such as after a traffic accident or extreme weather conditions. This paper presents the planning of vehicle routes as a team orienteering problem. In addition, an 'agile' optimization algorithm is presented to plan these routes for drones and other autonomous vehicles. This algorithm combines an extremely fast biased-randomized heuristic and a parallel computing approach.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to transform urban parking. AVs may not require dedicated parking spaces near their destination. Instead, AVs can drive to the optimal parking lot, cruise, or return to the origin after the passenger gets off. Previous research on AV parking strategies has largely overlooked actual trip patterns and road network conditions that can affect the effectiveness and feasibility of these strategies. In this paper, we construct an agent-based simulation model to assess the potential impacts of AVs on urban parking, focusing on new AV parking strategies. Using the real traffic network and trip data of Hangzhou, we assess the impacts on overall network efficiency, personal trip, and parking demand under different AV penetration rates. Results show that AVs could decrease the total parking cost from 23 to 6 RMB and increase parking convenience for both AVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). 21% of AVs will still choose to park, while 70% will return to the origin. On average, each trip with AV will generate an additional zero-occupant distance of 8.8 km, exacerbating the congestion. The findings indicate the benefits and challenges of new AV parking strategies, providing valuable insights for future urban parking planning and policy making.

AB A huge research effort is being spent worldwide by automotive companies and academic institutions for developing vehicles with high levels of autonomy, ranging from advanced driving-assisted systems to fully automated vehicles. Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) has the potential to become a key technology in this context, thanks to its capability to deal with linear and nonlinear systems, manage physical constraints and satisfy multi-objective performance criteria. However, NMPC is based on the on-line solution of a nonconvex optimization problem and this operation may require a high computational cost, compromising its real-time implementation. In this paper, a "fast" data-aided NMPC approach is developed, aimed at trajectory planning and control for autonomous vehicles. In particular, a Set Membership approximation method is used to derive from data tight bounds on the optimal NMPC control law. These bounds are used to restrict the search domain of the underlying NMPC optimization process, allowing a significant reduction of the computation time. The proposed NMPC trajectory planning and control approach is tested in simulation and compared with other state-of-the-art methods, considering different road scenarios.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB (1) Background: The emergence of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is likely to have substantial implications for walking behaviours due to the availability of new transport options and altered physical environments within cities. The aim of this exploratory study was to identify AV-related factors that could affect walking at the population level and strategies to ameliorate any negative effects. (2) Methods: A total of 46 Australian expert stakeholders were interviewed about their perceptions of the potential impacts of AVs on walking behaviours. The interviewees represented government departments (state and federal), non-government organisations (NGOs), private sector companies, peak bodies, and academia. (3) Results: Interviewees expected AVs to have different effects on individuals' ability and motivation to engage in planned versus incidental walking. While those with innate motivation to walk as a form of exercise or leisure may experience enhanced participation opportunities, it appears that incidental walking could be adversely impacted through the availability of convenient AV door-to-door transport options and automated home delivery services that reduce walking related to commuting and shopping. (4) Conclusions: Proactive policy actions are needed to optimize the potential positive impacts of AVs on walking and circumvent the potential negative impacts on valuable incidental walking that constitutes a key component of many people's total physical activity.

AB In this study, we employ the Integrated Choice Latent Variable (ICLV) framework to model the public's intention of using Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) while impaired under the influence of alcohol, medicine, or fatigue. We identify five latent constructs from psychometric indicators that define respondent's perception and attitudes towards AVs which are i) perceived benefits, ii) perceived risks, iii) enjoy driving, iv) wheels public transport attitude, and v) rails public transport attitude. We use these latent variables along with explanatory variables to study user intentions regarding delegation of vehicle control from human driving to autonomous driving. The study uses survey data collected from 1,065 Czech residents between 2017 and 2018. Our findings indicate that user intentions are primarily defined by attitudes rather than sociodemographic attributes. However, the inclusion of both types of variables is crucial in evaluating user intentions. Despite a positive outlook towards AVs, people were found to be reluctant in using AVs while impaired which can be attributed to distrust towards the technology. Our analysis shows that with appropriate efforts from policymakers, the public's attitude can be changed to promote adoption. The efforts will have to be emphasized towards building positive attitudes (such as perceived benefits) and diminishing existing negative attitudes (such as perceived risks).

AB Path tracking system plays a key technology in autonomous driving. The system should be driven accurately along the lane and be careful not to cause any inconvenience to passengers. To address such tasks, this research proposes hybrid tracker based optimal path tracking system. By applying a deep learning based lane detection algorithm and a designated fast lane fitting algorithm, this research developed a lane processing algorithm that shows a match rate with actual lanes with minimal computational cost. In addition, three modified path tracking algorithms were designed using the GPS based path or the vision based path. In the driving system, a match rate for the correct ideal path does not necessarily represent driving stability. This research proposes hybrid tracker based optimal path tracking system by applying the concept of an observer that selects the optimal tracker appropriately in complex road environments. The driving stability has been studied in complex road environments such as straight road with multiple 3-way junctions, roundabouts, intersections, and tunnels. Consequently, the proposed system experimentally showed the high performance with consistent driving comfort by maintaining the vehicle within the lanes accurately even in the presence of high complexity of road conditions. Code will be available in https://github.com/DGIST-ARTIV.

AB This study investigated the development of visual recognition and stereoscopic imaging technology, applying them to the construction of an image processing system for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). For the proposed visual recognition technology, a Hough transform was combined with an optical flow algorithm to detect the linear features and movement speeds of dynamic images; the proposed stereoscopic imaging technique employed a Harris corner detector to estimate the distance of the target. A physical AUV was constructed with a wide-angle lens camera and a binocular vision device mounted on the bow to provide image input. Subsequently, a simulation environment was established in Simscape Multibody and used to control the post-driver system of the stern, which contained horizontal and vertical rudder planes as well as the propeller. In static testing at National Cheng Kung University, physical targets were placed in a stability water tank; the study compared the analysis results obtained from various brightness and turbidity conditions in out-of-water and underwater environments. Finally, the dynamic testing results were combined with a fuzzy controller to output the real-time responses of the vehicle regarding the angles, rates of the rudder planes, and the propeller revolution speeds at various distances.

AB Vehicle-to-vehicle communication is a key technology for achieving increased perception for automated vehicles, where the communication enables virtual sensing by means of sensors in other vehicles. In addition, this technology also allows detection and recognition of objects that are out-of-sight. This paper presents a trust system that allows a cooperative and automated vehicle to make more reliable and safe decisions. The system evaluates the current situation and generates a trust index indicating the level of trust in the environment, the ego vehicle, and the surrounding vehicles. This research goes beyond secure communication and concerns the verification of the received data on a system level. The results show that the proposed method is capable of correctly identifying various traffic situations and how the trust index is used while manoeuvring in a platoon merge scenario.

ID PARALLEL PARKING; PATH
AB For the autonomous parking problem of the tractor-semitrailer vehicle, a piecewise Gauss pseudospectral method is proposed as a trajectory planning scheme in this paper. Firstly, the trajectory planning problem is transformed into an optimal control problem by establishing a vehicle kinematics model for the low-velocity scene, the dynamic constraints including the physical constraints, the collision avoidance constraints, and the endpoint constraints. The optimal control problem are discretized into a nonlinear programming problem by piecewise Gauss pseudospectral method according to the movement area during parking process. The shortest time to complete parking is taken as the objective function. The Gauss pseudospectral method is further adopted to solve the nonlinear programming problem in the two parking stages. Three parallel parking conditions with different lengths of parking spaces and three vertical parking conditions with different widths of parking spaces are set for simulation verification based on Matlab/Simulink. The simulation results show that the proposed method can uniformly and effectively solve the trajectory planning problem of the tractor-semitrailer vehicle. Compared with the traditional pseudospectral method, a shorter parking time and a significantly higher convergence rate can be got with the method, which further indicates that the proposed method has good effectiveness and robustness.

TI A Robust Electric Power-Steering-Angle Controller for Autonomous

SO ELECTRONICS
LA English
DT Article
DE electric power steering; steering angle control; sliding mode control;
   sliding mode observer; autonomous vehicles
AB This paper addresses the challenges associated with steering-angle control of electric power steering for autonomous vehicles, including steering model parameter uncertainty, dependency of self-aligning moment disturbance estimation on tire parameters, and compensation for the asymmetrical hysteresis behavior in the steering system caused by backlash in gears and static friction. A variable gain-sliding mode steering-angle controller is developed to deal with these challenges. Replacing the fixed gain with variable gain in the sliding mode controller solves two problems: it eliminates chattering, and it allows for automatic gain adjustment based on the maneuver and the size of the error, which eliminates the need for gain scheduling. Both fixed and variable gain-sliding mode controllers are derived and compared in simulations to prove the superiority of the variable gain controller. A sliding mode observer is developed to estimate the self-aligning moment disturbance without required information about the tire parameters, which makes it vehicle independent. The observer also treats the static friction as disturbance and estimates it along with any other disturbance, such as driver torque disturbance. The stability of both the controller and the observer is proven using Lyapunov stability theory. Simulation and experimental results proved the robustness of the presented methods to the above challenges.

AB The interest in developing and deploying fully autonomous vehicles on our public roads has come to a full swing. Driverless capabilities, widely spread in modern vehicles through advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), require highly reliable perception features to navigate the environment, being light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors a key instrument in detecting the distance and speed of nearby obstacles and in providing high-resolution 3D representations of the surroundings in real-time. However, and despite being assumed as a game-changer in the autonomous driving paradigm, LiDAR sensors can be very sensitive to adverse weather conditions, which can severely affect the vehicle's perception system behavior. Aiming at improving the LiDAR operation in challenging weather conditions, which contributes to achieving higher driving automation levels defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), this article proposes a weather denoising method called Dynamic light-Intensity Outlier Removal (DIOR). DIOR combines two approaches of the state-of-the-art, the dynamic radius outlier removal (DROR) and the low-intensity outlier removal (LIOR) algorithms, supported by an embedded reconfigurable hardware platform. By resorting to field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology, DIOR can outperform state-of-the-art outlier removal solutions, achieving better accuracy and performance while guaranteeing the real-time requirements.

AB In this paper, a new passivity-based control approach is designed to improve the robustness and stability of autonomous vehicles in performing path-tracking tasks. A port-Hamiltonian model is a special geometric structure and provides a systematic and insightful framework to describe many physical systems from an energy perspective. The passivity-based control establishes a new and simple structure to achieve the path-tracking task by the port-Hamiltonian structure. Firstly, the path-tracking error system is transformed into a port-Hamiltonian system with the perturbation. The energy-shaping method is utilized to ensure the asymptotic stability, and the stability proof of the closed-loop, path-tracking error system is given. The proposed real-time, passivity-based controller is directly dependent on the passive outputs, which is robust to parameter uncertainties caused by load changes. Moreover, the control performance of steering control will be degraded when the steering angle is saturated. The yaw-moment control is introduced to enhance the driving safety. In the wheel torque distribution, an optimization-based control allocation is designed to minimize the sum of tire loads and to make them more evenly distributed to each tire. Finally, simulations are implemented in MATLAB/Simulink and CarSim co-simulation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed strategy under different driving conditions.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES
AB The multiple autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) formation plays an important role in underwater missions, such as oceanographic sampling and water pollution monitoring. This article presents the mechatronic design, modeling, formation control, and experiments of multiple AUVs. The structure of the AUV and a simplified mathematical model for tracking control are described. To achieve formation control, we formulate a control framework for the multiple AUVs. The upper layer is a formation algorithm based on a novel leader-follower control law. The bottom layer is a dynamic controller based on active disturbance rejection control (ADRC). The formation algorithm is in charge of calculating reference values for the followers to maintain a desired pattern with the leader. The stability and convergence properties of the algorithm have been analyzed using the Lyapunov stability method. Meanwhile, an ADRC approach-based dynamic controller is established to track the reference values. Numerical simulations are carried out to analyze formation control and validate the control framework. The multiple AUVs can switch and maintain the formation between the one-line pattern and the V pattern. Finally, extensive formation field experiments involving the one-line pattern and the V pattern show the good motion ability of the self-designed AUVs and also verify the feasibility of the proposed control approach.

AB Fast and accurate visual scene understanding in autonomous vehicles is necessary but still very challenging. An autonomous vehicle must be taught to read the road like a human driver for better controlling the vehicle, so it is important to efficiently detect the road area and road markings. In this paper, we mainly focus on the vanishing point detection and its application in inverse perspective mapping (IPM) for road marking understanding. We first propose a fast and accurate vanishing point detection method for various types of roads, by adopting and improving Weber local descriptor to obtain salient representative texture and orientation information of the road area, and then voting for the dominant vanishing point with a simple line-voting scheme. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed vanishing point detection approach gains a better performance than some state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computation time. Furthermore, we introduce the detected vanishing point into the IPM algorithm in the structured road environment, since some important calibration parameters can be automatically calculated by the vanishing point, especially on the rough road. Experiments also show that our proposed vanishing point-based IPM method is adaptive and accurate, which is conducive to the subsequent road marking detection and recognition.

AB Obstacle detection (OD) for autonomous ground vehicles on highways and in dynamic environments is exceptionally difficult due to the short response time requirements. Many OD systems handle this problem by using sensors with less data or by using powerful processors. However, this problem can be solved using biology-inspired processing without replacing hardware. LiDAR is one of the most common sensor options for OD in autonomous ground vehicles. The importance map, a recently developed biology-inspired processing technique using events, has been able to efficiently highlight LiDAR returns in a scene that correspond to obstacles. Even though the importance map has shown potential, there are three significant flaws: no object movement distinction, high levels of noise, and poor static object tracking. Solutions for these flaws are presented in this research. The constant-angle principle identifies motion toward the ego vehicle, temporal filtering removes noise, and an updated static object-tracking algorithm performs well at various speeds. OD capabilities of the importance map and the previous importance map are compared using LiDAR data from the KITTI data set. Using comparisons between true-positive and false-positive rates, the importance map performs much better than the previous importance map. Furthermore, events are shown to be a highly discriminative feature for finding obstacles in a scene. (c) 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

AB This study presents a domain-specific automated machine learning (AutoML) for risk prediction and behaviour assessment, which can be used in the behavioural decision-making and motion trajectory planning of autonomous vehicles (AVs). The AutoML enables end-to-end machine learning from vehicle movement and sensing data to detailed risk levels and corresponding behaviour characteristics, which integrates three main components of: unsupervised risk identification by surrogate risk indicators and big data clustering, feature learning based on XGBoost, and model auto-tuning by Bayesian optimisation. Then, the functions and performance of AutoML are evaluated based on NGSIM data, with assumptions of various sensing configurations or data acquisition conditions. AutoML achieves satisfactory results of behaviour-based risk prediction, which has a predictive power of 91.7% overall accuracy for four risk levels, and about 95% accuracy for safe-risk distinction. Bayesian optimisation guides the self-learning of AutoML to get the optimised feature subsets and hyperparameter values. The identification of key features not only produces better performance with fewer computation costs, but also provides data-driven insights about AV design, such as sensor configurations and sensor data mining, from risk decision-making perspectives. The application potentials of AutoML in AVs are discussed.

AB The aim of this article is to develop a new cooperative path following control scheme for a team of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) which track one curve with nonlinear uncertainties. Individual path-following controllers are designed to guarantee that each AUV meets the desired tracking performance. For the cooperative path following, a containment control approach is incorporated into the design, where each AUV is forced to evenly disperse on a path that is parameterized by a continuous variable over a communication network. The main features of the paper that unlike the existing designs are that: first, by employing the command filtered control technique, the assumption of second-order derivative of the reference path is removed. Second, a globally uniformly ultimately bounded (GUUB) path following control structure is proposed that enables two kinds of controllers to switch under different cases. Third, coordination between multiple AUVs is achieved through a containment design, and a path variable containment cooperative path following controller is derived that enables multiple AUVs to be evenly dispersed and guided by the virtual leaders. Finally, the stability analysis and simulation example are given to verify the proposed control strategy.

AB Recent decades have witnessed the breakthrough of autonomous vehicles (AVs), and the sensing capabilities of AVs have been dramatically improved. Various sensors installed on AVs will be collecting massive data and perceiving the surrounding traffic continuously. In fact, a fleet of AVs can serve as floating (or probe) sensors, which can be utilized to infer traffic information while cruising around the roadway networks. Unlike conventional traffic sensing methods relying on fixed location sensors or moving sensors that acquire only the information of their carrying vehicle, this paper leverages data from AVs carrying sensors for not only the information of the AVs, but also the characteristics of the surrounding traffic. A high-resolution data-driven traffic sensing framework is proposed, which estimates the fundamental traffic state characteristics, namely, flow, density and speed in high spatio-temporal resolutions and of each lane on a general road, and it is developed under different levels of AV perception capabilities and for any AV market penetration rate. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves high accuracy even with a low AV market penetration rate. This study would help policymakers and private sectors (e.g., Waymo) to understand the values of massive data collected by AVs in traffic operation and management.

AB Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are promised by their developers to transform mobilities, making travel accessible to all - including those unable to drive due to age, affordability or disability - and thereby widen the distribution of what Urry calls 'network capital'. This paper interrogates promotional visualizations about CAVs as they imagine future automated mobilities and the scaling up of the technologies from small trials to mass roll-out. It analyses a wide range of images from a CAV trial in a UK city and demonstrates that these images reinforce rather than disrupt traditional gendered associations of automobility. This study further develops this work and notes other ways in which visualizations of CAV-enabled network mobility reiterate existing network capital inequalities. It also pays careful attention to the background urban environment in which CAVS are pictured. The paper argues that an absence of people and place specificity enable CAV technologies to be imagined as being used in other locations and contexts. Hence the visualizations of CAV that picture only specific forms corporeal mobility also work to envision the mobility of entrepreneurial capital, as the software and hardware behind the driverless vehicle is shown as transferable to, and profitable in, different contexts and situations.

AB This paper investigates three-dimensional target tracking control problem of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) by using coordinates transformation and multi-layer neural networks. The passive-boundedness assumption of sway and heave velocities of underactuated AUVs is used to design a controller in the actuated directions. For this purpose, a new Euler-Lagrange formulation is proposed based on range and bearing tracking errors with respect to a moving target in the body-fixed frame. Then, a tracking controller is proposed to make range and bearing tracking errors converge to zero. Multi-layer neural networks (MLNNs) are utilized to approximate unknown nonlinear-in-parameter dynamics of the system, and adaptive robust control techniques are adopted to compensate for MLNN approximation errors and time-varying environmental disturbances which are induced by waves, wind and ocean currents. The stability of the proposed control system is analysed based on Lyapunov's approach which shows that target tracking errors are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded and exponentially tend to a small neighbourhood around the zero. At the end, simulation examples are given to demonstrate the competency of the proposed target tracking controller.

AB This paper proposes a data-driven learning algorithm for the human-in-the-loop cooperative tracking control of multi-agent systems with completely unknown dynamics. The core role of the human is to supervise a team of agents via sending a control command to only the leader vehicle, where the leader is a non-autonomous agent that has a nonzero but bounded control input receiving the control command from the human operator. To effectively reduce communication frequency among vehicles, a distributed observer only using the relative input-output information is projected to approximate the relative state information of agents. Then, taking the transient state into account instead of the steady-state, a value iteration (VI) algorithm is proposed to solve the optimal output trajectory tracking control without an initial stabilizing control policy but sacrificing the convergence rate. Under the VI algorithm, a mixed iteration (MI) algorithm by making the full advantages of both VI and the traditional policy iteration algorithms is developed, which not only guarantees the convergence rate but also removes the requirement of an initial stabilizing control policy. Finally, a practical multi-robot network is provided to verify and compare the advantages of the proposed theoretical algorithm.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this article is to illustrate how sensors impart perceptive capabilities to robots. This is the second part of a two-part article. This second part considers positional awareness and sensing in the external environment, notably but not exclusively by autonomous, mobile robots.
   Design/methodology/approach - Following a short introduction, this article first discusses positional sensing and navigation by mobile robots, including self-driving cars, automated guided vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). It then considers sensing with UAVs and AUVs, and finally discusses robots for hazard detection. Brief concluding comments are drawn.
   Findings - This shows that sensors based on a multitude of techniques confer navigational capabilities to mobile robots, including LIDARs, radar, sonar, imaging and inertial sensing devices. UAVs, AUVs and mobile terrestrial robots can be equipped with all manner of sensors to create detailed terrestrial and underwater maps, monitor air and water quality, locate pollution and detect hazards. While existing sensors are used widely, many new devices are now being developed to meet specific requirements and to comply with size, weight and cost restraints.
   Originality/value - The use of mobile robots is growing rapidly, and this article provides a timely account of how sensors confer them with positional awareness and allow them to act as mobile sensing platforms.

AB Vehicle and pedestrian detection is one of the critical tasks in autonomous driving. Since heterogeneous techniques have been proposed, the selection of a detection system with an appropriate balance among detection accuracy, speed and memory consumption for a specific task has become very challenging. To deal with this issue and to provide guidance for model selection, this paper analyzes several mainstream object detection architectures, including Faster R-CNN, R-FCN, and SSD, along with several typical feature extractors, such as ResNet50, ResNet101, MobileNet_V1, MobileNet_V2, Inception_V2 and Inception_ResNet_V2. By conducting extensive experiments using the KITTI benchmark, which is a commonly used street dataset, we demonstrate that Faster R-CNN ResNet50 obtains the best average precision (AP) (58%) for vehicle and pedestrian detection, with a speed of 8.6 FPS. Faster R-CNN Inception_V2 performs best for detecting cars and detecting pedestrians respectively (74.5% and 47.3%). ResNet101 consumes the highest memory (9907 MB) and has the largest number of parameters (64.42 millions), and Inception_ResNet_V2 is the slowest model (3.05 FPS). SSD MobileNet_V2 is the fastest model (70 FPS), and SSD MobileNet_V1 is the lightest model in terms of memory usage (875 MB), both of which are suitable for applications on mobile and embedded devices.

AB While impressive progress has recently been made with autonomous vehicles, both indoors and on streets, autonomous localization and navigation in less constrained and more dynamic environments, such as outdoor pedestrian and bicycle-friendly sites, remains a challenging problem. We describe a new approach that utilizes several visual perception modules-place recognition, landmark recognition, and road lane detection-supplemented by proximity cues from a planar laser range finder for obstacle avoidance. At the core of our system is a new hybrid topological/grid-occupancy map that integrates the outputs from all perceptual modules, despite different latencies and time scales. Our approach allows for real-time performance through a combination of fast but shallow processing modules that update the map's state while slower but more discriminating modules are still computing. We validated our system using a ground vehicle that autonomously traversed three outdoor routes several times, each 400 m or longer, on a university campus. The routes featured different road types, environmental hazards, moving pedestrians, and service vehicles. In total, the robot logged over 10 km of successful recorded experiments, driving within a median of 1.37 m laterally of the center of the road, and localizing within 0.97 m (median) longitudinally of its true location along the route.

AB The use of Neural Networks (NN) is necessary to bring the behavior of Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles (IAV) near the human one in recognition, learning, decision-making, and action. First, current navigation approaches based on NN are discussed. Indeed, these current approaches remedy insufficiencies of classical approaches related to real-time, autonomy, and intelligence. Second, a neural navigation approach essentially based on pattern classification to acquire target localization and obstacle avoidance behaviors is suggested. This approach must provide vehicles with capability, after supervised Gradient Backpropagation learning, to recognize both six (06) target location and thirty (30) obstacle avoidance situations using NN1 and NN2 Classifiers, respectively. Afterwards, the decision-making and action consist of two association stages, carried out by reinforcement Trial and Error learning, and their coordination using a NN3. Then, NN3 allows to decide among five (05) actions (move towards 30 degrees, move towards 60 degrees, move towards 90 degrees, move towards 120 degrees, and move towards 150 degrees). Third, simulation results which display the ability of the neural approach to provide IAV with capability to intelligently navigate in partially structured environments are presented. Finally, a discussion dealing with the suggested approach and how it relates to some other works is given.

AB The expectation from automated vehicles has been increasing in recent years. Potential advantages for automated vehicles include driving safety, traffic efficiency, and positive environmental outcomes. To evaluate the extent to which automated vehicles are advantageous against conventional vehicles, this paper presents a simple car-following model, named the linked vehicle model, which reflects the capabilities of automated vehicles and the interaction between adjacent automated vehicles. The idea behind linked vehicle model is inspired by the collective motion of self-propelled particles in nature and the study of vehicle platooning from the Safe Road Trains for the Environment project. Moreover, the model is integrated into a traffic simulator in order to evaluate the performance of automated vehicles in an ideal circumstance. Comparisons with other representative car-following models are also provided, and they show that linked vehicle model achieves both optimal microscopic and macroscopic performance. Simulated results also show that linked vehicle model attains the best fuel economy and the lowest pollutant emissions.

AB Advanced driver assistance systems are an important step on the way towards the autonomous driving. However, there are new challenges in the release of increasingly complex systems. For the testing of those systems many test kilometers are necessary to represent sufficient diversity. Hence, the virtual testing of driver assistance systems brings new opportunities. In virtual environments, it is possible to run a much higher distance in a short time. Simultaneously, the complexity of the environment and the test scenarios are individually adjustable. It is possible to test scenarios that are not feasible in a real environment due to a risk of injury. A big challenge is the physical correct implementation of real vehicles and their components into the Virtual Reality. To enable a realistic virtual testing the vehicles surrounding sensors need to be modeled adequately. Thus, this paper presents an approach for the implementation of a Lidar model into a Virtual Reality. A physical Lidar model is combined with a real-time capable vehicle dynamics model to investigate the influence of vehicle movements to the sensor measurements. The models are implemented into a highly realistic virtual city environment. Finally, a test campaign shows the influence of the Lidars physics and the vehicle dynamics on the detection results.

AB With the application of new technologies in vehicles such as wireless communications, microelectronics, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Vehicles (AV), there are lots of embedded hardware and software in vehicles, and so cryptographic technologies such as block ciphers are also applied to the vehicle system to protect its security and privacy. In order to better find potential security vulnerabilities and improve security of the vehicle system which applied SIMON block cipher, in this paper, a novel Differential fault attack (DFA) method is presented. By inducing a random bit fault in LT-4 (the fourth round from the last), we first demonstrate the process of identifying the fault-induced position. Then, on the basis of the determined position, we describe how to retrieve three rounds of keys by inducing only one round of faults. For retrieving the SIMON family, compared with previous DFAs under the random bit fault model, the lowest numbers of fault-induced and fault locations (or rounds) are required by our attack. In particular, when the key words m is 2 or 3, the proposed attack only needs to induce one round of faults. Finally, we carry out simulation verification and a comparison to illustrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed attack.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are used by the scientific community for various applications, from collecting well-distributed high-quality data to mapping the seafloor or exploring unknown areas. Nonpredictable environmental conditions and sensor acquisitions make the design of AUV surveys challenging even for expert operators. Multiple attempts are required, and the collected data quality is not guaranteed: The AUV passively stores the sensors' acquisitions that are then analyzed offline after its recovery. In Forward-Looking SONAR (FLS) seabed inspections, the vehicle follows lawnmower paths designed by an expert operator that considers the sensor characteristics. The performance of FLSs is affected by several environmental conditions and possible protruding objects. This paper presents a probabilistic framework for FLS-based seabed inspections that endow the AUV with the ability to autonomously conducting the survey and ensure adequate coverage of the target area. A three-dimensional probabilistic occupancy mapping system for FLS reconstructions to update the covered area map was developed. The map is used by the Coverage Path Planning (CPP) algorithm to evaluate the visibility of the viewpoints that are generated as nodes of a random tree. The Next-Best Viewpoint (NBV) is selected as the first node in the branch expected to collect more data, and the path to reach the NBV is computed using the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT*) algorithm. The sensor-driven coverage approach is used in a receding-horizon manner. The proposed Receding-Horizon Coverage Approach was validated with simulations and real prerecorded data. Finally, the framework was used online during an experimental campaign where several FLS seabed inspections were performed.

AB The hull-propeller interaction of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in straight and oblique flow is numerically studied. The study is performed based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and the general commercial software ANSYS Workbench. The multiple reference frames (MRF) method and the shear stress transport (SST) k - ! turbulence model are adopted. Firstly, the drag of Suboff AUV and the open water performance of the Wageningen B-3-50 propeller are simulated numerically. The errors are all within 5%, validating the reliability of the method in this paper. Then, the Sailfish AUV and B-3-35 propeller developed by the Underwater Vehicle Laboratory (UVL) of Ocean University of China are simulated. The maximum incremental drag produced by the appendages reaches even more than 1.5 times the hull drag. Propeller rotation causes an additional hull drag increment of over 25%. With an inlet velocity of 1.5 m/s, the thrust and torque behind the bare hull increase by 16.7% and 6.4%, respectively. The effect of angle of attack on drag is more significant at high velocity. Finally, the numerical simulation result 1.825 m/s and experimental result 1.75 m/s are compared. This study has implications for guidance on AUV integration analysis.

AB The missions being proposed for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), by both marine scientists and industry, are becoming increasingly complex and challenging. In order to meet these demands the next generation of AUVs will need to be faster, to operate for longer durations, and to be more manoeuvrable than existing vehicles. It is therefore vital that the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on a self-propelled manoeuvring AUV can be predicted accurately at the initial design stage. In order to achieve this, the use of a computational-fluid-dynamics-based analysis is suggested. The approaches developed are predominantly steady state and suitable for running on a workstation personal computer using a commercial software licence. It is estimated that the proposed simulations would take a competent user less than 1 month for a new concept design. The total cost of these simulations is significantly lower than the cost of building a model and having it commercially tested to capture the same level of detail for the resistance, propulsion, and manoeuvring performance. Based on the validation studies presented, it is estimated that on a 2 x 10(6) element structured mesh a competent user should be able to predict hydrodynamic forces to within at least 10 per cent and moments to within 20 per cent of in-service performance.

AB With the rapid development of the UAV, it is widely used in rescue and disaster relief, where autonomous landing is the key technology. Vision-based autonomous landing has the advantages of strong autonomy, low cost, and strong anti-interference ability. Moreover, vision navigation has higher guidance and positioning accuracy combined with other navigation methods, such as GPS/INS. This paper summarizes the research results in the field of vision-based autonomous landing for the UAV, and divides it into static, dynamic, and complex scenarios according to the type of landing destination. Among them, the static scenario includes two categories: cooperative targets and natural landmarks; the dynamic scenario is divided into two categories: vehicle-based autonomous landing and ship-based autonomous landing. The key technologies are summarized, compared, and analyzed and the future development trends are pointed out, which can provide a reference for the research on vision-based autonomous landing of UAVs.

AB As we all know, target detection and tracking are of great significance for marine exploration and protection. In this paper, we propose one Convolutional-Neural-Network-based target detection method named YOLO-Softer NMS for long-strip target detection on the water, which combines You Only Look Once (YOLO) and Softer NMS algorithms to improve detection accuracy. The traditional YOLO network structure is improved, the prediction scale is increased from threeto four, and a softer NMS strategy is used to select the original output of the original YOLO method. The performance improvement is compared totheFaster-RCNN algorithm and traditional YOLO methodin both mAP and speed, and the proposed YOLO-Softer NMS's mAP reaches 97.09%while still maintaining the same speed as YOLOv3. In addition, the camera imaging model is used to obtain accurate target coordinate information for target tracking. Finally, using the dicyclic loop PID control diagram, the Autonomous Surface Vehicle is controlled to approach the long-strip target with near-optimal path design. The actual test results verify that our long-strip target detection and tracking method can achieve gratifying long-strip target detection and tracking results.

AB This paper proposes a distributed finite-time velocity-free robust formation control scheme for multiple underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) under switching directed topologies in the presence of uncertain dynamics and unknown time-varying external disturbances. Here, a novel finite-time velocity observer is created for each AUV to estimate its neighbors' velocities within a finite time so that only its neighbors' positions need to be transmitted, which reduces the communication burden between AUVs. Then, a super-twisting extended state observer is constructed for each AUV to estimate its total disturbances lumped by the uncertain dynamics and the unknown time-varying external disturbances, whose estimation errors can converge to zero within a finite time. Further, a distributed finite-time velocity-free robust formation control law is proposed incorporating the above into the nonsingular terminal sliding mode technique. Theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that the proposed formation control law can make the multiple AUVs achieve the desired formation pattern while guaranteeing the formation errors converge to zero within a finite time.

ID PROTOCOLS; PRIORITY
AB Many accidents and serious problems occur on the road due to the rapid increase in traffic congestion in all sections of the country. Autonomous vehicles provide a solution to successfully and cost-effectively avoid this problem while minimizing user disruption. Currently, more engaging electromechanical elements with an analog interface are used to develop affordable automobiles for efficient and cost-effective operation for a smart driving platform with a semiautonomous automobile, strengthening the vehicle involvement of the driver while increasing safety. As a result, it takes longer for various car elements to respond, which causes more problems during message transmission. This project aims to create a Controller Area Network (CAN) for analyzing message response times by incorporating a few application nodes on the IoT platform, such as an antilock braking system, flexible cruise control, and seat belt section, for some real-time control system applications. These application nodes are car analytical parts that are linked to IoT modules to prevent collisions. An autonomous device for collision avoidance and obstacle detection in a vehicle can impact road accidents if the CAN protocol is implemented.

AB Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs), which have several potential benefits, are an emerging innovative technology in the market. However, the successful operation of SAVs largely depends on the extent of travellers' intention to adopt them. This study aims to analyse the factors that influence the adoption of SAVs by integrating two theoretical perspectives: the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) and the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). A valid survey sample of 268 participants in Da Nang, Vietnam was collected. Subsequently, structural equation modelling was deployed to test the research model. The results indicate that the five dimensions of UTUAT2: performance expectation, effort expectation, habit, price value and hedonic motivation, are mediated by the attitudes toward using SAVs. Further, the TPB constructs, namely attitude, subject norm, perceived behavioural control, along with its perceived facilitating conditions, are all effective predictors of intention to use SAVs. The findings of this study can serve as a crucial resource for transport operators and the government to enhance transportation services and policies.

   Positioning performance
AB Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) have been researched extensively for solving traffic issues and for realising the concept of an intelligent transport system. A well-developed positioning system is critical for CAVs to achieve these aims. The system should provide high accuracy, mobility, continuity, flexibility and scalability. However, high-performance equipment is too expensive for the commercial use of CAVs; therefore, the use of a low-cost Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver to achieve real-time, high-accuracy and ubiquitous positioning performance will be a future trend. This research used RTKLIB software to develop a low-cost GNSS receiver positioning system and assessed the developed positioning system according to the requirements of CAV applications. Kinematic tests were conducted to evaluate the positioning performance of the low-cost receiver in a CAV driving environment based on the accuracy requirements of CAVs. The results showed that the low-cost receiver satisfied the "Where in Lane" accuracy level (0 center dot 5 m) and achieved a similar positioning performance in rural, interurban, urban and motorway areas.

DE Autonomous surface vehicle; Path following; Serret-Frenet coordinate
   frame; Underactuated
AB Autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) have been widely used for military, civilian and academic applications because of their low developing costs and high executing efficiency. This paper investigates the path following control problem for a low-cost ASV without velocity measurement and feedback control. A Serret-Frenet coordinate frame, which originates at a reference point on the reference path, is utilized to describe path following errors and the corresponding dynamic model. The reference point moves along the path with a designed rate, which produces an additional control input to solve the singularity problem presented in the classic method. The moving velocity of the reference point and the desired yaw angle are appropriately designed to ensure the path following errors to be globally asymptotically stable with the estimated velocity and side-slip angle by using an adaptation mechanism. The steering control of ASVs is designed using an adaptive sliding mode control technique by dealing with the uncertain parameters in yaw dynamics. The simulations and experiments with linear and circular reference paths demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed path following controller.

AB Electric vehicles (EVs) still have relatively long and frequent charging cycles. Moreover, charging resources are typically limited and must therefore be used efficiently. The V-Charge project has the vision to provide a solution by combining autonomous valet parking with e-mobility, introducing improved parking and charging comfort. V-Charge proposes a solution for charging autonomous EVs in parking places and efficiently using scarce charging resources, thus simplifying the life of the customer and increasing the feasibility of EVs. For the management of parking lots and charging resources, V-Charge provides a server back end and a communication infrastructure. In this paper, we present our design of scheduling concepts for a coordinated charging strategy that is implemented by this back end. Through intensive simulations, we show that the V-Charge server is able to efficiently handle realistic parking volume and performs well in fulfilling customer requirements, e. g., energy demand for the next driving tasks. Moreover, we evaluate the suitability of various scheduling strategies in different usage scenarios. For the simulation setup, real-world parking statistics obtained from Hamburg Airport and the City of Braunschweig, Germany, are used.

SO COMPUTER NETWORKS

DT Article
DE Underwater acoustic sensor networks; Autonomous underwater vehicle;
   Localization; Position uncertainty
AB Localization underwater has been known to be challenging due to the limited accessibility of the Global Positioning System (GPS) to obtain absolute positions. This becomes more severe in the under-ice environment since the ocean surface is covered with ice, making it more difficult to access GPS or to deploy localization infrastructure. In this paper, a novel solution that minimizes localization uncertainty and communication overhead of under-ice Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) is proposed. Existing underwater localization solutions generally rely on reference nodes at ocean surface or on localization infrastructure to calculate positions, and they are not able to estimate the localization uncertainty, which may lead to the increase of localization error. In contrast, using the notion of external uncertainty (i.e., the position uncertainty as seen by others), our solution can characterize an AUV's position with a probability model. This model is further used to estimate the uncertainty associated with our proposed localization techniques. Based on this uncertainty estimate, we further propose algorithms to minimize localization uncertainty and communication overhead. Our solution is emulated and compared against existing solutions, showing improved performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The target of reducing travel time only is insufficient to support the development of future smart transportation systems. To align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDG), a further reduction of fuel and emissions, improvements of traffic safety, and the ease of infrastructure deployment and maintenance should also be considered. Different from existing work focusing on optimizing the control in either traffic light signal (to improve the intersection throughput), or vehicle speed (to stabilize the traffic), this paper presents a multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) system called CoTV, which Cooperatively controls both Traffic light signals and Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAV). Therefore, our CoTV can well balance the reduction of travel time, fuel, and emissions. CoTV is also scalable to complex urban scenarios by cooperating with only one CAV that is nearest to the traffic light controller on each incoming road. This avoids costly coordination between traffic light controllers and all possible CAVs, thus leading to the stable convergence of training CoTV under the large-scale multi-agent scenario. We describe the system design of CoTV and demonstrate its effectiveness in a simulation study using SUMO under various grid maps and realistic urban scenarios with mixed-autonomy traffic.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have the potential to generate socioeconomic benefits by reducing commute times, accidents and energy consumption. Ergonomists have foreseen the future of these vehicles as comfortable pods where the passengers will be watching movies, reading or simply relaxing. Motion Sickness (MS) is thought to be a human comfort issue which needs to be addressed to enable such a vision. The present study endeavours to address this issue by firstly proposing three algorithms for mitigating MS during various manoeuvres, namely: (1) Single Lane Change (SLC), (2) Double Lane Change (DLC) and (3) Cornering. This is done in 3 phases; phase 1 is the identification of coordinates using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), phase 2 is the MS-free block that minimizes MS, and the last phase is shaping and symmetry block for minimizing postural instability and maximizing handling comfort. This is believed to be the first time an ultimate motion sickness mitigating algorithm is introduced. The second proposed solution is a control strategy to ensure real-time adaptive MS reduction while the AV is on the move with the help of modern & traditional controllers. Ultimately, The proposed hybrid solution is compared against other recent studies, with results illustrating a substantial MS reduction in AV's of about 75%.

AB Due to the confined span of parking location choice for human-driven vehicles (HVs), the spatiotemporal imbalance in parking space utilization has always been a challenging problem in many major cities, leading to a substantial waste of precious land resources. However, in the era of autonomous vehicles (AVs) with parking autonomy, there are more alternative parking options available as AV can park at more distant locations away from the trip maker's destination. This paper aims to investigate the morning commute problem with consideration of AV commuters' distant parking choices in a many-to-one network. Parking sharing scheme is explicitly consid-ered, wherein AV travellers can choose to park at city centre at public parking facilities and then lease their own parking space out, park at home, or park at a shared parking space. We first examine how AV commuters in different residential clusters prioritize their parking location choices, as well as their willingness to share the vacant parking space. Then, we investigate the travellers' trip timing decisions and determine the resultant equilibrium travel pattern. Without other dynamic managing schemes, the model results indicate that appropriate CBD parking supply, together with differentiated parking charges/subsidy, can reduce the total queueing congestion significantly, yet at the cost of higher total travel cost.

AB This article proposes a field application of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) control system for solving the action selection problem of an autonomous robot in a cable tracking task. The Ictineu Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) learns to perform a visual based cable tracking task in a two step learning process. First, a policy is computed by means of simulation where a hydrodynamic model of the vehicle simulates the cable following task. The identification procedure follows a specially designed Least Squares (LS) technique. Once the simulated results are accurate enough, in a second step, the learnt-in-simulation policy is transferred to the vehicle where the learning procedure continues in a real environment, improving the initial policy. The Natural Actor-Critic (NAC) algorithm has been selected to solve the problem. This Actor-Critic (AC) algorithm aims to take advantage of Policy Gradient (PG) and Value Function (VF) techniques for fast convergence. The work presented contains extensive real experimentation. The main objective of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of RL techniques to learn autonomous underwater tasks, the selection of a cable tracking task is motivated by an increasing industrial demand in a technology to survey and maintain underwater structures.

AB In research on the navigation and control of an Autonomous Land Vehicle (ALV), the ultrasonic obstacle detection system plays an important role extending the environment cognition capability of the ALV. With a goal of improving the accuracy of ultrasonic obstacle detection, a dynamic data filtering method based on ultrasonic array is presented. The sonar return data is first processed through static filtering according to the geometric relationship of the ultrasonic array. Then, dynamic filtering is executed using the orientation and trajectory information of the vehicle. The dynamic filtering method is compared to the traditional ultrasonic obstacle detection method, which is the static filtering method in a typical field environment. The experiment result demonstrates the validity of the method for solving the fake data problem, and the accuracy of obstacle detection is improved.

The goal in developing the testbed is to enable web-based integration of high-fidelity simulators of heterogeneous autonomous undersea vehicles from multiple organizations and a variety of on-board and fixed sensors in a realistic ocean environment in order to formulate and evaluate intelligent control strategies for mission execution. A formal control language facilitates real-time interactions between heterogeneous autonomous components. A simulation experiment is described that demonstrates multistage inferencing and decision/control strategies for spatio-temporal coordination and multilayered adaptation of group behavior in response to evolving environmental physics or operational dynamics.

AB This paper provides a systematic state of the art review on tracking the fine scale movements of fish with the use of autonomous maritime robotics. Knowledge of migration patterns and the localization of specific species of fish at a given time is vital to many aspects of conservation. This paper reviews these technologies and provides insight into what systems are being used and why. The review results show that a larger amount of complex systems that use a deep learning techniques are used over more simplistic approaches to the design. Most results found in the study involve Autonomous Underwater Vehicles, which generally require the most complex array of sensors. The results also provide insight into future research such as methods involving swarm intelligence, which has seen an increase in use in recent years. This synthesis of current and future research will be helpful to research teams working to create an autonomous vehicle with intentions to track, navigate or survey.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; TRACKING CONTROL; COMPLEMENTARY; UAV
AB This paper presents the design of a complete control system for the autonomous landing of unmanned flybarless helicopters on known stationary visual landmarks. A state estimator based on the complementary filters notion, estimates the position, translational velocity and attitude vectors of the vehicle by fusing data acquired from the on-board camera and an Inertial Measurement Unit. A vision-aided nonlinear model predictive controller is designed for the landing motion of the helicopter, assuming that the on-board camera is rigidly (i.e., no additional Degrees of Freedom (DOF)) attached on the vehicle. Although the under-actuated character of the helicopter dynamics introduces counter-goals for minimizing the error between the vehicle and the landmark, the proposed control scheme guarantees, via hard nonlinear constraints, that the landmark will always be kept inside the camera field of view during the landing procedure. In order to simplify the derived algorithm without violating the robustness of the proposed controller, we reformulate the translational helicopter dynamics in order to reduce the number of the unknown model parameters to a minimum. Moreover, a parameter/disturbance observer is designed for estimating simultaneously the vehicle's unknown dynamic parameters as well as the induced disturbances. The efficacy of the proposed landing scheme is evaluated via a set of experimental and simulation results, using a small-scale flybarless helicopter.

AB The accurate estimation of the State of Charge (SOC) and an acceptable prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of batteries in autonomous vehicles are essential for safe and lifetime optimized operation. The estimation of the expected RUL is quite helpful to reduce maintenance cost, safety hazards, and operational downtime. This paper proposes an innovative health-aware control approach for autonomous racing vehicles to simultaneously control it to the driving limits and to follow the desired path based on maximization of the battery RUL. To deal with the non-linear behavior of the vehicle, a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) model is developed. Based on this model, a robust controller is designed and synthesized by means of the Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) approach, where the general objective is to maximize progress on the track subject to win racing and saving energy. The main contribution of the paper consists in preserving the lifetime of battery and optimizing a lap time to achieve the best path of a racing vehicle. The control design is divided into two layers with different time scale, path planner and controller. The first optimization problem is related to the path planner where the objective is to optimize the lap time and to maximize the battery RUL to obtain the best trajectory under the constraints of the circuit. The proposed approach is formulated as an optimal on-line robust LMI based Model Predictive Control (MPC) that steered from Lyapunov stability. The second part is focused on a controller gain synthesis solved by LPV based on Linear Quadratic Regulator (LPV-LQR) problem in LMI formulation with integral action for tracking the trajectory. The proposed approach is evaluated in simulation and results show the effectiveness of the proposed planner for optimizing the lap time and especially for maximizing the battery RUL.

AB This field report presents an overview of the development and testing of a semi-autonomous underwater vehicle (sAUV). The work presented here is aimed at bridging the gap between current remotely operated vehicles and autonomous research platforms by developing shared autonomy capabilities for low-cost underwater vehicles. We use commercially available components and open-source software interfaces to provide a wider range of capabilities for underwater autonomy research at a lower cost than previously available systems. We describe the overall structure of the system, discuss its capabilities, and provide results demonstrating system performance. We place particular emphasis on shared autonomy, where a human operator is assisted in controlling an underwater tethered vehicle. We present three capabilities developed for the sAUV: (a) an assisted control mode that provides a variable level of assistance using an on-line estimate of user skill level, (b) a planner to generate paths that avoid tether entanglement, and (c) a sonar processing algorithm that identifies informative sonar images for selecting features for 3D scene reconstruction. The vehicle has been deployed on five off-shore and near-shore marine field deployments since 2015, and this report includes selected results from four of those trials to demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of the sAUV system.

AB Littering is a significant challenge for environmental sustainability and a major burden for cities and densely populated areas. Current solutions for litter monitoring, such as litter watch campaigns and city-operated litter collection, are costly and challenging to conduct at a large scale. This article presents a vision for using autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) for litter monitoring and removal and introduces a mechanism for AGVs that uses thermal dissipation resulting from sunlight to identify and remove litter objects. We identify and highlight key challenges for deploying the envisioned solution on a city scale, and demonstrate the feasibility of the solution through extensive experiments.

AB Non-signalized intersections have only ever been suitable for low traffic flow; however, with the development of autonomous driving technology and new control methods, the operation efficiency of this kind of intersection may be improved. In view of the shortcomings of existing non-signalized intersection control methods in multilane situations and inspired by railway trains, an interlocking-block intersection control model is proposed. In this study, vehicles between parallel lanes are combined into a few combos, and the combo shape can be determined according to a pairing model and the interlocking angle range, and the gaps between the front and rear vehicles are simulated as blocks in a railway system, which are added into the intersection control model as virtual blocked cars (VBCs) for optimization. In setting the optimization objectives, the connotation and realization of fairness are discussed. Experimental results show that compared with signalized intersections, roundabouts, and non-signalized intersections without control, the interlocking-block intersection control model greatly reduces vehicle delay. Compared with an existing model, the calculation speed in a multilane situation has been greatly improved, while the vehicle delay is similar.

AB This paper presents an overview of a new dual-radio autopilot and ground station platform used in hierarchical, micro aerial vehicle flocks to improve communication flexibility and performance. Flocks of micro/miniature aerial vehicles flying in close proximity are often used in scenarios of hazard detection and tracking. Micro aerial vehicle's small size grants a number of benefits, such as improved maneuverability and reduced cost, but also results in sometimes severe resource constraints. To help alleviate these restrictions, as well as to improve overall communication flexibility, this paper proposes the use of a hierarchical, dual-radio autopilot flock configuration. Interflock communication is facilitated by low-power radios, whereas an elected flock leader relays important communications to a ground station via a long-range, high-power radio. Additionally, the diversity provided by the dual-radio system provides inherent redundancy while improving flock communication adaptability for varying data sizes and transmit distances. An energy efficiency model for this dual-radio configuration is also presented and verified by autonomous, multi-vehicle flight tests.

AB Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) can receive various information from surrounding vehicles through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication technologies and adjust their car-following behaviour accordingly. Although several studies have evaluated the impact of CAVs on traffic flow stability in a small segment of networks, most approaches are focused on their specific applications considering the trajectory information, and there is a lack of studies analyzing the impact of CAVs on a large-scale network. This paper proposes a novel viscous continuum traffic model considering the anticipation of space headway, the throttle angle, and brake torque information during cooperative car-following. The methods employed to develop the new car-following model and its counterpart continuum traffic model have been described. The linear and non-linear stability analyses of the newly developed model have been conducted to obtain the critical stability factors in small perturbations. Numerical simulations have been carried out to investigate the effect of the anticipation, the throttle angle, and brake torque information on traffic stability, fuel consumption, and exhaust emissions. The numerical results reveal that the anticipation of space headway and the transmission of the throttle angle and brake torque information during cooperative car-following manoeuvres can improve the traffic flow stability and reduce fuel consumption and emissions.

AB This paper investigates the path-tracking control issue for autonomous ground vehicles with the integral sliding mode control (ISMC) considering the transient performance improvement. The path-tracking control is converted into the yaw stabilization problem, where the sideslip-angle compensation is adopted to reduce the steady-state errors, and then the yaw-rate reference is generated for the path-tracking purpose. The lateral velocity and roll angle are estimated with the measurement of the yaw rate and roll rate. Three contributions have been made in this paper: first, to enhance the estimation accuracy for the vehicle states in the presence of the parametric uncertainties caused by the lateral and roll dynamics, a robust extended Kalman filter is proposed based on the minimum model error algorithm; second, an improved adaptive radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) considering the approximation error adaptation is developed to compensate for the uncertainties caused by the vertical motion; third, the RBFNN and composite nonlinear feedback (CNF) based ISMC is developed to achieve the yaw stabilization and enhance the transient tracking performance considering the input saturation of the front steering angle. The overall stability is proved with Lyapunov function. Finally, the superiority of the developed control strategy is verified by comparing with the traditional CNF with high-fidelity CarSim-MATLAB simulations.

AB Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) are a promising first-mile mode to access public transportation. This study focuses on the mode choice analysis assuming that SAVs are introduced in Bangkok, Thailand. Stated preference experiments based on efficient design were conducted. The rescaled logit model was obtained from the nested logit trick on the combined revealed-preference and stated-preference data. The results showed that with the introduction of SAVs, the shares of existing taxi, motorcycle taxi (MC), and light public transit (LPT) modes will decrease by approximately 28.24%, 27.50% and 21.93%, respectively. These indicate that people who are accustomed to using taxi and MC as their first-mile services are respectively most likely and second-most likely to change their choices to SAVs. The values of times for income groups were estimated. Service providers should consider reducing travel cost to attract more lower-income users, and reducing travel time to attract more higher-income users. The average elasticities and simulation results imply that the improvement of the travel cost of SAVs should be a priority over travel time in order to effectively attract more individuals to the SAVs mode, and the improvement of travel time of SAVs leads to the greatest shift from taxi and MC.

AB This paper presents a hybrid route-path planning model for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle's task assignment and management while the AUV is operating through the variable littoral waters. Several prioritized tasks distributed in a large scale terrain is defined first; then, considering the limitations over the mission time, vehicle's battery, uncertainty and variability of the underlying operating field, appropriate mission timing and energy management is undertaken. The proposed objective is fulfilled by incorporating a route-planner that is in charge of prioritizing the list of available tasks according to available battery and a path-planer that acts in a smaller scale to provide vehicle's safe deployment against environmental sudden changes. The synchronous process of the task assign-route and path planning is simulated using a specific composition of Differential Evolution and Firefly Optimization (DEFO) Algorithms. The simulation results indicate that the proposed hybrid model offers efficient performance in terms of completion of maximum number of assigned tasks while perfectly expending the minimum energy, provided by using the favorable current flow, and controlling the associated mission time. The Monte-Carlo test is also performed for further analysis. The corresponding results show the significant robustness of the model against uncertainties of the operating field and variations of mission conditions.

AB Environmental awareness and technological advancements for self-driving cars are close to making autonomous vehicles (AV) a reality in everyday scenarios and a part of smart cities' transportation systems. The perception of safety and trust towards AVs of passengers and other agents in the urban scenario, being pedestrians, cyclists, scooter drivers or car drivers, is of primary importance and the theme of investigation of many research groups. Driver-to-driver communication channels as much as car-to-driver human-machine interfaces (HMI) are well established and part of normal training and experience. The situation is different when users must cope with driverless and autonomous vehicles, both as passengers and as agents sharing the same urban domain. This research focuses on the new challenges of connected driverless vehicles, investigating an emerging topic, namely the language of driving (LoD) between these machines and humans participating in traffic scenarios. This work presents the results of a field study conducted at Tallinn University Technology campus with the ISEAUTO autonomous driving shuttle, including interviews with 176 subjects communicating using LoD. Furthermore, this study combines expert focus group interviews to build a joint base of needs and requirements for AVs in public spaces. Based on previous studies and questionnaire results, we established the hypotheses that we can enhance physical survey results using experimental scenarios with VR/AR tools to allow the fast prototyping of different external and internal HMIs, facilitating the assessment of communication efficacy, evaluation of usability, and impact on the users. The aim is to point out how we can enhance AV design and LoD communications using XR tools. The scenarios were chosen to be inclusive and support the needs of different demographics while at the same time determining the limitations of surveys and real-world experimental scenarios in LoD testing and design for future pilots.

AB Nowadays, how to enhance the maneuverability of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is an important issue in the domain of international navigation in that most AUVs just have a single function of underwater navigation or submarine movement, while the design of thrusters is the key of solving the problem. The multi-moving state autonomous underwater vehicle in this paper can achieve four functions, such as wheels, legs, thrust, and course control depend on the characteristics of spatial deflexion and continual circumgyratetion of the flexible transmission shaft. A new wheel propeller for the multi-moving state autonomous underwater vehicle is presented through analyzing the mechanical characteristics of the ducted propeller and the contracted and loaded tip (CLT) propeller. Then the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method is used to simulate numerically different propellers open-water performance by using the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and Reynolds stress model (RSM) based on sub-domains hybrid meshes. The predicted thrust coefficients, torque coefficients and pressure of the propellers agree well with the experimental data of their open-water performance. The good consistency shows that the numerical method has good accuracy in the prediction of propeller open-water performance, which guides to design the wheel propeller. Moreover, for the sake of ensuring the security and stability of the AUV when it is moving on the ground, finite element method is used to simulate numerically the intensity and vibration characteristics. The proposed final wheel propeller D4-70 (WPD4-70) has preferable open-water performance and intensity characteristics, which can realize the agile maneuverability of the multi-moving state autonomous underwater vehicle.

AB In this paper, the autonomous landing of the parafoil used for aerial vehicles is investigated through the numerical approach. The coupled parafoil-vehicle dynamics model is developed based on the multibody method. The transition process from aircraft flight to parafoil glide is designed in a global system framework. To deal with large flexible deformations during the deployment process, the parafoil canopy is approximated as interacting symmetric subparts using the geometric division method. The pseudo-spectral method is employed to generate a reference trajectory for the landing target. As the system dynamics are introduced into constraint conditions, the generated trajectory is beneficial to improve landing precision. In addition, other optimization objectives, including minimal energy consumption and obstacle avoidance, are considered in trajectory planning. The enhanced proportional integral control is designed to follow the reference trajectory. The neural network inversion model is used to reduce the coupling effect between the longitudinal and the directional control channels. There is a coupling effect that the two controls both are implemented through left and right trailing-edge deflections. An adaptive output allocation method is proposed to ensure that the directional control always is effective in particular when one side reaches saturation. Finally, simulations for autonomous landing under different conditions are carried out to validate the integrated system.

AB The Smart city is important for sustainability. Governments engaged in developing urban mobility in the smart city need to invest their limited financial resources wisely to realize sustainability goals. A key area for such sustainability investment is how to implement and invest in emerging technologies for urban mobility solutions. However, current frameworks on how to understand the impact of emerging technologies aligned with long-term sustainability strategies are understudied. This article develops a simulation-based comparison between different cities and autonomous vehicle (AV) adoption scenarios to understand which aspects of cities lead to positive AV implementation outcomes. As urban mobility and cities will become smart, the analysis represents a first attempt to explore the impact of AVs on a large scale across different cities around the world. Archetypes are formed and account for most, if not all, world cities. For three of our archetypes (car-centric giants, prosperous innovation centers, and high-density megacities), promoting AV-shuttle use would deliver the greatest advantage as measured by improvements in the model's KPIs. To develop urban powerhouses, however, micromobility would deliver greater benefits. For highly compact middleweights, a shift from private cars to other non-AV modes of transportation would be the smartest choice.

AB In this paper, under unforeseen circumstances, a dynamics-constrained global-local (DGL) hybrid path planning scheme incorporating global path planning and local hierarchical architecture is created for an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) with constrained dynamics. By encapsulating ASV safety area into Theta*-like heuristics, global path planning algorithm is developed to optimally generate sparse waypoints which are sufficiently clear to constraints. To deal with dynamically unforeseen environments, a local hierarchy is established by fuzzy decision-making (FDM) and fine dynamic window (FDW) layers, which are responsible for large- and close-range collision avoidance, respectively, by governing surge and yaw velocity guidance signals. With the aid of the FDW, constrained dynamics pertaining to the ASV, i.e., actuatable surge/yaw velocities and accelerations, are elaboratively embedded into local path planning, which in turn governs trackable collision-avoidance local path. By inserting virtual waypoints onto the globally optimal path, a seamless interface between global and local path-planning mechanism is devised, and thereby contributing to the entire DGL hybrid path planning scheme. Simulations and comparisons in various real-world geographies demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed DGL hybrid path planning scheme.

AB Attitude perception for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is a challenging task. Most of existing sensor systems are unable to detect the navigation attitude of AUVs while at the same time to identify the attitude geometric parameters. In order to bridge this research gap, a new artificial lateral line sensor (ALLS) system based on a pressure sensor array is proposed to perform pitch motion perception for AUVs. First of all, a boxfish-like robot was constructed based on the geometrical morphology of a boxfish. The proposed ALLS system was fabricated in the fish robot. Then sensing experiments in the conditions of different pitch motions of the robot were conducted and the experimental measurements were compared with numerical simulation results. The comparison showed consistent mechanisms between the numerical bionic sensor model and the ALLS in perceiving the pitch attitude of the fish robot. Subsequently, pressure measurements of the fish robot were processed by popular machine learning algorithms such as random forest and artificial neural network to establish a vehicle pitch identification model. The analysis results demonstrate that the developed ALLS system is effective in pitch motion parameters recognition, which may provide a new way for self-attitude perception and adjustment of AUVs.

AB Underwater communication cables transport large amounts of sensitive information between countries. This fact converts these cables into a critical infrastructure that must be protected. Monitoring the underwater cable environment is rare and any intervention is usually driven by cable faults. In the last few years, several reports raised issues about possible future malicious attacks on such cables. The main objective of this operational research and analysis (ORA) paper is to present an overview of different commercial and already available marine sensor technologies (acoustic, optic, magnetic and oceanographic) that could be used for autonomous monitoring of the underwater cable environment. These sensors could be mounted on different autonomous platforms, such as unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) or autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). This paper analyses a multi-threat sabotage scenario where surveying a transatlantic cable of 13,000 km, (reaching water depths up to 4000 m) is necessary. The potential underwater threats identified for such a scenario are: divers, anchors, fishing trawls, submarines, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and AUVs. The paper discusses the capabilities of the identified sensors to detect such identified threats for the scenario under study. It also presents ideas on the construction of periodic and permanent surveillance networks. Research study and results are focused on providing useful information to decision-makers in charge of designing surveillance capabilities to secure underwater communication cables.

AB This study is the first in the literature to model the joint equilibrium of departure time and parking location choices when commuters travel with autonomous vehicles (AVs). With AVs, walking from parking spaces to the work location is not needed. Instead, AVs will drop off the commuters at the workplace and then drive themselves to the parking spaces. In this context, the equilibrium departure/arrival profile is different from the literature with non-autonomous vehicles (non-AVs). Besides modeling the commuting equilibrium, this study further develops the first-best time-dependent congestion tolling scheme to achieve the system optimum. Also, a location-dependent parking pricing scheme is developed to replace the tolling scheme. Furthermore, this study discusses the optimal parking supply to minimize the total system cost (including both the travel cost and the social cost of parking supply) under either user equilibrium or system optimum traffic flow pattern. It is found that the optimal planning of parking can be different from the non-AV situation, since the vehicles can drive themselves to parking spaces that are further away from the city center and walking of commuters is avoided. This paper sheds light on future parking supply planning and traffic management.

AB Lane estimation for autonomous driving can be formulated as a curve estimation problem, where local sensor data provides partial and noisy observations of spatial curves forming lane boundaries. The number of lanes to estimate are initially unknown and many observations may be outliers or false detections (due e.g. to shadows or non-boundary road paint). The challenges lie in detecting lanes when and where they exist, and updating lane estimates as new observations are made.
   This paper describes an efficient probabilistic lane estimation algorithm based on a novel curve representation. The key advance is a principled mechanism to describe many similar curves as variations of a single basis curve. Locally observed road paint and curb features are then fused to detect and estimate all nearby travel lanes. The system handles roads with complex multi-lane geometries and makes no assumptions about the position and orientation of the vehicle with respect to the roadway.
   We evaluate our algorithm using a ground truth dataset containing manually-labeled, fine-grained lane geometries for vehicle travel in two large and diverse datasets that include more than 300,000 images and 44 km of roadway. The results illustrate the capabilities of our algorithm for robust lane estimation in the face of challenging conditions and unknown roadways.

AB With the rapid advancement of technology and multimedia systems, ensuring security has become a critical concern. Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are vulnerable to various hacking techniques, including jamming and spoofing. Global Positioning System (GPS) location spoofing poses a significant threat to CAVs, compromising their security and potentially endangering pedestrians and drivers. To address this issue, this research proposes a novel methodology that uses deep learning (DL) algorithms, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), to protect CAVs from GPS location spoofing attacks. The proposed solution is validated using real-time simulations in the CARLA simulator, and extensive analysis of different learning algorithms is conducted to identify the most suitable approach across three distinct trajectories. Training and testing data include GPS coordinates, spoofed coordinates, and localization algorithm values. The proposed machine learning algorithm achieved 99% and 96% accuracy for the best and worst case scenarios, respectively. In case of deep learning, it achieved as high as 99% for best and 82% for the worst case scenario.

AB In this paper, a novel robust adaptive trajectory tracking control scheme with prescribed performance is developed for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) subject to unknown dynamic parameters and disturbances. A simple error mapping function is proposed in order to guarantee that the trajectory tracking error satisfies the prescribed performance. A novel additional control based on Nussbaum function is proposed to handle the underactuation of AUVs. The compounded uncertain item caused by the unknown dynamic parameters and disturbances is transformed into a linear parametric form with only single unknown parameter called virtual parameter. On the basis of the above, a novel robust adaptive trajectory tracking control law is developed using dynamic surface control technique, where the adaptive law online provides the estimation of the virtual parameter. Strict stability analysis indicates that the designed control law ensures uniform ultimate boundedness of the AUV trajectory tracking closed-loop control system with prescribed tracking performance. Simulation results on an AUV in two different disturbance cases with dynamic parameter perturbation verify the effectiveness of our adaptive trajectory tracking control scheme.

AB In the underwater world, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is created to assist in underwater research. This project presents a design analysis and modelling of AUV using computer aided design (CAD) simulation software, SolidWorks. The scope of this project divided into two parts: (a) AUV design and (b) analysis of battery enclosure stress and strain simulation and flow simulation of 3-blade propeller T100 thrusters. The AUV was designed part by part first and then the assembly of all the parts is carried out. In the simulation stress and fluids were applied on the enclosure box and a thruster, respectively, to observe the reaction of the parts as the frame and pressure hull from Blue ROV design. The result of the stress simulation shows that the enclosure box is very durable and can withstand up to 718.10 Pascal equivalents to 73.2 meter underwater depth. Furthermore, the outcome of flow simulation by using SolidWorks has shown that the maximum velocity of thruster flow is 4.939 m/s, while the acceleration of 5.655 m/s(2) of the AUV is calculated by using thrust force and mass of the AUV.

AB A predictive guidance obstacle avoidance algorithm (PGOA) in unknown environments is proposed for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that must adapt to multiple complex obstacle environments. Using the environmental information collected by the Forward-looking Sonar (FLS), the obstacle boundary is simplified by the convex algorithm and Bessel interpolation. Combining the predictive control secondary optimization function and the obstacle avoidance weight function, the predicting obstacle avoidance trajectory parameters are obtained. According to different types of obstacle environments, the corresponding obstacle avoidance rules are formulated. Lastly, combining with the obstacle avoidance parameters and rules, the AUV's predicting obstacle avoidance trajectory point is obtained. Then AUV can successfully achieve obstacle avoidance using the guidance algorithm. The simulation results show that the PGOA algorithm can better predict the trajectory point of the obstacle avoidance path of AUV, and the secondary optimization function can successfully achieve collision avoidance for different complex obstacle environments. Lastly, comparing the execution efficiency and cost of different algorithms, which deal with various complex obstacle environments, simulation experiment results indicate the high efficiency and great adaptability of the proposed algorithm.

The model on which the analysis is based considers the wireless communication range of the vehicles and the cluster length. In addition, the proposed analysis finds that the same calculation in related work underestimates the maximum inter-drone distance, stochastically limiting the vehicle-to-drone packet delay using the drone active service (DAS). Simulations are used to validate the proposed analysis.

AB Trajectory planning is a crucial aspect of autonomous driving for energy conservation ans savings, especially in electric vehicles (EVs). A particular vehicle inverse dynamics model is nec-essary to calculate the required torque and steering control for following the target trajectory. Consequently, the energy consumption of an EV can be minimized through optimal trajectory planning. This study proposes a method of optimizing an EV's trajectory to reduce energy consumption. First, the vehicle inverse dynamics model is developed using a semi-recursive method for modeling multibody dynamics. The suspension, steering, and braking system's dynamic properties are considered and modeled. Second, the servo constraints are formulated within given vehicle states and kinematic constraints to address the inverse dynamics of an EV. Third, a procedure for optimizing trajectories has been developed using an inverse dynamics model, servo constraints, and the Ritz method. The results indicate that the optimal trajectory uses the least amount of energy. The effects of the trajectory on energy consumption is also investigated. The necessary torques are applied to the left and right wheels, as well as the steering system's control input. A precise inverse dynamics model and servo constraints are used in self-driving EVs' proposed trajectory optimization method.

AB To highlight the advantages of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in modern traffic, it is necessary to investigate the sensing requirement parameters of the road environment during the vehicle braking process. Based on the texture information obtained using a field measurement, the braking model of an AV was built in Simulink and the ride comfort under typical braking scenarios was analyzed using CarSim/Simulink co-simulation. The results showed that the proposed brake system for the AV displayed a better performance than the traditional ABS when considering pavement adhesion characteristics. The braking pressure should be controlled to within the range of 4 MPa similar to 6 MPa on a dry road, while in wet road conditions, the pressure should be within 3 MPa similar to 4 MPa. When steering braking in dry road conditions, the duration of the "curve balance state" increased by about 57.14% compared with wet road conditions and the recommended curve radius was about 100 m. The slope gradient had a significant effect on the initial braking speed and comfort level. Overall, the ride comfort evaluation method was proposed to provide theoretical guidance for AV braking strategies, which can help to complement existing practices for road condition assessment.

AB Space and underwater vehicles with robotic arms can severely tax the capability of conventional control systems. Submersible vehicles used in neutral buoyancy simulation are subject to even greater demands since they must simulate the dynamics of spacecraft on orbit as well as function as a remotely-operated underwater vehicle. In this report, the onboard control architecture, human-machine interface, and vehicle/operator communications are described for one such vehicle in operation at the University of Maryland Neutral Buoyancy Research Facility (NBRF). The Ranger Neutral Buoyancy Vehicle (RNBV) exemplifies the high-dimensional, computationally intensive nature of the current fleet of autonomous underwater vehicles while its complement of four manipulators exceeds the capabilities of most remotely operated vehicles in service today. The sensor-based, embedded onboard control system is described, and its implementation using multiple control stations is discussed.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES
AB The use of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) cooperating in a network for anti-submarine warfare surveillance operations is of topical interest. Each AUV has to localise and track targets (submarines) robustly and precisely. This can be realised by a bistatic sonar configuration. The precise knowledge of the bistatic system parameters is mandatory for target tracking. These are in particular the positions of the acoustic sources, transmission times, and the position and heading of the AUV sonar sensor. However, these parameters often are not precisely known, e.g. for non-cooperative acoustic sources or due to navigation uncertainties of the AUV. Therefore, the authors consider the inverse problem, i.e. they estimate the bistatic system parameters by exploiting sonar echoes from known stationary targets' like wrecks or small islands. Their implementation of the estimation method is based on the multihypothesis tracking technique. Results are discussed for two applications: The first one is estimation of the parameters of a non-cooperative source. The second application focuses on the estimation of the receiver parameters; in particular they show that their approach can be used to increase robustness of AUV navigation. Their algorithms are tested with simulated and real data recorded by the Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation.

DE multimodal data source; integrity assessment; intelligent vehicles;

AB Autonomous driving systems tightly rely on the quality of the data from sensors for tasks such as localization and navigation. In this work, we present an integrity monitoring framework that can assess the quality of multimodal data from exteroceptive sensors. The proposed multisource coherence-based integrity assessment framework is capable of handling highway as well as complex semi-urban and urban scenarios. To achieve such generalization and scalability, we employ a semantic-grid data representation, which can efficiently represent the surroundings of the vehicle. The proposed method is used to evaluate the integrity of sources in several scenarios, and the integrity markers generated are used for identifying and quantifying unreliable data. A particular focus is given to real-world complex scenarios obtained from publicly available datasets where integrity localization requirements are of high importance. Those scenarios are examined to evaluate the performance of the framework and to provide proof-of-concept. We also establish the importance of the proposed integrity assessment framework in context-based localization applications for autonomous vehicles. The proposed method applies the integrity assessment concepts in the field of aviation to ground vehicles and provides the Protection Level markers (Horizontal, Lateral, Longitudinal) for perception systems used for vehicle localization.

TI Taxonomy of Shared Autonomous Vehicle Fleet Management Problems to

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID DELIVERY PROBLEM; ROUTING-PROBLEMS; PICKUP
AB This paper presents a taxonomy for classifying vehicle fleet management problems, across several dimensions, to inform future research on autonomous vehicle ( AV) fleets. Modeling the AV fleet management problem will bring about new classes of vehicle routing, scheduling, and fleet management problems; nevertheless, the existing literature related to vehicle routing, scheduling, and fleet management is a valuable foundation for future research on the AV fleet management problem. This paper classifies the broadly defined AV fleet management problem by using existing taxonomic categories in the literature; adds additional, or more nuanced, dimensions to existing taxonomic categories; and presents new taxonomic categories to classify specific AV fleet management problems. The broadly defined AV fleet management problem can be classified as a dynamic multivehicle pickup and delivery problem with explicit or implicit time window constraints. Existing studies that fit into this class of fleet management problems are reviewed. New taxonomy categories presented in this paper include fleet size elasticity, reservation structure, accept-reject decision maker, reservation time frame, ridesharing, vehicle repositioning, underlying network structure, and network congestion. Two goals of the taxonomy presented in this study are to provide researchers with a valuable reference as they begin to model AV fleet management problems and to present novel AV fleet management problems to spur interest from researchers.

AB This paper proposes a novel trajectory tracking control strategy for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs), subject to actuator constraints and under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Firstly, a fixed-time disturbance observer (FTDO) is used to estimate and compensate unknown external disturbances, which enhances the robustness of the motion system. Secondly, a novel fixed-time filter is designed by combining dynamic surface technology with fixed-time control, which avoids the problem of differential explosion, and reduces the filtering error. Lastly, in order to address the effects of actuator constraints and DoS attacks, an auxiliary system (AS) and a compensation system (CS) are included in the fixed-time dynamic surface controller based on FTDO. The proposed method improves the robustness, stability and accuracy of the closed-loop system. Additionally, the reference tracking error converges to the neighborhood of the origin within a fixed-time. The superiority of the proposed control method over traditional control strategies from the existing literature is demonstrated in simulations.

AB In this paper, the formation obstacle avoidance problem of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) under the disturbances of ocean currents is studied. A variable formation reconfiguration and obstacle avoidance control scheme based on affine transform and the improved artificial potential field (AT-IAPF) is designed, which enable AUVs to avoid both static and dynamic obstacles under external interference, and maintain the desired time-varying formation. Because of the robustness and strong effectiveness of the time-varying control of AT and the obstacle avoidance control law of IAPF. The AT-IAPF algorithm improves the multi-AUV systems' environmental adaptability and obstacle avoidance performance. Using the Lyapunov function's stability constraint guarantees stability of a multi-AUV system. A series of simulation results based on MATLAB verify that AUVs can effectively avoid obstacles with different formation shapes. Obstacle avoidance experiments on bionic robotic fish demonstrate the proposed method's feasibility.

AB Although reinforcement learning (RL) approaches are promising in autonomous traffic signal control (TSC), they often suffer from the unfairness problem that causes extremely long waiting time at intersections for partial vehicles. This is mainly because the traditional RL methods focus on optimizing the overall traffic performance, while the fairness of individual vehicles is neglected. To address this problem, we propose a novel RL-based method named FairLight for the fair and efficient control of traffic with variable phase duration. Inspired by the concept of user satisfaction index (USI) proposed in the transportation field, we introduce a fairness index in the design of key RL elements, which specially considers the travel quality (e.g., fairness). Based on our proposed hierarchical action space method, FairLight can accurately allocate the duration of traffic lights for selected phases. Experimental results obtained from various well-known traffic benchmarks show that, compared with the state-of-the-art RL-based TSC methods, FairLight can not only achieve better fairness performance but also improve the control quality from the perspectives of the average travel time of vehicles and RL convergence speed.

AB This paper is concerned with the networked cooperative path following (CPF) problem for multiple autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) subject to simultaneous cyber and physical attacks. First, to compensate the adverse effects of the physical-attack-induced bias injections, an extended state observer is designed to provide real-time estimates of the unmeasured velocities and unknown nonlinear terms. Next, to identify and handle various cyber attacks, a novel secure data transmission mechanism, featuring a secure transmitter and a secure receiver, is developed for each ASV. Then, a secure CPF control scheme, consisting of a networked cooperative kinematic control law and a networked kinetic control law, is presented. Furthermore, the observer error dynamics and networked CPF error dynamics are derived to account for the simultaneous network-induced delays, packet dropouts, physical attacks, and cyber attacks. The proposed control scheme is capable to preserve satisfactory secure tracking performance of the resulting CPF control system under a desired reference path even in the presence of external environmental disturbances, delays, packet dropouts, and malicious attacks. Finally, several case studies are provided to substantiate the effectiveness of the secure CPF control scheme.

AB To adapt to complex navigation conditions, this paper addresses the coordination formation of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) with the constraint of information interruption. For this purpose, a distributed robust fast finite-time formation control algorithm is proposed by fusion of the directed graph and neural network method. In the strategy, the graph theory is utilized for the channel of information transmission to maintain the stability of the formation system. In addition, the radial basic function (RBF) neural network is employed to approximate the structure uncertainty. Due to the merits of the robust neural damping technique, only two adaptive parameters are designed to compensate the perturbation from the model uncertainty and external environmental. Furthermore, an improved dynamic surface control (DSC) technology is developed for constituting the exponential term of the Lyapunov function. It is proven that the proposed scheme is able to achieve consensus tracking in finite time quickly, and the errors rapidly approach a small region around the origin. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm are verified by two numerical simulations.

AB Fisheries are essential for the economic supply of proteins. Detecting damaged fishnets using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) may be an efficient and safe solution for avoiding dangers to human divers. However, in turbid underwater environments, visibility is significantly degraded by floating particles that cause light attenuation, which is one of the main problems for accurate underwater inspection by optical cameras. To obtain clear images for net inspection, we propose an AUV pose control strategy for fish farming net inspection in turbid water, based on the mean gradient feature over the partial or entire image. To alleviate the laborious human process of setting the desired set-point for distance control, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained offline using a supervised learning method and combined with a controller. The proposed method can maintain a relatively constant relative pose with respect to a fishnet, which is sufficient to acquire clear net images in turbid water and check whether a part of the net is damaged or not. Experimental results in both swimming pools and real fish farm environments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

AB The articulated intervention autonomous underwater vehicle (AIAUV) is an underwater swimming manipulator with intervention capabilities. Station-keeping and trajectory tracking are essential for the AIAUV to be able to move in confined spaces and to perform intervention tasks. In this article, we propose using a generalized super-twisting algorithm (GSTA), which is an extension of the regular super-twisting algorithm, for the trajectory tracking of the position and orientation of the base of the AIAUV in six degrees of freedom (6DOF). We also propose using a higher-order sliding mode observer (HOSMO) for estimating the linear and angular velocities when velocity measurements are unavailable. Furthermore, we show the ultimate boundedness of the tracking errors for a control law using the GSTA and for a control law that combines the GSTA with an HOSMO. We also prove that the GSTA gives global uniform finite-time stability. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the proposed control laws with comprehensive simulation and experimental results.

AB A new method in which the consensus algorithm is used to solve the coordinate control problems of leaderless multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (multi-AUVs) with double independent Markovian switching communication topologies and time-varying delays among the underwater sensors is investigated. This is accomplished by first dividing the communication topology into two different switching parts, i.e., velocity and position, to reduce the data capacity per data package sent between the multi-AUVs in the ocean. Then, the state feedback linearization is used to simplify and rewrite the complex nonlinear and coupled mathematical model of the AUVs into a double-integrator dynamic model. Consequently, coordinate control of the multi-AUVs is regarded as an approximating consensus problem with various time-varying delays and velocity and position topologies. Considering these factors, sufficient conditions of consensus control are proposed and analyzed and the stability of the multi-AUVs is proven by Lyapunov-Krasovskii theorem. Finally, simulation results that validate the theoretical results are presented.

AB A novel robust adaptive neural network (NN) control scheme with prescribed performance is developed for the 3-D trajectory tracking of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with uncertain dynamics and unknown disturbances using new prescribed performance functions, an additional term, the radial basis function (RBF) NN, and the command-filtered backstepping approach. Different from the traditional prescribed performance functions, the new prescribed performance functions are innovatively proposed such that the time desired for the trajectory tracking errors of AUVs to reach and stay within the prescribed error tolerance band can be preset exactly and flexibly. The additional term with the Nussbaum function is designed to deal with the underactuation problem of AUVs. By means of RBF NN, the uncertain item lumped by the uncertain dynamics of AUVs and unknown disturbances is eventually transformed into a linearly parametric form with only a single unknown parameter. The developed control scheme ensures that all signals in the AUV 3-D trajectory tracking closed-loop control system are bounded. Simulation results with comparisons show the validity and the superiority of our developed control scheme.

AB Paradigm-shifting technologies such as Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) despite a wealth of promised benefits for the future of our cities may generate new unprecedented threats. The transportation industry will be the first to experience the aftermath of AVs since these can kill driving professions and create new layers of employabilityrelated social exclusion. This paper appraises public perceptions of AVs and their employment repercussions as a forecasting tool that can drive equitable policy planning that prioritises humans over machines. The study is based on an online survey of 773 responses from an international audience. Descriptive statistics and ordinal regression modelling have been used. Most respondents recognised that the arrival of AVs is likely to revolutionise the distribution of jobs within the transport industry. They also believe governments are not prepared for the transformations AVs will force upon workplace arenas. Age, field of work/study, level of understanding AVs, income, gender, awareness about the risks on own employment were factors influencing the respondents' perceptions of whether transport professionals' job security will be jeopardised. The study argues that AVs are perceived as a significant employment disruptor and that reskilling, public engagement and awareness exercises should be widely adopted by the stakeholders 'responsible' for the transition.

AB Autonomous navigation and collision avoidance missions represent a significant challenge for robotics systems as they generally operate in dynamic environments that require a high level of autonomy and flexible decision-making capabilities. This challenge becomes more applicable in micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) due to their limited size and computational power. This paper presents a novel approach for enabling a micro aerial vehicle system equipped with a laser range finder to autonomously navigate among obstacles and achieve a user-specified goal location in a GPS-denied environment, without the need for mapping or path planning. The proposed system uses an actor-critic-based reinforcement learning technique to train the aerial robot in a Gazebo simulator to perform a point-goal navigation task by directly mapping the noisy MAV's state and laser scan measurements to continuous motion control. The obtained policy can perform collision-free flight in the real world while being trained entirely on a 3D simulator. Intensive simulations and real-time experiments were conducted and compared with a nonlinear model predictive control technique to show the generalization capabilities to new unseen environments, and robustness against localization noise. The obtained results demonstrate our system's effectiveness in flying safely and reaching the desired points by planning smooth forward linear velocity and heading rates.

AB In order to improve the agility and applicability of trajectory planning algorithm for autonomous vehicles, this paper proposes a novel actor-critic based learning method for decision-making and planning in multi-vehicle complex traffic. It is the coupling planning of vehicle's path and speed thus to make the trajectory more flexible. First, generations from the decided action to the planned trajectory are described by the end-point of the trajectory. Then, the actor-critic based learning method is built to learn an optimal policy for the decision process. It can update the policy by the gradient of the current policy's advantage. In this process, features of the real traffic are carefully extracted by time headway (TH) and speed distribution. Reward function is built by the safety, efficiency and driving comfort. Furthermore, to make the policy network have better convergency, the policy network is modularized in two parts: the lane-changing network and the lane-keeping network, which decide the optimal end-point of the path and speed candidates respectively. Finally, the curved overtaking scenario and the interaction process with human driver are conducted to illustrate the feasibility and superiority. The results show that the proposed method has better real-time performance and can make the planned coupling trajectory more continuous and smoother than the existing rule-based method.

AB In this paper, optimal three-dimensional paths are generated offline for waypoint guidance of a miniature Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). Having the starting point, the destination point, and the position and dimension of the obstacles, the AUV is intended to systematically plan an optimal path toward the target. The path is defined as a set of waypoints to be passed by the vehicle. Four criteria are considered for evaluation of an optimal path; they are "total length of path", "margin of safety", "smoothness of the planar motion" and "gradient of diving". A set of Pareto-optimal solutions is found where each solution represents an optimal feasible path that cannot be outrun by any other path considering all four criteria. Then, a proposed three-dimensional guidance system is used for guidance of the AUV through selected optimal paths. This system is inspired from the Line-of-Sight (LOS) guidance strategy; the idea is to select the desired depth, presumed proportional to the horizontal distance of the AUV and the target. To develop this guidance strategy, the dynamic modeling of this novel miniature AUV is also derived. The simulation results show that this guidance system efficiently guides the AUV through the optimal paths. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Iceberg-relative navigation for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) will enable a new mode of data collection for studies of free-floating icebergs. Compared to current data collection methods, autonomous underwater vehicles offer substantially expanded coverage area and continuous sampling. However, because icebergs translate and rotate through inertial space, standard vehicle navigation methods which rely on inertial sensors are unable to provide iceberg-relative position estimates.
   Presented here is a new iceberg-relative vehicle navigation technique which is an extension of existing work in terrain-relative navigation. The technique comprises a mapping step and localization step, each of which is modified here to account for the translation and the rotation of free-floating icebergs.
   In the mapping step, the AUV circumnavigates the iceberg at a sequence of constant depths, collecting multibeam sonar imagery of the iceberg's submerged surface. A map is then generated in post-processing by projecting these sonar data from their corresponding vehicle positions (accounting for iceberg motion) in a frame that is fixed to the iceberg. Overlapping sonar data from the beginning and end of a circumnavigation provide the information necessary to enforce self-consistency of the iceberg map.
   In the localization step, the AUV uses the previously generated map to determine its position and orientation with respect to the iceberg by correlating incoming sonar ranges with the map. The estimator works by maintaining explicit estimates not only of the vehicle position and orientation, but also of the iceberg translation and rotation rates through inertial space.
   Results from a proof-of-concept field demonstration of this new iceberg-relative AUV navigation technique prove the feasibility of both generating a self-consistent three-dimensional map of a moving iceberg and localizing a vehicle's position with respect to that iceberg. The data for the experiment were collected using a sideways looking multibeam sonar mounted on the side of the RVIB Nathaniel B Palmer during a circumnavigation of a small iceberg in the Scotia Sea.

AB The continuous evolution of automotive and communication technologies can result in more efficient traffic management. At roundabouts, Autonomous and Connected Vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to enhance traffic operations, minimizing lost time and providing higher capacities by improving the gap acceptance process.
   This research aims to take advantage of those evolving technologies in order to design a more efficient traffic management system for single-lane roundabouts. Such a system would provide optimal coordination of CAVs to negotiate the roundabout, maximizing throughput and minimizing average control delay. The expert system developed and tested (Roundabout Manager) acts as a central controller and manages conflicts within the roundabout. It prioritizes incoming vehicles based on demanddependent strategies and adjusts their trajectories accounting for the geometry of the roundabout. Seven strategies are proposed to coordinate CAV trajectories. The first strategy prioritizes incoming vehicles based on their Shortest-Remaining-Time-First (SRTF, i.e., the shortest time till the vehicle reaches the first conflict section it will encounter) to the conflict sections within the circular roadway, while the other strategies add to the SRTF rules to accommodate highly unbalanced traffic flows, with heavy right- or left-turning maneuvers.
   To illustrate the operation of the algorithm and assess its effectiveness as a function of the demand distribution, a total of 15 oversaturated demand scenarios with 10 replications per scenario were simulated for each of the seven strategies examined. It was concluded that, under any of the strategies proposed, the system guarantees higher throughput with lower average control delay compared to conventional vehicles? operation. The capacity of the roundabout under fully CAVs traffic flow is increased by 58 to 73% (from low to high conflicting flow, respectively). The strategy that prioritizes vehicles that have to travel through more conflict points and those that leave the system first outperforms the other strategies at all demand scenarios, becoming the optimal coordination of CAVs at roundabouts. This strategy reduces the average control delay between 80 and 97% compared to traffic with conventional vehicles, as assessed using the Highway Capacity Manual procedures.

AB The performance of biomimetic underwater vehicles directly depends on the correct design of their propulsion system and its control. These vehicles can attain highly efficient motion, hovering and thrust by properly moving part(s) of their bodies. In this article, a mathematical modeling and waypoint guidance system for a biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicle (BAUV) is proposed. The BAUV achieves sideways and dorsoventral thunniform motion by flapping its caudal fin through a parallel mechanism. Also, an analysis of the vehicle's design is presented. A thrust analysis was performed based on the novel propulsion system. Furthermore, the vehicle's kinematics and dynamic models were derived, where hydrodynamic equations were obtained as well. Computed models were validated using simulations where thrust and moment analysis was employed to visualize the vehicle's performance while swimming. For the path tracking scheme, a waypoint guidance system was designed to correct the vehicle's direction toward several positions in space. To accurately obtain waypoints, correction over the propeller's flapping frequency and bias was employed to achieve proper thrust and orientation of the vehicle. The results from numerical simulations showed how by incorporating this novel propulsion strategy, the BAUV improved its performance when diving and maneuvering based on the dorsoventral and/or sideways configuration of its swimming mode. Furthermore, by designing proper strategies to regulate the flapping performance of its caudal fin, the BAUV followed the desired trajectories. The efficiency for the designed strategy was obtained by comparing the vehicle's traveled distance and ideal scenarios of straight-line trajectories between targets. During simulations, the designed guidance system presented an efficiency of above 80% for navigation tasks.

AB This paper proposes a novel disturbance estimator-based nonsingular fast fuzzy terminal sliding-mode formation control method. The leader-follower formation control method is combined with the path planning strategy based on the artificial potential field to be collision-free and move in consensus for each AUV. An improved sliding-mode surface is incorporated into the controller, providing the system's state with a faster convergence rate away from the stable equilibrium. The chattering problem in the controller is eliminated by designing fuzzy control rules which are derived from the Lyapunov energy function. A disturbance estimator is proposed to compensate for unknown dynamic and disturbances, which enhances the robustness and stability of the system. Simulation and comparison results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Operations with Intervention Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (I-AUV) can not only realize automatic and accurate missions, but also save the pilots' endeavors and reduce their fatigues. However, the performance of a small sized I-AUV is easily affected by its own restoring forces and hydrodynamic effects. A novel small sized single body and streamlined I-AUV has been developed for autonomous cruising and manipulation through the schemes comparisons and analysis on the restoring forces and hydrodynamic performance. In order to investigate I-AUV manipulation hydrodynamic performance during manipulation, water channel experiments and computation fluid dynamics (CFD) have been made on various operation postures. Moreover, CFD simulations and analysis have been expanded from water channel domain to infinite domain to obtain I-AUV manipulation hydrodynamic performance during forward cruising.

AB A vision-aided inertial navigation system that enables autonomous flight of an aerial vehicle in Global Positioning System (GPS)-denied environments is presented. Particularly, feature point information from a monocular vision sensor are used to bound the drift resulting from integrating accelerations and angular rate measurements from an inertial measurement unit forward in time. An extended Kalman filter framework is proposed for performing the tasks of vision-based mapping and navigation separately. When GPS is available, multiple observations of a single landmark point from the vision sensor are used to estimate the point's location in inertial space. When GPS is not available, points that have been sufficiently mapped out can be used for estimating vehicle position and attitude. Simulation and flight test results of a vehicle operating autonomously in a simplified loss-of-GPS scenario verify the presented method.

AB This paper proposes a new haptic shared control concept between the human driver and the automation for lane keeping in semi-autonomous vehicles. Based on the principle of human-machine interaction during lane keeping, the level of cooperativeness for completion of driving task is introduced. Using the proposed human-machine cooperative status along with the driver workload, the required level of haptic authority is determined according to the driver's performance characteristics. Then, a time-varying assistance factor is developed to modulate the assistance torque, which is designed from an integrated driver-in-the-loop vehicle model taking into account the yaw-slip dynamics, the steering dynamics, and the human driver dynamics. To deal with the time-varying nature of both the assistance factor and the vehicle speed involved in the driver-in-the-loop vehicle model, a new l(infinity) linear parameter varying control technique is proposed. The predefined specifications of the driver-vehicle system are guaranteed using Lyapunov stability theory. The proposed haptic shared control method is validated under various driving tests conducted with high-fidelity simulations. Extensive performance evaluations are performed to highlight the effectiveness of the new method in terms of driver-automation conflict management.

AB This paper presents a two-layer controller for accurate and robust lateral path tracking control of highly automated vehicles. The upper-layer controller, which produces the front wheel steering angle, is implemented with a Linear Time-Varying MPC (LTV-MPC) whose prediction and control horizon are both optimized offline with particle swarm optimization (PSO) under varying working conditions. A constraint on the slip angle is imposed to prevent lateral forces from saturation to guarantee vehicle stability. The lower layer is a radial basis function neural network proportion-integral-derivative (RBFNN-PID) controller that generates electric current control signals executable by the steering motor to rapidly track the target steering angle. The nonlinear characteristics of the steering system are modeled and are identified on-line with the RBFNN so that the PID controller's control parameters can be adjusted adaptively. The results of CarSim-Matlab/Simulink joint simulations show that the proposed hierarchical controller achieves a good level of path tracking accuracy while maintaining vehicle stability throughout the path tracking process, and is robust to dynamic changes in vehicle velocities and road adhesion coefficients.

AB Advanced Driving Assist Systems (ADAS) are on the rise in new cars, including versions that embed artificial intelligence in computer vision systems that leverage deep learning algorithms. Because these systems, at the present time, cannot operate in all operational driving domains, they employ some type of driver monitoring system for assessing driver attention, so that drivers can effectively take control if and when an ADAS system can no longer control the car. To determine the reliability of a driver alerting system when linked to autonomy that leverages deep learning, a set of increasingly complex tests were conducted on three Tesla Model 3 vehicles. Tests were conducted on a highway and a closed test track to test road departure and construction zone detection capabilities. Results revealed significant between- and within-vehicle variation on a number of metrics related to driver monitoring, alerting, and safe operation of the underlying autonomy. In some cases, cars performed better than expected but all cars exhibited both inconsistent and unsafe behaviors as well as poor driver alerting. These results highlight that a post-deployment regulatory process is ill-equipped to flag significant issues in vehicles with embedded artificial intelligence.

The proposed method transforms the initial path given by local path planning algorithms using a stochastic approach to improve its smoothness and safety. Using the proposed method, the initial path is efficiently transformed by iteratively updating the position of each waypoint within it. The proposed method also guarantees the feasibility of the transformed path. Experimental results verify that the proposed method can improve the smoothness and safety of the initial path and ensure the feasibility of the transformed path.

AB Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) represent a rapidly growing technological field with features believed to potentially support the development of more sustainable mobility systems in city regions. To succeed as a sustainable mode of mobility, however, many current car owners must replace their private vehicles with SAVs. Based on a survey of citizens in Oslo and 12 other Norwegian cities, as well as in-depth interviews with citizens living in a location where SAV is tested, this study explores the relationships between people's everyday mobility patterns and their future interest in using SAVs. The study located six different mobility practices and found a positive interest in the use of SAVs among people who adhere to a shared mobility type of practice, while the resistance was strongest among people who adhere to different car-based mobility practices. Also, those whose current mobility practice involves the use of electric cars had little interest in replacing their cars with SAVs. The study points to some paradoxes and challenges that are critical to handle if an upscaling of SAVs is to be part of a future sustainable mobility mode.

AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) is expected to reshape the future transportation system, and its decision-making is one of the most critical modules. Many current decision-making modules are designed scenario-by-scenario and thus are not capable of meeting high-level AV requirements for lack of scalability to cope with the diversity of drivers' demands and the infinity of traffic elements. This paper surveys the decision-making design inspired by driver intelligence and environment reasoning with better scalability for future high-level AVs. It involves three aspects: human factors in driving, environment reasoning, and detailed decision methods. The current state of the art of these three sections is surveyed in this paper. The characteristics of distinguished drivers, their decision mechanism, and the factors influencing decision-making are reviewed first to learn from excellent drivers. Environment reasoning is introduced following as a three-layer structure consisting of restriction, interaction, and attention. The optimization-based decision-making algorithms are then reviewed from the aspect of optimization targets, frameworks, applied scenarios, and limitations. Inspired by the existing research on driver intelligence and environment reasoning, a promising decision-making framework is also introduced for high-level AV design.

AB Underwater pipeline inspection is an important topic in off-shore subsea operations. Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) can play an important role in multiple application areas including military, ocean science, aquaculture, shipping, and energy. However, using ROVs for inspection is not cost-effective, and the fixed leak detection sensors mounted along the pipeline have limited precision. Although the cost can be significantly reduced by applying autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), the unstable current, low visibility, and loss of GPS signal make the navigation of AUVs underwater very challenging. Previous studies have been conducted on coordinate-based, vision-based, and fusion-based navigation algorithms. However, the coordinate-based algorithms suffered from the denial of GPS signals while the vision-based methods typically relied on terrain and landscape knowledge that required collection prior to the mission. As a result of these issues, a navigation system for an AUV that incorporates vision and sonar sensors is presented in this article. In a robot operating system (ROS)/Gazebo-based simulation environment, the AUV had the ability to find and navigate toward the pipeline and continuously traverse along its length. Additionally, with a chemical concentration sensor mounted on the AUV, the system demonstrated the capability of inspecting the pipeline and reporting the leak point with a resolution of 3 m along the pipeline.

AB Autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems use vehicles that move horizontally along rails within the storage racks, while vertical movements are provided by lifts. The solution proposed in this paper addresses a particular system configuration that works with multiple deep storage lanes that are widely used in the food and beverage industry, characterised by large volumes of products of limited variety. The generic deep lane is single item, i.e. one stock keeping unit, and single batch, i.e. one production lot, thereby affecting the performance of the system in terms of storage capacity utilisation and throughput. Determining the number and depth of the lanes is crucial to aid the design and control of such a storage system. The aim of this paper was to support the design of AVS/RSs though a set of original analytic models for the determination of the travelled distance and time for single-command and dual-command cycles given alternative layout configurations. The models are validated by simulation and exemplified with a real-warehousing case study. The paper presents useful guidelines for the configuration of the system layout including the determination of the optimal shape ratio and the length of the lanes.

AB This study aims to give the possible adoption of autonomous vehicles (AV)in Indian smart cities. The majority of accidents that occur in Indian cities are from metropolitan areas, and the primary cause is human error. The adaptation of AVs for transportation would undoubtedly reduce these numbers while also assisting in the transformation and further development of Indian smart cities. For the analysis, the demographic and economic profile of smart city Noida has been selected which is quite fit for the analysis. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) is chosen as the most practical framework for measuring AV adoption by residents. The study also examines the AVs technology adaptation and UTAUT method in support of many aspects that should be considered for greater acceptance of AVs technology in Noida. According to the findings of the investigation, AV technology has a significant potential to aid in the development of Indian smart cities by lowering travel costs while also providing passengers with safety and comfort. The main finding of this research indicates that residents of the smart city are willing to adopt AV technology, with an overall adoption willingness reaching 83%. Notably, among the age group of 18 to 25, an impressive 89% display a strong willingness for the adoption of AV technology.

AB This paper proposes a novel motion planning and tracking framework based on improved artificial potential fields (APFs) and a lane change strategy to enhance the performance of the active collision avoidance systems of autonomous vehicles on structured roads. First, an improved APF-based hazard evaluation module, which is inspired by discrete optimization, is established to describe driving hazards in the Frenet-Serret coordinate. Next, a strategy for changing lane is developed in accordance with the characteristics of the gradient descent method (GDM). On the basis of the potential energy distribution of the target obstacle and road boundaries, GDM is utilized to generate the path for changing lane. In consideration of the safety threats of traffic participants, the effects of other obstacles on safety are taken as additional safety constraints when the lane-changing speed profile for ego vehicles is designed. Then, after being mapped into the Cartesian coordinate, the feasible trajectory is sent to the tracking layer, where a proportional-integral control and model predictive control (PI-MPC) based coordinated controller is applied. Lastly, several cases composed of different road geometrics and obstacles are tested to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Results illustrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve active collision avoidance in complex traffic scenarios.

AB Computer vision and deep neural networks have been significantly promoting the development of visual perception in these years. Particularly, for autonomous vehicles, real-time image/video data is captured by onboard cameras and analyzed by computer vision techniques in many real applications. In the captured camera data, some contents can be used as auxiliary information to infer individuals' locations and trajectories, which leads to severe privacy leakage but has been rarely studied. Thus, the goal of this article is to protect individuals' location privacy by hiding side-channel information in the captured data while preserving the data utility for downstream applications. To this end, the technology of generative adversarial networks (GAN) is utilized to design two novel models, named ADGAN-I and ADGAN-II, both of which can take the original camera data as inputs and generate privacy-preserving outputs according to predefined sensitive object class. Thus, the processed camera data can defend location inference attack from adversaries in offline applications. Moreover, in ADGAN-I and ADGAN-II, the tradeoff between location privacy and data utility can be effectively balanced. Finally, the results of extensive real-data experiments validate the superiority of our proposed models over the state of the arts in utility preservation and privacy protection for autonomous vehicles' images and videos.

AB Technology providers, car manufacturers, and public agencies all need to work together to undertake extensive testing of fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) on public roads before such AVs are allowed to freely travel in ways similar to human-driven vehicles. This raises the importance of understanding public perceptions regarding safety considerations when traveling alongside AVs. This study makes use of a national survey conducted by the Pew Research Center to identify the affective, socio-demographic and technology-use attributes that affect an individual's perception of the safety of sharing the road with AVs (PSSRAV) and identifies measures and interventions that can be undertaken to improve PSSRAV. Additionally, we evaluate individual preferences for AV regulations. Our results underscore the importance of the need for service providers and public agencies to be cognizant of the demographic and lifestyle/affective emotion considerations shaping AV safety perceptions and opinions about AV regulations. In particular, there is a need not only to focus on technological and other infrastructure components of AV development, but also to recognize the socio-technical considerations and human-related factors of the end-users. Our findings should be of substantial interest in the planning, design, deployment, and introduction of AVs within a safe and minimally regulated public operating arena.

AB The overall goal of the paper is to derive a kinematic model for vehicle path-following systems, where the pitch and yaw angles $(\theta, \psi)$ together with the surge velocity $u$ can be treated as control inputs. Then the outer control loop can be designed as a nonlinear path-following guidance law. At the same time, the inner control loops can be stabilized using commercial autopilot systems to control the pitch and yaw angles. The main result of the paper is a novel kinematic amplitude-phase representation of the North-East-Down (NED) positional rates, which can replace the classical Euler angle rotation matrix representation. The proposed kinematic model gives equivalent NED positional rates as the rotation matrix representation for all combinations of the Euler angles and the linear velocities. The main advantage of the kinematic amplitude-phase representation is the design of vehicle guidance laws using nonlinear control theory and Lyapunov stability analysis. Furthermore, it is shown that nonlinear guidance laws can be designed for path following and that the proposed methods guarantee that the origins are uniformly semiglobally exponentially stable (USGES). A case study of an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) demonstrates how a path-following control system can be designed using the amplitude-phase representation.

AB Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) is a transformative technology that has great potential to improve urban traffic and driving safety. Electric Vehicle (EV) is becoming the key subject of next-generation CAVs by virtue of its advantages in energy saving. Due to the limited endurance and computing capacity of EVs, it is challenging to meet the surging demand for computing-intensive and delay-sensitive in-vehicle intelligent applications. Therefore, computation offloading has been employed to extend a single vehicle's computing capacity. Although various offloading strategies have been proposed to achieve good computing performace in the Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) environment, it remains challenging to jointly optimize the offloading failure rate and the total energy consumption of the offloading process. To address this challenge, in this paper, we establish a computation offloading model based on Markov Decision Process (MDP), taking into consideration task dependencies, vehicle mobility, and different computing resources for task offloading. We then design a computation offloading strategy based on deep reinforcement learning, and leverage the Deep Q-Network based on Simulated Annealing (SA-DQN) algorithm to optimize the joint objectives. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy effectively reduces the offloading failure rate and the total energy consumption for application offloading.

AB In the field of autonomous vehicles, various heterogeneous sensors, such as LiDAR, Radar, camera, etc, are combined to improve the vehicle ability of sensing accuracy and robustness. Multi-modal perception and learning has been proved to be an effective method to help vehicle understand the nature of complex environments. Event camera is a bio-inspired vision sensor that captures dynamic changes in the scene and filters out redundant information with high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. These characteristics of the event camera make it have a certain application potential in the field of autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we introduce a fully convolutional neural network with feature attention gate component (FAGC) for vehicle detection by combining frame-based and event-based vision. Both grayscale features and event features are fed into the feature attention gate component (FAGC) to generate the pixel-level attention feature coefficients to improve the feature discrimination ability of the network. Moreover, we explore the influence of different fusion strategies on the detection capability of the network. Experimental results demonstrate that our fusion method achieves the best detection accuracy and exceeds the accuracy of the method that only takes single-mode signal as input.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Autonomous electric vehicles; drift control; jump-start reinforcement
   learning (RL); severe brake failure
AB Brake system failure may occur because of design defects, poor maintenance, or improper operation and is one of the causes of serious traffic accidents. For high-speed vehicles, brake system failure can cause them to almost lose the ability to avoid collisions. Currently, there are no active safety functions for vehicles with near-total brake system failure. In this article, an adaptive drift-control method is proposed to reduce longitudinal speed and avoid collisions after brake system failure. Collision risk is analyzed by combining longitudinal obstacles and lateral traffic environments. The controller adaptively adopts a control policy according to the collision risk. Vehicle modeling is performed considering four-dimensional nonlinear and coupled dynamics in drift control. The control policy is based on a multilayer neural network that is trained using the jump-start soft actor critic algorithm. Initiated from an expert-guided policy, this algorithm iteratively updates the policy. Finally, we test and validate the proposed drift controller in real vehicle tests. The results demonstrate that the adaptive drift controller has the ability to rapidly stop the controlled vehicle and avoid collisions after near-total brake failure. In addition, the lateral displacement during drift is effectively suppressed in real tests, thus avoiding potential lateral collisions and achieving omnidirectional obstacle avoidance.

AB A control system for driving an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) performing docking operations in presence of tidal current disturbances is proposed. The nonlinear model of the vehicle has been modelled in a Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) form. This is suitable for the design of the control system using a model-based approach. The LPV model was used for a Model Predictive Control (MPC) design for computing the set of forces and moments driving the nonlinear vehicle model. The LPV-MPC control action is mapped into the reference signals for the actuators by using a Thrust Allocation (TA) algorithm. This was based on the nonlinear models for the actuators and their position and orientation on the vehicle's hull. The structural decomposition of MPC and TA reduces the computational burden involved in computing the control law on-line on an embedded control board. Both MPC and TA algorithms use the vehicle's linear and angular positions, and velocities that are estimated by an LPV based Kalman Filter (KF). The proposed control system has been tested in different docking scenarios using various tidal current disturbances acting on the vehicle as an unmeasured disturbance. The simulation results show the controller is effective in controlling the AUV over the range of control scenarios meeting the constraints and specifications.

   Vehicles: Traffic Evolution and Control using Spring-Mass-Damper System
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
ID ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; FLOW; RELAXATION
AB This paper sheds light on mixed-traffic dynamics considering the differences in driving characteristics, namely acceleration/ deceleration rate, desired speed, and response time, between connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). In light traffic, these differences were found to induce platoon formations, headed by vehicles with a lower acceleration rate and propensity not to exceed the desired speed (HDV in this study). Platoon formations lead to large inter-platoon spacing that can be utilized to accommodate cut-in vehicles. In a near-capacity condition, however, the differences in driving characteristics can induce voids and undermine traffic throughput when traffic is disturbed by merging vehicles. Based on these findings, a simple CAV control method is proposed based on the spring-mass-damper (SMD) system approach that directly considers the HDV behavior to mitigate disturbance propagation and throughput reduction. The main principle is to adjust the control parameters (lower spring coefficient and higher damping coefficient in the SMD control model) with an aim to control CAVs to absorb the cut-in impact (i.e., spacing shortage) before it reaches the first upstream HDV. A simulation experiment suggests the feasible region of the control parameters, subject to the recovery time, the number of control-lable CAVs, and the cut-in impact.

AB Current production navigation systems for agricultural vehicles rely on GPS as the primary sensor for steering control. In citrus groves, where the tree canopy frequently blocks the satellite signals to the GPS receiver, an alternative method is required. This paper discusses the development of an autonomous guidance system for use in a,citrus grove. The vehicle used for this study was a common tractor. Machine vision and laser radar (ladar) were individually used for guidance and a rotary encoder was used to provide feedback on the steering angle. A PID controller was developed to minimize the path error. The vehicle's guidance accuracy was tested in flexible test paths constructed of common hay bales. Path tracking performance was observed. The guidance system guided the tractor automatically through straight and curved paths. An average error of 2.8 cm using machine vision guidance and an average error of 2.5 cm using ladar guidance was observed, when the vehicle was tested in a curved path at a speed of 3.1 m/s. The guidance system successfully guided the vehicle in a citrus grove alleyway. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   OPTIMIZATION
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are increasingly used for undersea exploration. The endurance of AUVs is limited by the onboard energy storage among which the battery systems dominate. Various underwater recharging methods are employed to increase the AUV range and autonomy. Currently, contact-based underwater recharging utilizes the wet-mate connector technology that requires a high-precision AUV docking, and is prone to electrical safety issues. To overcome these limitations, underwater wireless recharging techniques for AUVs have been explored in recent years. Wireless charging offers a safe and reliable method for autonomous power transfer between a charging station and a vehicle. This article reviews the state-of-the-art inductive wireless power transfer (IWPT) solutions for underwater applications and discusses the engineering challenges of the IWPT system design. Underwater environmental factors, such as seawater conductivity, temperature, pressure, water currents, and biofouling phenomenon, impose constraints on IWPT systems. A comprehensive review of AUV energy storage systems, docking methods, IWPT system control methods, and compensation networks is presented in this article. Based on the main operational and constructional principles, the AUV IWPT systems are categorized as loosely coupled transformers and resonant IWPT systems. Each of the categories is illustrated through their main design principles and implementations reported in the literature so far. Technical challenges, such as integration of IWPT system into an AUV hull, interoperability, alignment and retention issues, docking station sinking and stability, the design of pressure-tolerant charging electronics, data transfer, and the battery operation in the underwater environment are discussed in this article too. The article is concluded with the best practice overview of designing an IWPT system for AUVs.

AB There is extensive theoretical literature that looks at factors that make people more or less likely to change their opinions as additional information is gathered. People whose opinions are less likely to change in response to information may have strong anchoring effects (commitments to initial opinions) or may support their initial opinion by selectively processing information to confirm their initial opinion (confirmation bias). Selectively processing information can also result in opinion polarization where opinions become more extreme as additional information is provided. While theoretical literature has been relatively abundant on this topic, there has been limited empirical evidence with transportation-related opinions as to how anchoring effects and confirmation bias may affect changing opinions and possible opinion polarization. The intent of the current paper is to provide some initial evidence of changing opinions and possible polarization as it relates to the potential adoption of autonomous vehicles, which will likely be a key element in future sustainable transportation strategies. Specifically, the paper studies how people's initial autonomous-vehicle adoption likelihoods change after being asked a common set of questions that leads them through an assessment of factors involved in adoption. A series of discrete outcome models were estimated to determine the factors that influence the likelihood of people changing their initial opinions. Although the empirical models identified many variables associated with opinion change, it is argued that traditional transportation surveys may not be gathering the type of data needed to truly understand how people's transportation-related decisions evolve in response to new information.

AB This paper presents a comparative study of different lateral controllers applied to the autonomous steering of automobiles. The nonlinear nature of vehicle dynamics makes it a challenging problem in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) field, as long as a stable, accurate controller is compulsorily needed in order to ensure safety during navigation. The problem has been tackled under two different approaches. The first one is based on chained systems theory, while the second controller relies on fuzzy logic. A comparative analysis has been carried out based on the results achieved in practical trials. Real tests were conducted using a DGPS-driven electric Citroen Berlingo in a private test circuit located at the Industrial Automation Institute of the CSIC (Arganda del Rey, Madrid). The final results and conclusions are presented.

AB In conventional modern vehicles, the Internet of Things-based automotive embedded systems are used to collect various data from real-time sensors and store it in the cloud platform to perform visualization and analytics. The proposed work is to implement computer vision-aided vehicle intercommunication V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) implemented using the Internet of Things for an autonomous vehicle. Computer vision-based driver assistance supports the vehicle to perform efficiently in critical transitions such as lane change or collision avoidance during the autonomous driving mode. In addition to this, the main work emphasizes observing multiple parameters of the In-Vehicle system such as speed, distance covered, idle time, and fuel economy by the electronic control unit are evaluated in this process. Electronic control unit through brake control module, powertrain control module, transmission control module, suspension control module, and battery management system helps to predict the nature of drive-in different terrains and also can suggest effective custom driving modes for advanced driver assistance systems. These features are implemented with the help of the vehicle-to-infrastructure protocol, which collects data through gateway nodes that can be visualized in the IoT data frame. The proposed work involves the process of analyzing and visualizing the driver-influencing factors of a modern vehicle that is in connection with the IoT cloud platform. The custom drive mode suggestion and improvisation had been completed with help of computational analytics that leads to the deployment of an over-the-air update to the vehicle embedded system upgradation for betterment in drivability. These operations are progressed through a cloud server which is the prime factor proposed in this work.

AB The advancements in connected and autonomous vehicles in these times demand the availability of tools providing the agents with the capability to be aware and predict their own states and context dynamics. This article presents a novel approach to develop an initial level of collective awareness (CA) in a network of intelligent agents. A specific collective self-awareness functionality is considered, namely, agent-centered detection of abnormal situations present in the environment around any agent in the network. Moreover, the agent should be capable of analyzing how such abnormalities can influence the future actions of each agent. Data-driven dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) models learned from time series of sensory data recorded during the realization of tasks (agent network experiences) are here used for abnormality detection and prediction. A set of DBNs, each related to an agent, is used to allow the agents in the network to reach synchronously aware possible abnormalities occurring when available models are used on a new instance of the task for which DBNs have been learned. A growing neural gas (GNG) algorithm is used to learn the node variables and conditional probabilities linking nodes in the DBN models; a Markov jump particle filter (MJPF) is employed for state estimation and abnormality detection in each agent using learned DBNs as filter parameters. Performance metrics are discussed to asses the algorithm's reliability and accuracy. The impact is also evaluated by the communication channel used by the network to share the data sensed in a distributed way by each agent of the network. The IEEE 802.11p protocol standard has been considered for communication among agents. Performances of the DBN-based abnormality detection models under different channel and source conditions are discussed. The effects of distances among agents and of the delays and packet losses are analyzed in different scenario categories (urban, suburban, and rural). Real data sets are also used acquired by autonomous vehicles performing different tasks in a controlled environment.

AB This paper presents a hybrid-driven underwater vehicle with ultra-wide speed range, which combines the conventional autonomous underwater glider with a shaftless propeller. By designs of low-resistance structures in wide speed range, the vehicle has a low-speed gliding mode within 3 kn driven by buoyancy, and a low-mediumhigh speed navigation mode up to 30 kn driven by the propeller. In order to analyze the effectiveness of the structure designs, an analysis method of the flow energy dissipation (FED) is proposed. By solving the cumulative function of the FED, this method can quantitatively characterize the influence of the vehicle's local structures on navigation power consumption. On this basis, the hydrodynamic numerical models for the two modes are established by the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods. The numerical analysis indicates that this vehicle has a good lift-drag ratio in glide mode and a superior fluidity in propelled mode. It can maintain low resistance and low power consumption in both modes. Finally, the numerical models are verified to be accurate by prototype tests. This vehicle can provide reference for the designs of the integrated underwater platform with wide speed range and multi missions.

AB In the following years, Urban Air Mobility (UAM) will transform the transport industry. Researching the intention to use air vehicles is not easy, as it is a new mode of transport that has not yet been implemented, so there are no available observed data. This fact is why the many gaps and uncertainties remain unexplored in academic research on this topic. The most critical issues for the successful implementation of a UAM transport system is public acceptance and user adoption. Based on technology adoption theories, this paper investigates critical constructs in generating usage intention to use urban air autonomous vehicles (UAAVs) and the mediator role of pro-environmental behavior and human values in this relationship. Covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) was used with a sample from the US and China. The results confirm that attitudes, perfor-mance expectancy, and social influence reinforce the intention to use UAAVs, while anxiety reduces it. The UAAV acceptance model is very similar between the Chinese and US populations. The only difference between the two samples is that social influence has a positive and significant effect on intention to use among US people. At the same time, this variable is not essential in the Chinese sample.

AB This paper develops an analytical framework to estimate commute accessibility and adoption of various ridehailing service concepts across the US by synthesizing individual commute trips using national Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) data. Focusing on potential improvements in cost and time that could be enabled by vehicle automation, we use this modeling framework to simulate a lower-price autonomous service (e.g., 50% or 75% lower) with variable wait times and implementation levels (solo, pooled, and first/last mile transit connections services, alone or in combination) to determine how they might affect adoption rates. These results are compared across metrics of accessibility and trip density, as well as socioeconomic factors such as household income. We find - unsurprisingly - that major cities (e.g. New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago) support the highest adoption rates for ridehailing services. Decreases in price tend to increase market share and accessibility. The effect of a decrease in price is more drastic for lower income groups. The proposed method for synthesizing trips using the LODES contributes to current travel demand forecasting methods and the proposed analytic framework can be flexibly implemented with any other mode choice model, extended to non-commute trips, or applied to different levels of geographic aggregation.

AB Real-time object detection with high accuracy is the measure concern for the autonomous vehicle to provide safety. Recently many state-of-the-art methods used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for object detection. Although these methods provide better results but still provide a trade-off between accuracy and real-time detection becomes challenging tasks. High accuracy ensures the vehicle for avoiding collisions and abide the traffic rules while the faster speed helps to make the decision quickly. In this paper, the single-shot object detection is provided faster results and the attention module helps to provide more accurate detection. The channel attention mechanism provides more grained refine features and emphasizes 'what' is a semantic part from a given input. Apart from the channel attention mechanisms, spatial attention emphasizes 'where' is meaningful information which is working as a booster for the attention block. The proposed model incorporates these two attention mechanisms sequentially such as channel (RGB-wise) as well spatial attention for single-shot object detection (CSA-SS). The proposed model is trained and tested using challenging datasets such as KITTI and Berkeley Deep Drive (BDD). The experimental result shows that the proposed model surpasses the state-of-the-art techniques by 1.66 and 1.13 mAP for the KITTI and BDD datasets.

AB Safety is one of the key requirements for automated vehicles and fault diagnosis is an effective technique to enhance the vehicle safety. The model-based fault diagnosis method models the fault into the system model and estimates the faults by observer. In this article, to avoid the complexity of designing observer, we investigate the problem of steering actuator fault diagnosis for automated vehicles based on the approach of model-based support vector machine (SVM) classification. The system model is utilized to generate the residual signal as the training data and the data-based algorithm of the SVM classification is employed to diagnose the fault. Due to the phenomena of data unbalance induced poor performance of the data-driven method, an undersampling procedure with the approach of linear discriminant analysis and a threshold adjustment using the algorithm of grey wolf optimizer are proposed to modify and improve the performance of classification and fault diagnosis. Various comparisons are carried out based on widely used datasets. The comparison results show that the proposed algorithm has superiority on the classification over existing methods. Experimental results and comparisons of an automated vehicle illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on the steering actuator fault diagnosis.

AB Path planning is a crucial technology for autonomous vehicle (AV). However, it is difficult to adapt to dynamic driving environment, and AV may lose lateral dynamic stability due to high speed and various friction. This paper presents an adaptive dynamic path planning method (ADPPM) for AV to address the challenges. The ADPPM is comprised of three components: 1) A dynamic state-fused steering decision method based on a hierarchical fuzzy inference system is designed to calculate the steering position of AV in each iteration step, and the method fuses the multi-state of the dynamic environment; 2) dynamic path optimization method is designed to reduce the mean curvature of the path based on the particle swarm optimization method, which improves the lateral dynamics stability of AV; 3) adaptive speed inference method is proposed to provide desired steering speed for AV according to various road friction and reduce AV's steering burden. The ADPPM provides path planning in the dynamic environment, and it also improves the stability of AV under various road friction and speeds. Finally, the proposed method is verified by CarSim.

AB Based on data-driven and mixed models, this study proposes a fault detection method for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) rudder systems. The proposed method can effectively detect faults in the absence of angle feedback from the rudder. Considering the parameter uncertainty of the AUV motion model resulting from the dynamics analysis method, we present a parameter identification method based on the recurrent neural network (RNN). Prior to identification, singular value decomposition (SVD) was chosen to denoise the original sensor data as the data pretreatment step. The proposed method provides more accurate predictions than recursive least squares (RLSs) and a single RNN. In order to reduce the influence of sensor parameter errors and prediction model errors, the adaptive threshold is mentioned as a method for analyzing prediction errors. In the meantime, the results of the threshold analysis were combined with the qualitative force analysis to determine the rudder system's fault diagnosis and location. Experiments conducted at sea demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB In this paper, the desired yaw orientation for an autonomous underwater vehicle is attained by acquiring a cascaded control structure based on a robust optimal control algorithm with a backstepping approach. A robust state feedback optimal control law is designed to control the yaw rate. Hence, the desired yaw rate is intended to be obtained by the backstepping controller by controlling the desired yaw orientation. The implementation of the proposed robust control algorithm is formulated by using semi-definite programming. A linear quadratic regulator in terms of linear matrix inequality is designed to address the control problem. The design of robust optimal control law in the steering plane is achieved by considering an uncertain polytopic AUV system. Realization of the proposed control algorithm is conducted in MATLAB/Simulink environment using the YALMIP tool. Robust behavior is ensured by the proposed control algorithm while tracking the desired yaw. The robustness analysis is extended by considering the various ranges of specific uncertain parameters to highlight the efficacies of the proposed control algorithm.

ID DYNAMIC SURFACE CONTROL
AB A finite-time self-structuring neural network (SSNN) trajectory tracking control scheme is proposed for an input constrained underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with unknown external disturbances. First, a time-varying barrier Lyapunov function is proposed to constrain and prevent excessive consistency errors and reduce computational effort. Second, a finite-time controller is presented to achieve finite-time convergence of the closed-loop system, while dynamic surface control (DSC) is used to reduce the computational complexity of the system. Third, a finite-time SSNN method is developed to obtain the optimal number of neurons with simple computation and better approximation to estimate uncertain disturbances. Moreover, the Lyapunov stability proof indicates that all signals in the closed-loop system are ultimately bounded uniformly with respect to the initial constraints, and the trajectory tracking errors can converge to near zero in a finite time. Finally, simulations not only evaluate the performance of the proposed controller-controlled system but also verify the effectiveness of the methodology in this paper.

AB Automated visual data collection using autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can improve the accessibility and accuracy of the frequent data required for indoor construction inspections and tracking. However, robust localization, as a critical enabler for autonomy, is challenging in ever-changing, cluttered, GPS-denied indoor construction environments. Rapid alterations and repetitive low-texture areas on indoor construction sites jeopardize the reliability of typical vision-based solutions. This research proposes a tag-based visual-inertial localization method for off-the-shelf UAVs with only a camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Given that tag locations are known in the BIM, the proposed method estimates the UAV's global pose by fusing inertial data and tag measurements using an on-manifold extended Kalman filter (EKF). The root-mean-square error (RMSE) achieved in our experiments in laboratory and simulation, being as low as 2 - 5 cm, indicates the potential of deploying the proposed method for autonomous navigation of low-cost UAVs in indoor construction environments.

AB The transition of autonomous vehicles into fleets requires an advanced control system design that relies on continuous feedback from the tires. Smart tires enable continuous monitoring of dynamic parameters by combining strain sensing with traditional tire functions. Here, we provide breakthrough in this direction by demonstrating tire-integrated system that combines direct mask-less 3D printed strain gauges, flexible piezoelectric energy harvester for powering the sensors and secure wireless data transfer electronics, and machine learning for predictive data analysis. Ink of graphene based material was designed to directly print strain sensor for measuring tire-road interactions under varying driving speeds, normal load, and tire pressure. A secure wireless data transfer hardware powered by a piezoelectric patch is implemented to demonstrate self-powered sensing and wireless communication capability. Combined, this study significantly advances the design and fabrication of cost-effective smart tires by demonstrating practical self-powered wireless strain sensing capability. Designing efficient sensors for smart tires for autonomous vehicles remains a challenge. Here, the authors present a tire-integrated system that combines direct mask-less 3D printed strain gauges, flexible piezoelectric energy harvester for powering the sensors and secure wireless data transfer electronics, and machine learning for predictive data analysis.

AB Recent advances in transducer and computing technology have pushed the concept of continuous active sonar (CAS) or high duty cycle sonar as an area of interest for application to antisubmarine warfare. Unlike conventional pulsed active sonars, CAS processing aims at detecting echoes while transmitting with a nearly 100 % duty cycle. This paper describes the signal processing chain developed at the Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE), La Spezia, Italy, for real-time CAS processing within an autonomous networked multistatic sonar system. The algorithm uses subband processing, which can potentially provide a higher target update rate than the traditional pulsed active sonar, while maintaining the same search radius. The higher rate of contact information can improve target tracking performance. Performance results are given from the COLLAB-NGAS14 sea trial where the CAS processor was deployed on two autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) acting as receivers of the CMRE experimental multistatic demonstrator. Results show the feasibility of the CAS concept in littoral scenarios, using AUVs as real-time receivers.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have been extensively used for open-sea exploration. However, the mapping or inspection of complex underwater structures, which have an interest from the scientific and the industrial point of view, is still carried out by professional divers or remotely operated vehicles. We propose a probabilistic next-best-view planner, targeted to hover-capable AUVs, that will allow them to explore these complex environments without an a priori model. The proposed method is based on scanning the area from different viewpoints in an iterative way. At each step, a viewpoint is chosen from a set of random samples according to a utility function. An obstacle-free path to the selected viewpoint is planned, and the vehicle navigates to it to gather a new scan that will be registered with the previous ones. To evaluate the proposed method, we present four different tests using the Girona 500 AUV, both in simulation and in real scenarios. The results demonstrate the capability to explore complex environments autonomously, producing models of the environment with a high degree of coverage that can enable mapping and inspection applications.

AB As the mission needs of the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) have become increasingly varied and complex, the AUVs are developing in the direction of systematism, multifunction, and clustering technology, which promotes the progress of key technologies and proposes a series of technical problems. Therefore, it is necessary to make systemic analysis and in-depth study for the progress of AUV's key technologies and innovative applications. The multi-functional mission needs and its key technologies involved in complex sea conditions are pointed out through analyzing the domestic and foreign technical programs, functional characteristics and future development plans. Furthermore, the overall design of a multi-moving state AUV is proposed. Then, technical innovations of the key technologies, such as thrust vector, propeller design, kinematics and dynamics, navigation control, and ambient flow field characteristics, are made, combining with the structural characteristics and motion characteristics of the new multi-moving state AUV.

AB Simulated navigations of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) achieved by the minimum time guidance within undersea areas of current disturbances are presented. When an AUV has to transit to a given destination within an area of current disturbance, ingenious guidance enables the minimum time navigation. In this study, a numerical solution procedure for an optimal heading guidance law is developed. As the optimal heading reference, the solution of the optimal guidance law is fed to the heading controller. Simulated optimal navigations are realized on the basis of the dynamics of an AUV 'r2D4'. The r2D4 is a deep-ocean-exploring AUV, developed by the Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo. The developed procedure never fails to derive the optimal heading sequence within a finite computational time, provided that the current velocity in the navigation region is known a priori. As a fail-safe strategy in achieving the optimal navigation, the concept of quasi-optimal navigation is presented. The quasi-optimal navigation is implemented by on-site updates of optimal guidances followed by the heading tracking control. (c) Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden and The Robotics Society of Japan, 2009

AB This paper adopts Genetic Algorithm (GA) -driven optimisation framework to solve the design optimisation problem of an autonomous underwater vehicle that aims to minimise the delivered power under the constraints on the geometric parameters that define the hull shape. The GA and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers are seamlessly integrated into a single code so that it becomes an effective computational tool for optimisation. Adopting a hull and a ducted propeller, for which some experimental data are available for CFD validation, the optimisation is done for the shape of the hull for a single velocity, leading to significant reduction in delivered power. The hull shape is described by a 5-parameter axisymmetric form. Delivered power minimisation problem is compared with the corresponding drag minimisation problem of the chosen hull.

AB The control of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is regarded as a difficult challenge, owing to the nonlinear and uncertain dynamics of the AUV. In this work, Optimized neural network (NN) is integrated with the "second-order sliding mode control (SoSMC) approach" for control of yaw angle in AUV. More particularly, the positive gain of SoSMC is predicted by an optimized NN model, where the training is performed by a novel Sea Lion Distance-based FireFly algorithm via tuning the optimal weights. At last, the supremacy of the adopted model is validated under various measures. Accordingly, the RMSE values accomplished by the proposed model is 40.94%, 1.39%, 0.69%, 0.69% and 0.41% better than existing models like "GW-SMC, FF-SoSMC, SLnO-SoSMC, POA-SoSMC and GW-SoSMC", respectively, for set point 1.

AB The automated steering control technology is crucial for autonomous vehicles, and lane-keeping control systems have been developed extensively, but various traffic conditions, and obstacles ahead of the ego vehicle would cause serious traffic collision accidents. Therefore, this paper proposes a virtual fluid-flow-model (VFFM) based lane-keeping integrated with collision avoidance control system (LKCA) to realize the function of both lane-keeping and collision avoidance. Firstly, a novel lane-keeping model is proposed which is inspired by viscous fluid flowing between two parallel plates or around a cylinder. Then, based on the proposed VFFM-based lane-keeping model, the ego vehicle's path can be planned, and it ensures the performance of lane-keeping and obstacle-avoidance. Finally, an optimal-preview-driver-model-based path tracking controller is designed to track the desired VFFM-based path. The proposed control system is evaluated by both co-simulations of MATLAB/Simulink & CarSim and real-bus tests. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed control system, and it can ensure lane-keeping performance on the premise of obstacle-avoidance.

AB This article describes the development of an unmanned aerial vehicle system that had a remarkable performance in the 6th International Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Innovation Grand Prix, which was held on November 2-4, 2018, in Anji, China. The main mission of the competition was to build a simulated tower using prefabricated components by an unmanned rotorcraft, which could be decomposed into the following four subtasks: (1) navigation and control, (2) recognition and location, (3) grasp and construction, and (4) task planning and scheduling. All the tasks were required to perform autonomously without human intervention. According to the requirement of the mission, the unmanned aerial vehicle system was designed and implemented with high degree of autonomy and reliability, whose hardware was developed on a quadrotor platform by integrating various system components, including sensors, computers, power, and grasp mechanism. Software algorithms were exploited, and executable computer codes were implemented and integrated with the developed unmanned aerial vehicle hardware system. Integration of the two provided onboard intelligence to complete the mission. This article addresses the major components and development process of the unmanned aerial vehicle system and describes its applications to the competition mission.

AB In this paper we propose a framework for semi-autonomous operation of an under-actuated underwater vehicle. The contributions of this paper are twofold: The first contribution is a visual servoing control scheme that is designed to provide a human operator the capability to steer the vehicle without loosing the target from the vision system's field of view. It is shown that the under-actuated degree of freedom is input-to-state stable (ISS) and a shaping of the user input with stability guarantees is implemented. The resulting control scheme has formally guaranteed stability and convergence properties. The second contribution is an asynchronous Modified Dual Unscented Kalman Filter (MDUKF) for the on-line state and parameter estimation of the vehicle by fusing data from a Laser Vision System (LVS) and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). The MDUKF has been developed in order to experimentally verify the performance of the proposed visual servoing control scheme.
   Experimental results of the visual servoing control scheme integrated with the asynchronous MDUKF indicate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed con-trol scheme. Experiments have been carried out on a small under-actuated Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) in a test tank.

AB Unmanned network-flying vehicles (UNFVs), regarded as special remote-sensing platforms, are affected by attitude maneuvering, gravity, climatic change, and atmospheric turbulence. To improve the positioning precision of the UNFVs and accomplish autonomous navigation in the case of communication and/or tracking failure, a tracking positioning algorithm with joint space-time constraints (PAST) is proposed. In particular, the adaptive truncated normal distribution model is adopted to describe the distribution of the vehicle maneuvering acceleration with reduced delay effect of the vehicle tracking. Then, according to the spatial correlation of the UNFVs in adjacent moment, a spatial adjustment datum is combined with a time-domain strong tracking filter by Lagrange method of multipliers. As such, the rank deficiency in the measurement equation is resolved while the spatial correlation of the UNFV tracking enhanced. Furthermore, for the autonomous navigation of the UNFVs which depends little on the Earth-or satellite-based tracking, telemetry, and command, we utilize an "anchor" technology to further improve the PAST algorithm. Monte Carlo simulation results show that, compared with existing positioning methods, the proposed algorithm may continuously track sudden motion, rapidly respond to network communication failure, and greatly increase positioning precision for slowly moving vehicles.

ID CONTROL STRATEGY; MOBILE ROBOT
AB The path tracking control system is a crucial component for autonomous vehicles; it is challenging to realize accurate tracking control when approaching a wide range of uncertain situations and dynamic environments, particularly when such control must perform as well as, or better than, human drivers. While many methods provide state-of-the-art tracking performance, they tend to emphasize constant PID control parameters, calibrated by human experience, to improve tracking accuracy. A detailed analysis shows that PID controllers inefficiently reduce the lateral error under various conditions, such as complex trajectories and variable speed. In addition, intelligent driving vehicles are highly non-linear objects, and high-fidelity models are unavailable in most autonomous systems. As for the model-based controller (MPC or LQR), the complex modeling process may increase the computational burden. With that in mind, a self-optimizing, path tracking controller structure, based on reinforcement learning, is proposed. For the lateral control of the vehicle, a steering method based on the fusion of the reinforcement learning and traditional PID controllers is designed to adapt to various tracking scenarios. According to the pre-defined path geometry and the real-time status of the vehicle, the interactive learning mechanism, based on an RL framework (actor-critic-a symmetric network structure), can realize the online optimization of PID control parameters in order to better deal with the tracking error under complex trajectories and dynamic changes of vehicle model parameters. The adaptive performance of velocity changes was also considered in the tracking process. The proposed controlling approach was tested in different path tracking scenarios, both the driving simulator platforms and on-site vehicle experiments have verified the effects of our proposed self-optimizing controller. The results show that the approach can adaptively change the weights of PID to maintain a tracking error (simulation: within +/- 0.071 m; realistic vehicle: within +/- 0.272 m) and steering wheel vibration standard deviations (simulation: within +/- 0.04 degrees; realistic vehicle: within +/- 80.69 degrees); additionally, it can adapt to high-speed simulation scenarios (the maximum speed is above 100 km/h and the average speed through curves is 63-76 km/h).

AB In this article, we present a comprehensive design and implementation for a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) that is able to perform 3-D autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance in cluttered and realistic unknown environments without the aid of global positioning system and other external sensors or markers. To achieve these autonomous missions, modularized components are developed for the MAV, including visual-inertial odometry, 3-D occupancy mapping, and motion planning. The proposed system is implemented to run on a small embedded computer in real time. It is demonstrated to be robust in both simulation and real flight experiments. The demonstration video is available at: https://youtu.be/KUKzsnORm-4.

TI LEADER FOLLOWER FORMATION CONTROL FOR UNDERWATER TRANSPORTATION USING

ID CONTROL-SYSTEM; TRACKING; ROV
AB The successful ability to conduct underwater transportation using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is important for the commercial sector to undertake precise underwater installations on large modules, whilst for the military sector it has the added advantage of improved secrecy for clandestine operations. The technical requirements are the stability of the payload and internal collision avoidance while keeping track of the desired trajectory considering the underwater effects. Here, a leader-follower formation control strategy was developed and implemented on the transportation system of AUVs. PID controllers were used for the vehicles and a linear feedback controller for maintaining the formation. A Kalman Filter (KF) was designed to estimate the full state of the leader under disturbance, noise and limited sensor readings. The results demonstrate that though the technical requirements are met, the thrust oscillations under disturbance and noise produce the undesired heading angles.

ID RECOGNITION
AB The autonomous driving technology requires reliable detection and prediction of the surrounding environment. Predicting the lane change intention of the surrounding traffic is critical to evaluate the potential threat around the host vehicle. This paper develops a lane change maneuver prediction algorithm based on a newly proposed driver model combined with a Bayesian network. The innovation of the proposed algorithm is the utilization of the driver model while calibrating and executing the Bayesian network. The prediction algorithm can provide not only the driver's intention but also the probability associated with the intention. The Next-Generation Simulation data sets are used to develop and validate the prediction model. In total, there are more than 2000 lane change events used in this paper. The result shows that the proposed prediction algorithm can provide an accurate prediction of the surrounding vehicle's lane change maneuver.

DE Underwater acoustic sensor networks; Autonomous underwater vehicles;
   Underwater gliders; Team formation; Team steering
AB In order to take measurements in space and time from the undersampled vast ocean, it is necessary to employ multiple autonomous underwater vehicles, such as gliders, that communicate and coordinate with each other. These vehicles need to form a team in a specific formation, steer through the 3D region of interest, and take application-dependent measurements such as temperature and salinity. In this article, team formation and steering algorithms relying on underwater acoustic communications are proposed in order to enable glider swarming that is robust against ocean currents and acoustic channel impairments (e.g., high propagation and transmission delay, and low communication reliability). Performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated and compared against existing solutions, which do not rely on underwater communications, using different ocean current models.

AB For logistics centers the disposition and dispatch of goods has reached a high standard of automation. However, the trucks and trailers bringing and taking wares are driven manually. This offers a enormous potential for automation for the yards of logistics centers. The availability of this potential is correlated to the autonomous forward and backward motion control for standard transportation vehicles. By an experimental system it has been shown that truck and trailer can be maneuvered autonomously at a high degree of precision. For purposes of safety it is necessary to guarantee that at any instant of time the vehicle is within some predefined area. Therefore, this paper introduces the principle of safe cover segments which are never left by the vehicle in motion and defines rules for the connection of such segments forming a safe corridor.

AB Recent advancements in Intelligent Transportation Systems have endowed vehicles with autonomous driving capabilities as well as V2X communication. Vehicular networks allow vehicles to augment their perception range beyond Line of Sight conditions, enabling novel strategies for effective conflict resolution in challenging scenarios (e.g. platooning) making use of (Multi-Agent System [MAS]) coordination mechanisms (e.g. voting). Simulation-based evaluation of coordination mechanisms should consider real-world constraints, such as kinematics and communication constraints (e.g. packet loss). To this effect, this paper presents a simulation framework that unifies vehicular, communications and MAS simulators in order to test more effectively and realistically these mechanisms. The framework is benchmarked using a lane-merging and platoon voting scenario. Results show the scalability of the framework and the capability to model coordination mechanisms in next to real-world conditions.

AB This paper reports on a Naval Engineering Education Center (NEEC) design-build-test project that focused on the development of a fully autonomous system for landing Navy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on transiting ships at sea. A NEEC team of engineering students researched image processing techniques, estimation frameworks, and control algorithms to collaboratively learn and train in Navy-relevant autonomy. We accomplished the autonomous landing using fiducial markers detected by a camera onboard the UAV, decomposed the resulting homography into six degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) relative-pose information between the UAV and landing platform, performed state estimation with a delayed-state extended Kalman filter, and then executed the motion control. Results for the state estimation framework and experimental tests using a motion capture system for independent ground-truth are presented. The proposed system performed successfully on a robotic testbed consisting of a micro UAV and an unmanned ground vehicle.

AB The omni-directional inspection system (ODIS) is a small, man-portable mobile robotic system that can be used for autonomous or semi-autonomous inspection under vehicles in a parking area. Customers for such a system include military police (NIP) and other law enforcement and security entities. The robot features three "smart wheels" in which both the speed and direction of the wheel can be independently controlled and a vehicle electronic capability that includes multiple processors and a sensor array with a laser, sonar and IR sensors, and a video camera. ODIS employs a novel parameterized command language for intelligent behavior generation. A key feature of the ODIS control system is the use of an object recognition system that fits models to sensor data. These models are then used as input parameters to the motion and behavior control commands. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we propose an assisted driving system implemented with a Jetson nano-high-performance embedded platform by using machine vision and deep learning technologies. The vehicle dynamics model is established under multiconditional assumptions, the path planner and path tracking controller are designed based on the model predictive control algorithm, and the local desired path is reasonably planned in combination with the behavioral decision system. The behavioral decision algorithm based on finite state machine reasonably transforms the driving state according to the environmental changes, realizes the following of the target vehicle speed, and can take effective emergency braking in time when there is a collision danger. The system can complete the motion planning by the model predictive control algorithm and control the autonomous vehicle to smoothly track the replanned local desired path to complete the lane change overtaking action, which can meet the demand of ADAS. The path planner is designed based on the MPC algorithm, solving the objective function with obstacle avoidance function, planning the optimal path that can avoid a collision, and using 5th order polynomial to fit the output local desired path points. In 5 similar to 8 s time, the target vehicle decelerates to 48 km/h; the autonomous vehicle immediately makes a deceleration action and gradually reduces the speed difference between the two vehicles until it reaches the target speed, at which time the distance between the two vehicles is close to the safe distance, obtained by the simulation test results. The system can still accurately track the target when the vehicle is driving on a curve and timely control the desired speed change of the vehicle, and the target vehicle always maintains a safe distance. The system can be used within 50 meters.

AB In this article, a novel distributed model predictive control architecture is proposed for the coordination and control of multivehicle formations moving within uncertain environments. As one of its main merits, multiagent swarm modeling and leader-follower configurations are jointly exploited within an ad hoc model predictive control framework to reduce as much as possible the use of onboard sensors that is essential in long-range missions. Moreover, the feasibility and asymptotic closed-loop stability of the resulting scheme are formally proved. Finally, a laboratory experiment is used to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with particular attention to the follower capability of operating in a so-called blind fashion.

AB Lane keeping control needs to achieve smooth steering operation while ensuring safety & x2014;no lane departures and maintain small lateral displacement. In this paper, we solve this challenge by developing a preview lane keeping control supervised by a safeguard controller. The preview control utilizes both tracking errors and future lane curvatures to generate the optimal steering commands. The safeguard controller is then designed to guarantee bounded tracking errors. It supervises the preview control and intervenes if and only if the tracking error is approaching the safety boundary. Both algorithms have analytical control laws and thus require little on-line computations. The integrated system is compared with a model predictive control (MPC) design in terms of both tracking performance and computing efficiency. We implemented the proposed controls on a self-driving vehicle platform and tested on open roads and in the Mcity test facility.

AB In this paper, a tracking algorithm for the autonomous navigation of the automated guided vehicles (AGVs) operated in a container terminal is investigated. The navigation system is based on sensors that detect range and bearing. The navigation algorithm used is an interacting multiple model algorithm to detect other AGVs and avoid obstacles using information obtained from the multiple sensors. In order to detect other AGVs (or obstacles), two kinematic models are derived : A constant velocity model for linear motion and a constant-speed turn model for curvilinear motion. For the constant-speed turn model, an unscented Kalman filter is used because of the drawbacks of the extended Kalman filter in nonlinear systems. The suggested algorithm reduces the root mean squares error for linear motions and rapidly detects possible turning motions.

AB The availability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on the market will create a novel situation for every stakeholder. A lot of research has been conducted on developing the AVs and the consequences of having AVs on the market, but comprehensive studies concerning various viewpoints on the introduction of AVs into the market can be scarcely found. This research is examining different actors' viewpoints on the acceptance of privately shared autonomous vehicles (PSAVs). Four groups of stakeholders are identified as the following: users, legislators, operators, and manufacturers. The multi-actor multi-criteria analysis (MAMCA) is used, where the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and the parsimonious AHP (PAHP)methods are applied to evaluate each actor's objectives and criteria. From each group, a representative sample is collected, the actors evaluate a set of pairwise comparison matrices (PCMs), and their consistency is continuously checked. As a result, the objectives and the criteria are ranked and presented. The main finding of the objectives' analysis presents that the safety concerns receive the highest ranking (i.e., weight is 0.085), while the ease of use and the intemperability across the borders have the lowest rankings ((i.e., weight is 0.048, and 0.0515, respectively). The main finding of criteria's analysis shows that ease of use has the lowest ranking (i.e., weight is 0.0024), and the highest rank is related to the reduction in vehicle accidents caused by the malfunction (i.e., weight is 0.0495). Thus, it seems that safety related issues are the most important factor in accepting PSAV. The result of this study is useful for decision-makers and transport planners to form policies, regulations, and guidelines regarding the future implementations of PSAVs before their arrival to the market.

AB In addressing the morphing problem in vehicle flight, some scholars have primarily employed reinforcement learning methods to make morphing decisions based on task. However, they have not considered the constraints associated with the task process. The innovation of this article is that it proposes an intelligent morphing decision method based on deep neural networks (DNNs) for the autonomous morphing decision problem of hypersonic boost-glide morphing vehicles under process constraints. Firstly, we established a dynamic model of a hypersonic boost-glide morphing vehicle with a continuously variable sweep angle. Then, in order to address the decision optimality problem considering errors and the heat flux density constraint problem during the gliding process, interference was introduced to the datum trajectory in segments. Subsequently, re-optimization was performed to generate a trajectory sample library, which was used to train an intelligent decision-maker using a DNN. The simulation results demonstrated that, compared with the conventional programmatic morphing approach, the intelligent morphing decision maker could dynamically determine the sweep angle based on the current flight state, leading to improved range while still adhering to the heat flux density constraint. This validates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed intelligent decision-maker.

AB Autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RSs) are widely used in e-commerce warehouses due to their high throughput and flexibility. In such systems, storage and retrieval transactions are performed by lifts and vehicles. This paper focuses on the sequencing retrievals problem in an AVS/RS, which is an important problem for daily operations. We formulate this sequencing problem as a mixed-integer program to determine a retrieval sequence for the lift and the vehicles, one that minimises the makespan. A dynamic programming approach is proposed to solve the sequencing problem to optimality. However, the solution time of the dynamic programming method is exponentially increasing in the number of retrieval requests. To be more practical, we present a beam search heuristic that can solve large-sized instances in reasonable time. Computational experiments verify that near-optimal solutions can be found by the beam search heuristic. Compared to commonly used heuristics and straightforward heuristics, the beam search decreases the makespan by up to 15%. Finally, we analyse how vehicle modes impact the makespan, showing evidence that a small makespan can be achieved when considering a realistic mode of vehicles.

We consider a fleet of cars distributed at specified stations in an industrial area to supply internal transportation, where the cars can be used in different modes of circulation (tram mode, elevator mode, taxi mode). We treat in this paper the pickup and delivery problem related to the taxi mode by means of flows in time-expanded networks. This enables us to compute optimal offline solutions, to propose strategies for the online situation, and to evaluate their performance in comparison with the optimal offline solution.

A fault-tolerant system consists of three areas: fault detection, fault isolation and fault accommodation. Each area is described, and methods discussed in the literature are briefly reviewed. The presented design focuses on the thruster (or actuator) and sensor system failures in an AUV. Experimental results show that the presented approach is practical and effective when tolerable failures in actuators and sensors occur. This methodology and concept can be extended to fault-tolerant system design for various AUVs with hardware redundancy.

AB As partially automated driving vehicles are set to be mass produced, there is an increased necessity to research situations where such partially automated vehicles become unable to drive. Automated vehicles at SAE Level 3 cannot avoid a take-over between the human driver and vehicle system. Therefore, how the system alerts a human driver is essential in situations where the vehicle autonomous driving system is taken over. The present study delivered a take-over transition alert to human drivers using diverse combinations of visual, auditory, and haptic modalities and analyzed the drivers' brainwave data. To investigate the differences in indexes according to the take-over transition alert type, the independent variable of this study, the nonparametric test of Kruskal-Wallis was performed along with Mann-Whitney as a follow-up test. Moreover, the pre/post-warning difference in each index was investigated, and the results were reflected in ranking effective warning combinations and their resulting scores. The visual-auditory-haptic warning scored the highest in terms of various EEG indexes, to be the most effective type of take-over transition alert. Unlike most preceding studies analyzing post-take-over-alert human drivers' response times or vehicle behavior, this study investigates drivers' brainwave after the take-over warning.

The received messages should be authenticated so that messages from malicious or malfunctioning entities can be detected and discarded. However, this requirement poses a challenge in terms of location privacy, since the user's identity is sent in clear text in the transmitted messages, and thus it can be linked to the vehicle's position. Cryptographic pseudonyms are advocated as computationally efficient solutions for preserving the privacy of vehicles' location. However, pseudonym-based systems require permanent contact between vehicles and a trusted authority (TA) to periodically renew the pseudonyms. This might cause network congestion or be infeasible in some situations due to the lack or scarcity of deployed infrastructure. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing an autonomous privacy-preserving authentication scheme, where vehicles only need to contact the TA once; afterward, they can renew their pseudonyms by themselves without communicating with the TA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first authentication scheme providing vehicles with the capability to renew their pseudonym sets without requiring permanent contact with a TA.

AB Intelligent vehicles is an application in which the words "intelligent autonomous systems" represent not only an important research topic but also a strategic solution to the mobility problems of the coming years. Vehicles that can move autonomously and navigate in everyday traffic, in highway;urban, and unstructured scenarios, will become a reality in the next decades. Besides the obvious advantages of increasing road safety and improving the quality and efficiency of people and goods mobility, the integration of intelligent features and autonomous functionalities on vehicles will lead to major economic benefits from reduced fuel consumption, efficient exploitation of the road network and reduced personnel. Furthermore, not only the automotive field (public transportation, trucks, and automobiles) is interested in these new technologies. but also other sectors, each with its own target (industrial vehicles, military systems, mission-critical systems, and unmanned rescue robots).
   In this second issue of the TTS department-written in cooperation with the IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Council-Richard Bishop surveys the major intelligent vehicles projects and activities worldwide, covering not only automotive applications hut also special vehicles.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE; ARCTIC PRESSURE RIDGE; MORPHOLOGY
AB In April 2007 the first three-dimensional digital terrain mapping of the underside of sea ice to be done from an ice-launched autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) was carried out at an ice camp in the Beaufort Sea using the Gavia vehicle, which could be launched and recovered through 3 x 1 m holes. Gavia was equipped with a GeoSwath 500 kHz interferometric sonar system, which yielded swaths of typical width 80 m. The imagery showed the morphological distinctions between first-year (FY) and multi-year (MY) ice undersides, the contrast between the shapes of FYand MY ridges, and the appearance of refrozen leads. Ice drafts were validated by drilling, and it was found that ridge slope statistics and local probability density functions (PDFs) of draft could be derived with high precision. The special opportunities offered by access to 3-D mapping are pointed out.

AB This paper presents a processing concept for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-based concurrent detection and classification (CDAC) of mine-like objects. In the detection phase, the AUV seeks objects of interest using a simple energy detector combined with a peak tracking mechanism. Upon detection, the processing mechanism changes to a higher order spectral (HOS) classification process. The system is demonstrated through theory, simulation and at-sea experiments to have promise in reducing the false alarm rate of mine detections. The HOS classification mechanism is also shown to have some benefit over classical spectral estimation in all cases. Components of the system concept were also demonstrated live onboard the AUV during the Generic Oceanographic Array Technology Sonar (GOATS 2002) experiment off the coast of Italy, while others are demonstrated using a comprehensive AUV sonar simulation framework.

LA English
DT Article
AB Intersections are hazardous places. Threats arise from interactions among pedestrians, bicycles and vehicles, more complicated vehicle trajectories in the absence of lane markings, phases that prevent determining who has the right of way, invisible vehicle approaches, vehicle obstructions, and illegal movements. These challenges are not fully addressed by the "road diet" and road redesign prescribed in Vision Zero plans, nor will they be completely overcome by autonomous vehicles with their many sensors and tireless attention to surroundings. Accidents can also occur because drivers, cyclists and pedestrians do not have the information they need to avoid wrong decisions. In these cases, the missing information can be computed and broadcast by an intelligent intersection. The information gives the current full signal phase, an estimate of the time when the phase will change, and the occupancy of the blind spots of the driver or autonomous vehicle. The paper develops a design of the intelligent intersection, motivated by the analysis of an accident at an intersection in Tempe, AZ, between an automated Uber Volvo and a manual Honda CRV and culminates in a proposal for an intelligent intersection infrastructure. The intelligent intersection also serves as a software-enabled version of the 'protected intersection' design to improve the passage of cyclists and pedestrians through an intersection.

AB Interest in control of multiple autonomous vehicles continues to grow for applications such as weather monitoring, geographical mapping fauna surveys, and extra-terrestrial exploration. The task of persistent surveillance is of particular significance in that the target area needs to be continuously surveyed, minimizing the time between visitations to the same region. This distinction from one-time coverage does not allow a straightforward application of most exploration techniques to the problem, though ideas from these methods can still be used. The aerial vehicle dynamic and endurance constraints add additional complexity to the autonomous control problem, whereas stochastic environments and vehicle failures introduce uncertainty. In this work, we investigate techniques for high-level control, that are scalable, reliable, efficient, and robust to problem dynamics. Next, we suggest a modification to the control policy to account for aircraft dynamic constraints. We also devise a health monitoring policy and a control policy modification to improve performance under endurance constraints. The Vehicle Swarm Technology Laboratory-a hardware testbed developed at Boeing Research and Technology, Seattle, WA, for evaluating a swarm of unmanned air vehicles-is then described, and these control policies are tested in a realistic scenario.

AB Background: Since the late 19th century, city planners have struggled to cope with new types of urban transport and mobility that threatened the existing system, or even rendered it obsolete.
   Purpose: As city planners confront the range of disruptive urban mobilities currently on the horizon, this paper explores how we can draw on a vast body of evidence to anticipate and avoid unintended consequences to people's health and wellbeing.
   Methods: This commentary involved a rapid review of the literature on transport disruption.
   Results: We found that to avoid the unintended consequences of disruption, research, policy and practice must think beyond single issues (such as the risk of chronic disease, injury, or traffic management) and consider the broader consequences of interventions. For example, although autonomous vehicles will probably reduce road trauma, what will be the negative consequences for physical inactivity, sedentary behavior, chronic disease, land use, traffic congestion and commuting patterns? Research is needed that considers and informs how to mitigate the range of potential harms caused by disruptive mobilities.
   Conclusion: In the face of new disruptive mobilities, we must: (a) draw on existing evidence to shape new regulations that address the 'who, when and where' rules of introducing new mobilities (such as electric assisted bicycles (e-bikes) and scooters (e-scooters)) of which the health repercussions can be easily anticipated; (b) monitor and evaluate the implementation of any interventions through natural experiment studies; and (c) use innovative research methods (such as agent-based simulation and health-impact-assessment modelling) to assess the likely effects of emerging disruptive mobilities (e.g., autonomous vehicles) on health and wellbeing and on the environment.

AB Trajectory planning is of vital importance to decision-making for autonomous vehicles. Currently, there are three popular classes of cost-based trajectory planning methods: sampling-based, graph-search-based, and optimization-based. However, each of them has its own shortcomings, for example, high computational expense for sampling-based methods, low resolution for graph-search-based methods, and lack of global awareness for optimization-based methods. It leads to one of the challenges for trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles, which is improving planning efficiency while guaranteeing model feasibility. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid planning framework composed of two modules, which preserves the strength of both graph-search-based methods and optimization-based methods, thus enabling faster and smoother spatio-temporal trajectory planning in constrained dynamic environment. The proposed method first constructs spatio-temporal driving space based on directed acyclic graph and efficiently searches a spatio-temporal trajectory using the improved A* algorithm. Then taking the search result as reference, locally convex feasible driving area is designed and model predictive control is applied to further optimize the trajectory with a comprehensive consideration of vehicle kinematics and moving obstacles. Results simulated in four different scenarios all demonstrated feasible trajectories without emergency stop or abrupt steering change, which is kinematic-smooth to follow. Moreover, the average planning time was 31 ms, which only took 59.05%, 18.87%, and 0.69%, respectively, of that consumed by other state-of-the-art trajectory planning methods, namely, maximum interaction defensive policy, sampling-based method with iterative optimizations, and Graph-search-based method with Dynamic Programming.

ID RECOGNITION
AB In recent times, Autonomous Moving Platforms (AMP) have been a vital component for various industrial sectors across the globe as they include a diverse set of aerial, marine, and land-based vehicles. The emergence and the rise of AMP necessitate a precise object-level understanding of the environment, which directly impacts the functioning like decision making, speed control, and direction of the autonomous driving vehicles. Obstacle detection and object classification are the key issues in the AMP. The autonomous vehicle is designed to move in the city roads and it should be bolstered with high-quality object detection/segmentation mechanisms since inaccurate movements and speed limits can prove to be fatal. Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, in this paper, we present upsilon inspect (velocity-inspect), an AI-based 5G enabled object segmentation and speed limit identification scheme for self-driving cars on the city roads. In upsilon inspect, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based semantic image segmentation is carried out to segment the objects as interpreted from the Cityscapes dataset. Then, object clustering is done using the K-Means approach based on the number of unique objects. The semantic segmentation is done over 12 classes and the model outshines concerning state-of-theart approaches for various parameters like latency, high accuracy of 82.2%, and others. Further, K-Means clustering based Speed Range Analyser (SRA) is proposed to determine the acceptable and safe speed range for the vehicle, which is computed based on the object density of every object in the environment. The results show that the proposed scheme outperforms compared to traditional schemes in terms of latency and accuracy.

AB Nowadays, the rural population is still dependent on motorized individual transportation due to the little offers of public transport there. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to close this mobility gap as shifting the task of driving from humans to machines facilitates new possibilities for vehicle sharing and lifts economical and service time limitations (e.g., labor costs and working hour regulations). However, mobility service operators are then probably responsible for serving the holistic travel demands of users. This might involve interrelated trips, where users ask for simultaneous arrival at meeting locations, where round trips involve a stay time at some destination locations, or the like. Accordingly, in this work, we present a problem variant of the dial-a-ride problem that allows for interrelated trips. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer program and propose an adaptive variable neighborhood search heuristic (AVNS) based on a sophisticated solution representation. Our computational results for instances considering characteristics of rural areas reveal that the heuristic performs very well and that it is clearly superior to standard MIP solvers. We further investigate the impact of different types of trip interrelations on the solvability of the problem, service quality, and total transportation costs of the solutions. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB The novel semi-autonomous vehicles are becoming a reality in our roads, being a very important technological advance with promising operational and safety improvements. However, road infrastructure must be ready to host them. The technologies of these driving automation systems require certain road conditions that are not always fulfilled, causing the systems to fail. These failures generally transfer negotiation control to drivers, which may induce a crash if they were not aware of road and traffic conditions.
   This research analyses how ready the road horizontal alignment is for existing semi-autonomous systems. A Level 2 vehicle has been tested on many different horizontal curves, finding a strong relationship between the maximum speed that the autonomous system can attain and the curve geometry. This maximum speed is proposed as a new concept (automated speed) and has been found to be lower than the design, operating and posted speeds in many cases. Another new concept - automated driving consistency - arises, as the difference between automated and operating speeds. The related inconsistencies can be addressed with the new concept of Level of Service for Automated Driving (LOSAD), which summarizes how ready a corridor is for a certain driving automation system. This parameter should be determined - further certified - for any homogeneous road segment, and later informed to drivers.

AB Parking is a challenging task for autonomous vehicles and requires a centimeter level precision of distance measurement for safe parking at a destination to avoid collisions with nearby vehicles. In order to avoid collisions with parked vehicles while parking, real-time localization performance should be maintained even when loop closing occurs. This study proposes a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) method, using around view monitor (AVM)/light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor fusion, that provides rapid loop closing performance. We extract the parking line features by utilizing the sensor fusion data for sparse feature-based pose graph optimization that boosts the loop closing speed. Hence, the proposed method can perform the loop closing within a few milliseconds to compensate for the accumulative errors even in a large-scale outdoor environment, which is much faster than other LiDAR-based SLAM algorithms. Therefore, it easily satisfies real-time localization performance. Furthermore, thanks to the parking line features, the proposed method can detect a parking space by utilizing the accumulated parking lines in the map. The experiment was performed in three outdoor parking lots to validate the localization performance and parking space detection performance. All of the proposed methods can be operated in real-time in a single-CPU environment.

AB To extend the mission duration of smaller unmanned aerial vehicles, this letter presents a solar recharge approach that uses lakes as landing, charging, and standby areas. The Sherbrooke University Water-Air VEhicle (SUWAVE) is a small aircraft capable of vertical takeoff and landing on water. A second-generation prototype has been developed with new capabilities: solar recharging, autonomous flight, and a larger takeoff envelope using an actuated takeoff strategy. A 3D dynamic model of the new takeoff maneuver is conceived to understand the major forces present during this critical phase. Numerical simulations are validated with experimental results from real takeoffs made in the laboratory and on lakes. The final prototype is shown to have accomplished repeated cycles of autonomous takeoff, followed by assisted flight and landing, without any human physical intervention between cycles.

AB Robust road-boundary extraction/tracking is one of the main problems in autonomous roadway navigation. Although the road boundary can be defined by various means including lane markings, curbs, and borders of vegetation, this paper focuses on road-boundary tracking using curbs. A vehicle-mounted (downward tilted) 2-D laser-measurement system is utilized to detect the curbs. The tracking problem is difficult because both the vehicle is moving and the target is disappearing, reappearing, and maneuvering in clutter. The interacting-multiple-model probabilistic-data-association filter (IMMPDAF) is proposed to solve the problems after detailed analysis. Track initiation, confirmation, and deletion are performed using the sequential-probability-ratio test. Extensive simulations followed by experiments in a campus environment show that the road-boundary tracking utilizing curbs is possible and robust through IMMPDAF.

AB Automated Vehicles (AVs) reform the automotive industry by enabling real-time and efficient data exchange between the vehicles. While connectivity and automation of the vehicles deliver a slew of benefits, they may also introduce new safety, security, and privacy risks. Further, AVs rely entirely on the sensor data and the data from other vehicles too. On the other hand, the sensor data is susceptible to anomalies caused by cyber-attacks, errors, and faults, resulting in accidents and fatalities. Hence, it is essential to create techniques for detecting anomalies and identifying their sources before the wide adoption of AVs. This paper proposes an anomaly detection model using a Modified-Convolutional Neural Network (M-CNN) with Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) dataset. The M-CNN model comprises specifically trained layers involving the ReLU activation function for feature extraction and detection of AV anomalies. Furthermore, the Adam is used as the optimization algorithm to train the model. The detection accuracy of the proposed model is compared with Isolation Forest (IF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The experimental result reveals that the proposed model outperforms the other models with an accuracy of 99.40% in AV anomaly detection.

AB Safety and stability have been two main considerations in the field of collision avoidance. However, if the response of a vehicle to avoid collision does not conform to the habits of a human driver, it can cause tension and discomfort to the driver, or even worse, misunderstanding between the driver and an automatic driving system can occur, leading to a traffic accident. Therefore, a driver's reaction characteristics should be considered, and the reaction expected by the driver should be satisfied as much as possible. This study proposes a human-like collision avoidance model based on a neural network under emergency conditions. The vehicle response data collected from experienced drivers in the collision-avoidance stage via driving simulators are used to train the neural network model. A front-wheel angle controller is developed to track the output of the human-like neural network model. Moreover, the stability region of a vehicle is obtained by the K-means method. Further, a differential braking controller is designed to ensure the safety and stability of the vehicle. The simulation results show that the proposed human-like collision avoidance controller not only meets the safety and stability requirements of collision avoidance but can also ensure good driving comfort for human drivers.

AB Lately, Autonomous vehicles (AV) have been gaining traction globally owing to their huge social, economic and environmental benefits. However, the rising safety apprehensions for vulnerable road users (VRU) alongside have become a stumbling block to the large-scale implementation of AVs. Deciphering intention in advance considering all social norms and context surrounding the VRU is a highly challenging task due to the huge amount of variability in their motion, actions and end goals. Based on this pensiveness, this paper extensively surveys the variety of techniques applied to anticipate pedestrian intention and classifies them from multiple perspectives. Some newly introduced datasets with added complexities of human behaviour on road have also been outlined. It also provides a comparative analysis of the performance of pedestrian intention prediction approaches on several benchmark datasets as per the various assessment parameters available. In addition to this, several potential challenges and their possible solutions paving way for future research initiatives have also been thoroughly analysed in this endeavour. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB Autonomous driving is evolving through the convergence of object recognition using multiple sensors in the fourth industrial revolution. In this paper, we propose a system that utilizes data logging to control the functions of micro e-mobility vehicles (MEVs) and to build a database for autonomous driving with a gesture recognition algorithm for use in an IoT environment. The proposed system uses multiple sensors installed in an MEV to log driving data as the vehicle operates and to recognize objects surrounding the MEV to remove blind spots. In addition, the proposed system is capable of multi-sensor control and data logging for the MEV based on a gesture recognition algorithm, and it can provide safety information to allow the system to address blind spots or unexpected situations by recognizing the appearances or gestures of pedestrians around the MEV. The proposed system can be applied and extended in various fields, such as 5G communication, autonomous driving, and AI, which are the core technologies of the fourth industrial revolution.

AB In the field of underwater image recognition, a chip with smaller footprint and lower energy consumption is required to be implanted into autonomous intelligent underwater vehicle to make real-time response to the surrounding objects. Therefore, a promising accelerator with high performance and low energy consumption is designed, which optimizes the features possessed by convolutional neural network. The sharing of weights between neurons reduces the memory requirement. With all convolutional neural network data stored within on-chip static random-access memory, the need for memory access is drastically decreased. Besides, several small processing elements are used to form neural functional unit, which considerably reduces the bandwidth requirement through inter-processing element data transmission. By sending control signals to autonomous underwater vehicle, this accelerator enables it to avoid dangerous areas such as rocks and algae in time. The result suggests the proposed accelerator successfully achieves a higher processing speed than that of CPU and GPU with a footprint of 6.09 mm(2)only and the energy consumption of 327.3 mW at 1 GHz.

AB Rapid advances in technologies have accelerated the timeline for public use of fully-automated and communications-connected vehicles. Public opinion on self-driving vehicles or AVs is evolving rapidly, and many behavioral questions have not yet been addressed. This study emphasizes AV mode choices, including Americans' willingness to pay (WTP) to ride with a stranger in a shared AV fleet vehicle on various trip types and the long-distance travel impacts of AVs. Exactly 2,588 complete responses to a stated-preference survey with 70 questions provide valuable insights on privacy concerns, safety and dynamic ride-sharing with strangers, long-distance travel and preferences for smarter vehicles and transport systems. Two hurdle models (which allow for a high share of zero-value responses) were estimated: one to predict WTP to share a ride and another to determine WTP to anonymize location while using AVs, and a multinomial logit was developed to estimate long-distance mode choices with AVs and SAVs available. Results suggest that WTP to share rides will rise over time, for a variety of reasons, and SAV use will be particularly popular for long-distance business travel. Elasticity estimates suggest that privacy may not be an important concern for AV-based travel.

AB Autonomous driving at at-limit handling represents a big challenge due to the nonlinear behaviour of a vehicle. In this paper, a hierarchical control scheme composed of two Nonlinear Model Predictive Controls (NMPCs) for path following is proposed. This structure allows for real-time feasibility without having to simplify excessively the vehicle model. The higher level NMPC operates on a long prediction horizon with a point-mass model which constraints are given by a tyre dependant 'g-g diagram'. The output of the higher level is a velocity profile which is used as terminal constraint by the lower level NMPC. This operates on a short horizon and is based on a seven degrees of freedom vehicle model with full Pacejka Magic Formula tyre formulation on all tyres, load transfers and Limited Slip Differential. Because of the terminal set computed by the higher level, it is possible to use a short horizon and exploit the vehicle performance in real-time. For both controllers, the full Nonlinear Optimisation Problem is solved at each step. The algorithm is tested in a Model-in-the-Loop environment where a validated Vi-Grade vehicle model is controlled in co-simulation. The results show the effectiveness and feasibility of real-time control with complex vehicle models.

AB There is a critical need to quantify and monitor mesophotic coral reef community structure and function at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Because accessing these habitats is costly in terms of infrastructure and effort, often for a modest return in data, many investigators collect digital imagery using transect techniques from unmanned platforms. Specifically, remotely operated vehicles and autonomous underwater vehicles are used because they operate at deeper depths for extensive periods of time, can carry an array of oceanographic and imaging instruments, and can collect and archive extensive amounts of video and still imagery. However, substrate angle, camera angle, and vehicle position above the benthos creates varying degrees of error in the imagery due to parallax and geometric distortion. Photogrammetry conducted on 2D photographs from uncorrected 3D imagery can over- or under-estimate the percent cover, biomass estimates, and abundance of the benthic groups of interest. Here we illustrate these errors and emphasize the requirement for post-processing of imagery to ensure that these data can be used for valid quantitative ecological descriptions of mesophotic benthic communities in the future.

AB This paper presents a real-time vehicle speed planning system called the real-time energy-optimal deceleration planning system (RT-EDPS). Connectivity and autonomous driving technologies that provide map and navigation data, traffic light information, and front detection sensor data are exploited to perceive and forecast upcoming deceleration events. A parameterized polynomial-based deceleration model is employed as the deceleration strategy. Real driving test data that characterize the physical limits of regenerative braking are used to model the objective function and constraints of the parameterized deceleration commands. The proposed RT-EDPS involves two speed-planning strategies with different scales of the planning horizon. Within a deceleration event horizon ascertained by the signal phase and timing data of traffic signals and 3D geographic map data, a dynamic programming-based energy-efficient deceleration strategy is used to generate long-sighted speed profiles. While the scheduled vehicle speed is being tracked, if a preceding vehicle is detected within a predefined threshold range, then a model predictive control-based energy-efficient deceleration strategy that incorporates the traffic status ahead of the ego vehicle and exploits V2V communication with the preceding vehicles is activated to re-plan the speed trajectory of the vehicle to guarantee a collision-free distance for the preceding vehicle. In virtual driving experiments, we record energy-recuperation efficiency gains of over 40% as compared to human drivers.

AB Intersections are a major source of traffic delays and accidents within modern transportation systems. Compared to signalized intersection management, autonomous intersection management (AIM) coordinates the intersection crossing at an individual vehicle level, which provides additional flexibility. AIM can potentially eliminate stopping in intersection crossings due to traffic lights while maintaining a safe separation among conflicting movements. In this article, the state-of-the-art AIM research among various disciplines (e.g., traffic engineering and control engineering) is surveyed from the perspective of three hierarchical layers: corridor coordination layer, intersection management layer, and vehicle control layer. The key aspects of AIM designs are discussed in detail, including conflict detection schemes, priority rules, control centralization, computation complexity, and so on. Potential improvements for AIM evaluation with the emphasis on realistic scenarios are provided. This article serves as a comprehensive review of AIM design and provides promising directions for future research.

AB This paper describes a customized thruster for Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASV). The thruster is a Pump-Jet Module (PJM), which has been expressly designed, modeled, constructed, and tested for small-/medium-sized ASVs that perform environmental monitoring in extremely shallow waters such as wetlands (rivers, lakes, swamps, marshes), where water depth is only a few centimeters. The PJM is a fully-electric propulsion unit with a 360-degree continuous steering capability. Its main advantage is that the unit is flush with the flat bottom of the vehicle. This makes the PJM suitable for operation in extremely shallow waters because the risk of damaging the thrusting unit in case of grounding is very limited. The PJM was produced using innovative materials, and the hydraulic components were all constructed using a 3D printer.

AB The problem of the underactuated Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) area-keeping control under unknown slow time-varying external environment disturbances and input time-delay, an integral timedelay sliding mode control algorithm based on weather optimal intermittent strategy is proposed in this article. Firstly, integral time-delay sliding mode control law is constructed, with controller parameters chosen according to the upper bound of time-delay. In the control law, a geometric updating rule is designed for the virtual suspension point, which enables ASV at a particular small area with a weather optimal heading. And, weather optimal intermittent strategy is developed to extend the area-keeping control method, while reducing ASV energy consumption. Besides, the closed-loop system is globally asymptotically stable through Lyapunov-Krasovskii analysis. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is illustrated through the simulation examples. (c) 2022 Society of Naval Architects of Korea. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

ID SYSTEMS
AB This paper proposes a novel framework for addressing the challenge of autonomous overtaking and obstacle avoidance, which incorporates the overtaking path planning into Gaussian Process-based model predictive control (GPMPC). Compared with conventional control strategies, this approach has two main advantages. Firstly, combining Gaussian Process (GP) regression with a nominal model allows for learning from model mismatch and unmodeled dynamics, which enhances a simple model and delivers significantly better results. Due to the approximation for propagating uncertainties, we can furthermore satisfy the constraints and thereby the safety of the vehicle is ensured. Secondly, we convert the geometric relationship between the ego vehicle and other obstacle vehicles into the constraints. Without relying on a higher-level path planner, this approach substantially reduces the computational burden. In addition, we transform the state constraints under the model predictive control (MPC) framework into a soft constraint and incorporate it as relaxed barrier function into the cost function, which makes the optimizer more efficient. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method can not only fulfill the overtaking tasks but also maintain safety at all times.

AB This paper presents a design method for target enclosing of an underactuated autonomous surface vehicle to surround a maneuvering target with time-varying velocity, and both the target and the follower suffer from unknown ocean currents. Specifically, a target-enclosing controller is developed based on a line-of-sight (LOS) guidance and an ocean current estimator, where only the yaw rate is used to stabilize the circular motion around the target. Then, the proposed strategy is extended to the case where the target velocity is unavailable and the ocean currents time-varying. By using the relative range and angle information, an extended state observer is developed to estimate unknown relative velocities together with the ocean currents in real-time. Based on the estimated relative dynamics, a LOS, target-enclosing controller is developed without any velocity information of the target. The stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed via the Lyapunov theory. Both simulations and experiments are conducted to show the performance of the proposed LOS, target-enclosing controller for surrounding a maneuvering target.

AB This paper presents a novel leader-follower formation control for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). The dynamic model of ASV and the traditional methods of trajectory tracking are analyzed. Previous research about ASVs' formation focuses on the way of realizing trajectory tracking under conditions, such as time-delays, finite-time, and non-holonomic system. However, principles of constructing a suitable ASVs formation are often neglected. We present a novel leader-follower relation-invariable persistent formation (RIPF) control for ASVs, from which a persistent formation can be generated in any position. Obtained by using RIPF control potential function, the outputs of RIPF control are data points, which should be smoothened using broad learning system (BLS). The global leader navigates the mission trajectory, and each follower follows the RIPF trajectory to satisfy the RIPF potential function. The neural network-based adaptive dynamic surface control is introduced to solve the mission trajectory tracking problems. Environmental disturbances exist in ASV model, and BLS also can be used to approximate the disturbances. The simulation results show that the proposed generative method and control law are effective to realize the desired formation.

AB A smart city provides its people with high standard of living through advanced technologies, and transport is one of the major foci. With the advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs), an AV-based public transportation system has been proposed recently, which is capable of providing new forms of transportation services with high efficiency, high flexibility, and low cost. For the benefit of passengers, multi-tenancy can increase market competition leading to lower service charge and higher quality of service. In this paper, we study the pricing issue of themulti-tenant AV public transportation system and three types of services are defined. The pricing process for each service type is modeled as a combinatorial auction, in which the service providers, as bidders, compete for offering transportation services. The winners of the auction are determined through an integer linear program. To prevent the bidders from raising their bids for higher returns, we propose a strategy-proof Vickrey-Clarke-Groves-based charging mechanism, which can maximize the social welfare, to settle the final charges for the customers. We perform extensive simulations to verify the analytical results and evaluate the performance of the charging mechanism.

AB The control of complex nonlinear systems (such as autonomous vehicles) usually requires models which might be unavailable or inaccurate. In this paper, a novel data-driven Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework is proposed based on a data-driven approach to learn Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy models for nonlinear systems. To address the data TS modeling, we use the Evolving TS Fuzzy Ellipsoidal Information Granules (TS-EEFIG) approach to obtain a polytopic representation as well as a set of membership functions that allows to use efficient linear control tools to handle complex nonlinear systems. In particular, the formulated approach is applied for the autonomous driving control problem of a racing vehicle. The proposed control uses references provided by an external trajectory planner offering a high driving performance in racing mode. The control-estimation scheme is validated in a simulated racing environment based on a high fidelity vehicle model of a 1/10 scale RC car to show the potential of the proposed approach.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB An improved genetic collision avoidance algorithm is proposed in this study to address the problem that Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASV) need to comply with the collision avoidance rules at sea in congested sea areas. Firstly, a collision risk index model for ASV safe encounters is established taking into account the international rules for collision avoidance. The ASV collision risk index and the distance of safe encounters are taken as boundary values of the correlation membership function of the collision risk index model to calculate the optimal heading of ASV in real-time. Secondly, the genetic coding, fitness function, and basic parameters of the genetic algorithm are designed to construct the collision avoidance decision system. Finally, the simulation of collision avoidance between ASV and several obstacle vessels is performed, including the simulation of three collision avoidance states head-on situation, crossing situation, and overtaking situation. The results show that the proposed intelligent genetic algorithm considering the rules of collision avoidance at sea can effectively avoid multiple other vessels in different situations.

AB The emergence of the shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) provides new opportunities and challenges for the fashionable car-sharing mode. This study proposes a time-dependent SAV system design problem by jointly optimizing fleet size, parking infrastructure deployment, and daily operation of the system for infrastructure planning in the long run. The dynamic system optimum (DSO) principle in terms of total daily system cost (TDSC) is adopted to formulate the daily operation of the SAV system, i.e., users' departure time choices and SAVs' route choices. By incorporating the link transmission model (LTM) as the traffic flow model, the daily operation problem (DOP) of the SAV system is formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem. Further, the time-dependent SAV system design problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The LP relaxation of the proposed MILP problem could provide a tight lower bound, and a diving heuristic algorithm is developed to solve the proposed MILP problem. Finally, numerical examples are designed to illustrate the properties of the model and the efficiency of the proposed solution algorithm.

AB The impacts of autonomous vehicles (AV) are widely anticipated to be socially, economically, and ethically significant. A reliable assessment of the harms and benefits of their large-scale deployment requires a multi-disciplinary approach. To that end, we employed Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis to make such an assessment. We obtained opinions from 19 disciplinary experts to assess the significance of 13 potential harms and eight potential benefits that might arise under four deployments schemes. Specifically, we considered: (1) the status quo, i.e., no AVs are deployed; (2) unfettered assimilation, i.e., no regulatory control would be exercised and commercial entities would "push" the development and deployment; (3) regulated introduction, i.e., regulatory control would be applied and either private individuals or commercial fleet operators could own the AVs; and (4) fleets only, i.e., regulatory control would be applied and only commercial fleet operators could own the AVs. Our results suggest that two of these scenarios, (3) and (4), namely regulated privately-owned introduction or fleet ownership or autonomous vehicles would be less likely to cause harm than either the status quo or the unfettered options.

AB Underwater imaging has been increasingly employed in vision-based marine research. However, the inappropriate installation of a light source and the complex underwater environment will result in the uneven illumination and overexposure on the captured images. To address these issues, an underwater image enhancement framework for autonomous underwater vehicles platform is proposed, which consists of underwater light source optimization and illumination nonuniformity correction. The light source optimization method improves the imaging quality by computing an appropriate angle of the light casting. In this way, the center of the field of view is always well lit. In addition, an adaptive filter-based illumination correction algorithm is proposed to solve the uneven illumination caused by the artificial light source. During this process, image block segmentation and the measure of image enhancement index are applied to improve the adaptability and reduce the calculation errors of the filter parameters. A dataset with real underwater images collected under different natural conditions has been built and tested. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is more adaptive and effective than the typical methods. (C) 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

AB This paper addresses the perception, control, and trajectory planning for an aerial platform to identify and land on a moving car at 15 km/hr. The hexacopter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), equipped with onboard sensors and a computer, detects the car using a monocular camera and predicts the car future movement using a nonlinear motion model. While following the car, the UAV lands on its roof, and it attaches itself using magnetic legs. The proposed system is fully autonomous from takeoff to landing. Numerous field tests were conducted throughout the year-long development and preparations for the Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC) 2017 competition, for which the system was designed. We propose a novel control system in which a model predictive controller is used in real time to generate a reference trajectory for the UAV, which are then tracked by the nonlinear feedback controller. This combination allows to track predictions of the car motion with minimal position error. The evaluation presents three successful autonomous landings during the MBZIRC 2017, where our system achieved the fastest landing among all competing teams.

AB Recently, cyber-physical systems (CPSs) have emerged as a cutting edge technology for next-generation industrial applications, and are undergoing rapid development and inspiring numerous application domains. In this article, we propose a novel CPS application for energy management framework (EMF) toward autonomous electric vehicle (AEV) in smart grid. We first give a brief overview of related technologies, including open research issues of CPS, enabling wireless communication technologies for CPS, smart grid, AEV and its path planning, energy-efficient design for AEV, etc. Then we design EMF from the following aspects, such as AEV with wireless sensor networks (WSNs) navigation, smart grid communication architecture for EMF and AEV charging station. The proposed EMF is able to collect the real-time power consumption status and demand from AEV and charging stations. We also address EMF to overcome some issues, such as real-time traffic information. Subsequently, the energy-efficient design schemes for AEV are proposed and formulated from the point of view of path planning and event-based control technique. Finally, we outline the issues and challenges for EMF.

   desired error dynamics; time delay estimation
ID SLIDING MODE CONTROL; AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES
AB In this paper, we propose a trajectory tracking controller with experimental verification for torpedo-like autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with underactuation characteristics. The proposed controller overcomes the underactuation problem by designing the desired error dynamics in a coupled form using state variables in body-fixed and world coordinates. Unlike the back-stepping control requiring high-order derivatives of state variables, the proposed controller only requires the first derivatives of the states, which can alleviate noise magnification issues due to differentiation. We adopt time delay estimation to estimate the dynamics indirectly using control inputs and vehicle outputs, making the proposed controller relatively easy to apply without requiring the all of the vehicle dynamics. We also address some practical issues that commonly arise in experimental environments: handling measurement noises and actuation limits. To mitigate the effects of noise on the controller, a filtering technique using a moving window average is employed. Additionally, to account for the actuation limits, we design an anti-windup structure that takes into consideration the nonlinearity between the thrusting force and rotating speed of the thruster. We verify the tracking performance of the proposed controller through experimentation using an AUV. The experimental results show that the 3D motion control of the proposed controller exhibits an RMS error of 0.3216 m and demonstrate that the proposed controller achieves accurate tracking performance, making it suitable for survey missions that require tracking errors of less than one meter.

AB Self-driving vehicles are expected to bring many benefits among which are enhancing traffic efficiency and reliability, and reducing fuel consumption which would have a great economic and environmental impact. The success of this technology heavily relies on the full situational awareness of its surrounding entities. This is achievable only when everything is networked, including vehicles, users and infrastructure, and exchange the sensed data among the nearby objects to increase their awareness. Nevertheless, human intervention is still needed in the loop anyway to deal with unseen situations or compensate for inaccurate or improper vehicle's decisions. For such cases, video feed, in addition to other data such as LiDAR, is considered essential to provide humans with the real picture of what is happening to eventually take the right decision. However, if the video is not delivered in a timely fashion, it becomes useless or likely produces catastrophic outcomes. Additionally, any disruption in the streamed video, for instance during handover operation while traversing inter-countries cross borders, is very annoying to the user and possibly cause damage as well. in this article, we start by describing two important use cases, namely Remote Driving and Platooning, where the timely delivery of video is of extreme importance [1]. Thereafter, we detail our implemented solution to accommodate the aforementioned use cases for self-driving vehicles. Through extensive experiments in local and LTE networks, we show that our solution ensures a very low endto- end latency. Also, we show that our solution keeps the video outage as low as possible during handover operation.

AB Autonomous vehicles need to have the ability to predict the motion of surrounding vehicles, which will help to avoid potential accidents and make the best decision to ensure safety and comfort. The interactions among vehicles and those between them and the uncertainty of driving intention make trajectory prediction a challenging task. This study presents a long short-term memory (LSTM) model for the task of trajectory prediction to account for both the mutual information and the multi-modal intention. The model consists of a data fusion encoder and a multi-modal decoder. The data fusion encoder summarises the mutual information by multi-LSTM with shared parameters and the multi-modal decoder generates trajectories based on driving intention. In addition, mixture density network is added to output a probabilistic prediction which improves the reliability of prediction results. NGSIM data set is used for training and testing. The results show that the proposed model can better capture the interactive driving behaviour and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in root-weighted square error of displacement and velocity.

AB A critical challenge for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is the docking operation for applications such as sleeping under the mother ship, recharging batteries, transferring data, and new mission downloading. The final stage of docking at a unidirectional docking station requires the AUV to approach while keeping the pose (position and orientation) of the vehicle within an allowable range. The appropriate pose therefore demands a sensor unit and a control system that have high accuracy and robustness against disturbances existing in a real-world underwater environment. This paper presents a vision-based AUV docking system consisting of a 3D model-based matching method and Real-time Multi-step Genetic Algorithm (GA) for real-time estimation of the robot's relative pose. Experiments using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) with dual-eye cameras and a separate 3D marker were conducted in a small indoor pool. The experimental results confirmed that the proposed system is able to provide high homing accuracy and robustness against disturbances that influence not only the captured camera images but also the movement of the vehicle. A successful docking operation using stereo vision that is new and novel to the underwater vehicle environment was achieved and thus proved the effectiveness of the proposed system for AUV.

AB Modeling and control of dynamic systems that experience abrupt changes are challenging and fundamental tasks in applications of different areas of engineering. Among these, control synthesis for autonomous heavy-duty vehicles has the potential to highly benefit transportation systems. That said, we propose a robust recursive regulator for discrete-time Markov jump linear systems with polytopic uncertain data. We assume the uncertainties affect the state-space parameters as well as the transition probability matrix. We formulate an optimization problem using the penalty function method and design a recursive solution, whereby we attain the robust state feedback gains. We impose no restrictions on how fast the uncertainties can change between two consecutive iterations. Conditions for convergence and mean-square stability are well defined in terms of Riccati recursive equations. We also set up a procedure for powertrain polytopic model identification based on CAN bus data of an autonomous heavy-duty ground vehicle. We provide two numerical examples to verify the effectiveness of the robust recursive regulator. Moreover, in a third example, we validate the obtained powertrain model on a trajectory tracking problem and compute acceleration and braking inputs using the robust regulator.

TI Modelling Ethical Algorithms in Autonomous Vehicles Using Crash Data

LA English
DT Article
DE Autonomous vehicles; ethics; crash data; safety
ID TROLLEY; DILEMMA
AB In this paper we provide a proof of principle of a new method for addressing the ethics of autonomous vehicles (AVs), the Data-Theories Method, in which vehicle crash data is combined with philosophical ethical theory to provide a guide to action for AV algorithm design. We use this method to model three scenarios in which an AV is exposed to risk on the road, and determine possible actions for the AV. We then examine how different philosophical perspectives on agent partiality, or the degree to which one can act in one's own self-interest, might address each scenario. This method shows why modelling the ethics of AVs using data is essential. First, AVs may sometimes have options that human drivers do not, and designing AVs to mimic the most ethical human driver would not ensure that they do the right thing. Second, while ethical theories can often disagree about what should he done, disagreement can be reduced and compromises found with a more complete understanding of the AV's choices and their consequences. Finally, framing problems around thought experiments may elicit preferences that are divergent with what individuals might prefer once they are provided with information about the real risks for a scenario. Our method provides a principled and empirical approach to productively address these problems and offers guidance on AV algorithm design.

DE Autonomous guided vehicles (AGV); Lane detection; Vector fuzzy

ID TRACKING; SYSTEM
AB In most actual autonomous guided vehicles (AGV), path finding and navigational control systems are usually implemented using images captured by cameras mounted on the vehicles. This paper presents and discusses a lane boundary detection technique that is necessary for the task of autonomous driving. In this paper, a new method called vector fuzzy connectedness (VFC) is presented to detect and estimate road lane boundaries. First, a preprocessed technique is used to obtain a skeleton image. Based on the result, the curvatures of the left and right lane boundaries are estimated, and the control points are found by the VFC method. Finally, the non-uniform b-spline (NUBS) interpolation method is introduced to construct the road lane boundaries. The proposed VFC method integrates the vector concept and fuzzy connectedness into the lane boundary detection algorithm. As shown in the example results, the proposed method can extract various road lane shapes and types from real road frames even under complex road environments. For navigation tasks, it is necessary to determine the position of the vehicle relative to the road. These results prove that the proposed detection method can assist in a number of actual AGV assistant applications. In the future, some intelligent techniques will be applied to test the AGV system with obstacle avoidance conditions on real world roads.

AB Next-generation vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks are envisioned as communication platforms, which not only aim to improve road safety and drastically increase traffic efficiency but also introduce a plethora of innovative applications that mostly require ultrareliable low-latency communications. Motivated by such new applications and its accompanying services, future vehicular networks can easily switch from current connected vehicles, mostly vehicle-to-vehicle, to fully heterogeneous V2X networks that support autonomous driving. Toward this target, the deep integration between artificial intelligence (AI) and fog computing (FC) technologies within the future V2X networks is a step whose time has come. In this survey, we address a novel and practical AI-enabled vehicular network architecture with FC in its core. Moreover, we present AI-enabled, fog-assisted V2X use cases that accommodate important FC capabilities and exploit the power of AI for enabling the desired evolution of vehicular networks. Finally, some potential issues of AI in FC-based V2X networks for future work are discussed.

AB To understand the dynamics of an autonomous ridesharing transport mode from the perspectives of different stakeholders, a single model of such a system is essential, because this will enable policymakers and companies involved in the manufacture and operation of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) to develop user-centered strategies. The model needs to be based on real data, network, and traffic information and applied to real cities and situations, particularly those with complex public transportation systems. In this paper, we propose a new agent-based model for SAV deployment that enables the parametric assessment of key performance indicators from the perspective of potential SAV users, vehicle manufacturers, operators, and local authorities. This has been applied to a case study of three regions in London: central, inner, and outer. The results show there is no linear correlation between an increased ridesharing acceptance level and average trip duration. Without a fleet rebalancing algorithm, over 80% of SAVs' energy expenditure is on picking up customers. By reducing pickup distance, SAVs could be a contender for a nonpersonal transportation system based on trip energy comparisons. The results provide a picture of future SAV systems for potential users and offer suggestions as to how operators can devise an optimal transportation strategy beyond the question of fleet size and how policymakers can improve the overall transport network and reduce its environmental impact based on energy consumption. As a result of its flexibility and parametric capability, the model can be utilized to inform any local authority how SAV services could be deployed in any city.

ID CONTROLLER; DECISION
AB This paper proposes an autonomous obstacle avoidance method combining improved A-star (A*) and improved artificial potential field (APF) to solve the planning and tracking problems of autonomous vehicles in a road environment. The A*APF algorithm performs path planning tasks, and based on the longitudinal braking distance model, a dynamically changing obstacle influence range is designed. When there is no obstacle affecting the controlled vehicle, the improved A* algorithm with angle constraint combined with steering cost can quickly generate the optimal route and reduce turning points. If the controlled vehicle enters the influence domain of the obstacle, the improved artificial potential field algorithm will generate lane-changing paths and optimize the local optimal locations based on simulated annealing. Pondering the influence of surrounding participants, the four-mode obstacle avoidance process is established, and the corresponding safe distance condition is analyzed. A particular index is introduced to comprehensively evaluate speed, risk warning, and safe distance factors, so the proposed method is designed based on the fuzzy control theory. In the tracking task, a model predictive controller in the light of the kinematics model is devised to make the longitudinal and lateral process of lane-changing meet comfort requirements, generating a feasible autonomous lane-change path. Finally, the simulation was performed in the Matlab/Simulink and Carsim combined environment. The proposed fusion path generation algorithm can overcome the shortcomings of the traditional single method and better adapt to the dynamic environment. The feasibility of the obstacle avoidance algorithm is verified in the three-lane simulation scenario to meet safety and comfort requirements.

AB Image classification is a core field in the research area of image processing and computer vision in which vehicle classification is a critical domain. The purpose of vehicle categorization is to formulate a compact system to assist in real-world problems and applications such as security, traffic analysis, and self driving and autonomous vehicles. The recent revolution in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence has provided an immense amount of support for image processing related problems and has overtaken the conventional, and handcrafted means of solving image analysis problems. In this paper, a combination of pre-trained CNN GoogleNet and a nature-inspired problem optimization scheme, particle swarm optimization (PSO), was employed for autonomous vehicle classification. The model was trained on a vehicle image dataset obtained from Kaggle that has been suitably augmented. The trained model was classified using several classifiers; however, the Cubic SVM (CSVM) classifier was found to outperform the others in both time consumption and accuracy (94.8%). The results obtained from empirical evaluations and statistical tests reveal that the model itself has shown to outperform the other related models not only in terms of accuracy (94.8%) but also in terms of training time (82.7 s) and speed prediction (380 obs/sec).

DE Autonomous vehicles; Visual odometry; Kalman filter
AB Autonomous vehicles rely on the accurate estimation of their pose, speed and direction of travel to perform basic navigation tasks. Although GPSs are very useful, they have some drawbacks in urban applications that affect their accuracy. Visual odometry is an alternative or complementary method because provides the ego motion of the vehicle with enough accuracy and uses a sensor already available in some vehicles for other tasks, so no extra sensor is needed. In this paper, a new method is proposed that detects and tracks features available on the surface of the ground, due to the texture of the road or street and road markings. This way it is assured only static points are taken into account in order to obtain the relative movement between images. A Kalman filter improves the estimations and the Ackermann steering restriction is applied so the vehicle follows a constrained trajectory, which improves the camera displacement estimation obtained from a PnP algorithm. Some results and comparisons in real urban environments are shown in order to demonstrate the good performance of the algorithm. They show the method is able to estimate the linear and angular speeds of the vehicle with high accuracy as well as its ability to follow the real trajectory drove by the vehicle along long paths within a minimum error.

AB This research investigates a computational method, which can assist the development of occupants' passive safety in future autonomous vehicles, more particularly in the definition of head kinematics in rotated seat arrangement during emergency braking. To capture these head motions, the methodology utilised an Active Human Model, whose head kinematics were validated in a previous work in three-point and lap-belt restraint configuration scenarios. A sled model was then built where the seat backrest angle (SBA) and the seat orientation, modelled by rotating the acceleration angle (AA), could be adjusted to represent various 'living room' seating conditions. A Design of Experiments study was then performed by varying AA from 0 degrees to 360 degrees in steps of 22.5 degrees and SBA from 20 degrees to 60 degrees in steps of 8 degrees. The responses were subsequently converted into a Reduced Order Model (ROM), which was then successfully validated through a comparison with the kinematic responses predicted with simulations. In terms of simulation time, it was found that the ROM was able to calculate the head kinematics in 3 s instead of the 1.5 h taken using Simcenter Madymo, without compromising predicted responses accuracy. This research has provided a unique method to define head kinematics corridors for seated occupants in autonomous vehicle interiors, including maximum head excursion, head kinematics as a function of time and define for the first time (a) the safe "or' but not both head envelope within the cabin interior, and (b) capture the seated scenarios where head proximity to airbag systems could be of concern, following emergency braking.

This work takes place in the framework of the EU FP7-funded ARROWS project. ARROWS adapts and develops low-cost autonomous underwater vehicle technologies to significantly reduce the costs of underwater archaeological operations, covering the full extent of archaeological campaigns. The project deals with underwater mapping, diagnosis and cleaning tasks. During the first half of the project, a cleaning tool prototype, able to be mounted on underwater vehicles, has been worked out: this cleaning tool will be exploited not only during research missions but also for the periodic monitoring, controlling and maintenance activities of well-known underwater archaeological sites (e.g. periodic cleaning operations).

AB This paper studies the design and application of the neural network based adaptive control scheme for autonomous underwater vehicle's (AUV's) depth control system that is an uncertain nonlinear dynamical one with unknown nonlinearities. The unknown nonlinearity is approximated by a feedforward neural network whose parameters are adaptively adjusted on-line according to a set of parameter estimation laws for the purpose of driving the AUV to cruise at the preset depth. The Lyapunov synthesis approach is used to develop the adaptive control scheme. The overall control system can guarantee that the tracking error converges in the small neighborhood of zero and all adjustable parameters involved are uniformly bounded. Simulation examples are given to illustrate the design procedure and the applicability of the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed method is suitable for practical applications.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE
AB This paper investigates fault feature extraction for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with weak thruster fault. When the conventional feature extraction method based on time-frequency domain decomposition is used to extract the weak fault feature of the thruster, the frequency bands of the fault feature and disturbance feature are overlapped, such that it is difficult to extract the fault feature accurately. To solve this problem, a novel extraction method for fault feature is developed based on an optimized sparse decomposition algorithm.
   Two problems are encountered when directly using the existing sparse decomposition algorithm to diagnose weak thruster fault. The first problem is that during the decomposition of time-domain signals, the accuracy is relatively low. A time-shift operator-based decomposition algorithm is proposed in this study to address this problem. The second problem is that during the extraction of weak fault feature of the thruster, the difference between the fault feature and disturbance feature is small. To address this problem, a feature extraction method based on fault weight matrix is proposed. Finally, pool-experimental verifications are presented.

AB In this brief, the leader-follower formation control of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles subject to uncertain dynamics and ocean disturbances is addressed. A robust sliding mode formation control strategy is presented by utilizing backstepping method, adaptive neural network and dynamic surface control technique. The stability of the formation control system is proved based on the Lyapunov's direct method where all the signals are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded. The main advantages of this control strategy are summarized as: (i) the presented controller only depends on the position measurements of the leader, which is more convenient to implement in practice. (ii) the proposed controller does not require any prior knowledge about the hydrodynamic damping and disturbances from the environment. (iii) a continuous PI function is designed to avoid the effect of inherent chattering in standard sliding mode control. (iv) the computational explosion of the standard backstepping method is avoided by the command filter based on the dynamic surface control technique. At last, the comparative simulations are provided to verify the effectiveness of the presented control strategy.

AB This paper addresses the trajectory tracking control problem of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) subject to unknown ocean currents, where smooth and continuous velocity commands are desirable for safe and effective operation. A novel bioinspired approach is proposed by integrating three neural dynamics models into the conventional Lyapunov synthesis. The tracking controller is derived from the error dynamics analysis of the ASV and the stability analysis of the control system. A simple observer is proposed to estimate the unknown ocean currents, which only requires the position of the ASV. The overall control system under the controller and observer is rigorously proved to be asymptotically stable by a Lyapunov stability theory for cascaded systems. The most contribution is that the proposed tracking controller is capable of eliminating the sharp velocity jumps due to sudden tracking error changes and generating smooth and continuous control signals. In addition, it can deals with the situation with unknown ocean currents. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach are demonstrated through simulation and comparison studies.

AB In the real-time decision-making and local planning process of autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments, the autonomous driving system may fail to find a reasonable policy or even gets trapped in some situation due to the complexity of global tasks and the incompatibility between upper level maneuver decisions with the lower level trajectory planning. To solve this problem, this paper presents a synchronous maneuver searching and trajectory planning (SMSTP) algorithm based on the topological concept of homotopy. Firstly, a set of alternative maneuvers with boundary limits are enumerated on a multi-lane road. Instead of sampling numerous paths in the whole spatio-temporal space, we, for the first time, propose using Trajectory Profiles (TPs) to quickly construct the topological maneuvers represented by different routes, and put forward a corridor generation algorithm based on graph-search. The bounded corridor further constrains the maneuver's space in the spatial space. A step-wise heuristic optimization algorithm is then proposed to synchronously generate a feasible trajectory for each maneuver. To achieve real-time performance, we initialize the states to be optimized with the boundary constraints of maneuvers, and we set some heuristic states as terminal targets in the quadratic cost function. The solution of a feasible trajectory is always guaranteed only if a specific maneuver is given. The simulation and realistic driving-test experiments verified that the proposed SMSTP algorithm has a short computation time which is less than 37 ms, and the experimental results showed the validity and effectiveness of the SMSTP algorithm.

AB Sixth-generation networks and vehicular Ad hoc networks advancement brought us to the cusp of a new era. Autonomous Vehicles with a plethora of advanced applications require a substantially enhanced vehicle-to-everything communication network. The infrastructure should efficiently support hyper-fast, ultra-reliable, and low-latency massive data exchange. Roadside units were initially exploited as a promising communication solution to overcome this challenge. However, the challenging integration with the infrastructure led to the investigation of additional solutions. Unmanned aerial vehicles are one of the most dominant assistive solutions due to their inherent advantage of mobility. Moreover, air-to-air and ground-to-air networks are more efficient than ground-to-ground. Nevertheless, it is a prerequisite to leverage the potential of unmanned aerial vehicles to attain nationwide Vehicle-to-Everything connectivity. Therefore, we focused our research orientation on developing a strategy to optimize the network's coverage within the intelligent transportation systems framework. In particular, we have deployed an innovative algorithmic technique that constructs Voronoi diagrams using circles. Besides, we applied the poison point process to determine the optimum locations of the transceivers' establishment. Simulation results illustrate full network coverage for the tested area after the required iterations. Also, time complexity evaluation proved the simplicity of the proposed algorithm.

ID ROAD-SIGN DETECTION
AB Forest fires have become increasingly prevalent and devastating in many regions worldwide, posing significant threats to biodiversity, ecosystems, human settlements, and the economy. The United States (USA) and Portugal are two countries that have experienced recurrent forest fires, raising concerns about the role of forest fuel and vegetation accumulation as contributing factors. One preventive measure which can be adopted to minimize the impact of the forest fires is to cut the amount of forest fuel available to burn, using autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) that make use of Artificial intelligence (AI) to detect and classify the forest vegetation to keep and the forest fire fuel to be cut. In this paper, an innovative study of forest vegetation detection and classification using ground vehicles' RGB images is presented to support autonomous forest cleaning operations to prevent fires, using an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV). The presented work compares two recent high-performance Deep Learning methodologies, YOLOv5 and YOLOR, to detect and classify forest vegetation in five classes: grass, live vegetation, cut vegetation, dead vegetation, and tree trunks. For the training of the two models, we used a dataset acquired in a nearby forest. A key challenge for autonomous forest vegetation cleaning is the reliable discrimination of obstacles (e.g., tree trunks or stones) that must be avoided, and objects that need to be identified (e.g., dead/dry vegetation) to enable the intended action of the robot. With the obtained results, it is concluded that YOLOv5 presents an overall better performance. Namely, the object detection architecture is faster to train, faster in inference speed (achieved in real time), has a small trained weight file, and attains higher precision, therefore making it highly suitable for forest vegetation detection.

AB This paper investigates the Electric Autonomous Dial-A-Ride Problem (E-ADARP), which consists in designing a set of minimum-cost routes that accommodates all customer requests for a fleet of Electric Autonomous Vehicles (EAVs). Problem-specific features of the E-ADARP include: (i) the employment of EAVs and a partial recharging policy; (ii) the weighted-sum objective function that minimizes the total travel time and the total excess user ride time. In this work, we propose a Deterministic Annealing (DA) algorithm and provide the first heuristic results for the static E-ADARP. Partial recharging (i) is handled by an exact route evaluation scheme of linear time complexity. To tackle (ii), we propose a new method that allows effective computations of minimum excess user ride time by introducing a fragment-based representation of paths. These two methods compose an exact and efficient optimization of excess user ride time for a generated E-ADARP route. To validate the performance of the DA algorithm, we compare our algorithm results to the best-reported Branch-and-Cut (B&C) algorithm results on existing instances. Our algorithm provides 25 new best solutions and 45 equal solutions on 84 existing instances. To test the algorithm performance on larger-sized instances, we establish new instances with up to 8 vehicles and 96 requests, and we provide 19 new solutions for these instances. Our final investigation extends the state-of-the-art model and explores the effect of allowing multiple visits to recharging stations. This relaxation can efficiently improve the solution's feasibility and quality. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Replacing traffic signals with roadside vehicle-to-infrastructure systems in the era of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is promising. Managing CAVs in a signal-free intersection, known as autonomous intersection management (AIM), controls the driving behavior of each intersection-traverse CAV to maximize the throughput. Although AIM improves the gross throughput, the fairness of each individual vehicle in its right of way is not seriously considered. This study sets up an AIM system in the cyber-physical-social space to trade traverse priorities quantitatively and fairly. To that end, one needs an AIM method that is optimal and stable, otherwise no convincing trades of traverse priorities could be made. This study proposes a near-optimal lane-free AIM method based on numerical optimal control, wherein log-exp functions are deployed to convexify nondifferentiable collision-avoidance constraints. Besides that, a parameterized social force model (SFM) is proposed to provide a tunable initial guess for numerical optimal control. By tuning the urgency weights in SFM, one may get cooperative trajectories in different homotopy classes, which are further utilized to decide the amount of virtual currency to reward those CAVs who tend to share their traverse priorities. The overall method improves the traverse throughput with individual fairness respected. In experiencing this system, passengers learn how to behave with politeness when they drive manually. Experiments show the efficiency and robustness of the AIM method and also show the efficacy of the overall priority-sharing system.

AB Future autonomous vehicles will rely mainly on global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers for positioning services. However, GNSS cannot maintain an accurate, continuous and reliable navigation solution in the presence of jamming. The widespread availability of in-car jammers or personal privacy devices (PPDs) made GNSS receivers an attractive target for signal jamming. Jammers not only jeopardize current positioning and timing services; they can indeed endanger the safety of the evolving intelligent transportation, autonomous road vehicles and critical infrastructure. The disruption of GNSS signal in some applications, especially safety-critical ones can lead to crucial consequences and risks such as loss of time synchronization and potential loss of life, to name a few. Thus, it is essential for future autonomous vehicles and transport service providers to deploy reliable GNSS anti-jamming techniques. This paper introduces a novel anti-jamming technique based on a high-resolution spectral estimation that utilizes fast orthogonal search (FOS) algorithm in which the jamming signal is modeled using a set of candidate functions and then eliminated from the received signal. The performance of the proposed method is assessed using experiments obtained from Spirent(TM) GSS6700 simulation system. The jamming signal is either obtained from a real jammer or simulated using interference signal generator that is connected to Spirent(TM) system. The results showed that the developed anti-jamming algorithm was able to successfully suppress the continuous wave (CW) interference signal, thus, the performance of the acquisition, tracking and navigation modules within a GPS software receiver were all enhanced.

AB Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is the standard solution for solving the localization problem in outdoor environments, but its signal might be lost when driving in dense urban areas or in the presence of heavy vegetation or overhanging canopies. Hence, there is a need for alternative or complementary localization methods for autonomous driving. In recent years, exteroceptive sensors have gained much attention due to significant improvements in accuracy and cost-effectiveness, especially for 3D range sensors. By registering two successive 3D scans, known as scan matching, it is possible to estimate the pose of a vehicle. This work aims to provide in-depth analysis and comparison of the state-of-the-art 3D scan matching approaches as a solution to the localization problem of autonomous vehicles. Eight techniques (deterministic and probabilistic) are investigated: iterative closest point (with three different embodiments), normal distribution transform, coherent point drift, Gaussian mixture model, support vector-parametrized Gaussian mixture and the particle filter implementation. They are demonstrated in long path trials in both urban and agricultural environments and compared in terms of accuracy and consistency. On the one hand, most of the techniques can be successfully used in urban scenarios with the probabilistic approaches that show the best accuracy. On the other hand, agricultural settings have proved to be more challenging with significant errors even in short distance trials due to the presence of featureless natural objects. The results and discussion of this work will provide a guide for selecting the most suitable method and will encourage building of improvements on the identified limitations.

ID ENERGY
AB Buoyancy driven underwater gliders are highly efficient winged underwater vehicles which locomote by modifying their internal shape. The concept, which is already well-proven in Earth's oceans, is also an appealing technology for remote terrain exploration and environmental sampling on worlds with dense atmospheres. Because of their high efficiency and their gentle, vertical take-off and landing capability, buoyancy driven gliders might perform long duration, global mapping tasks as well as light-duty, local sampling tasks. Moreover, a sufficiently strong gradient in the planetary boundary layer may enable the vehicles to perform dynamic soaring, achieving even greater locomotive efficiency. Shape Change Actuated, Low Altitude Robotic Soarers (SCALARS) are an appealing alternative to more conventional vehicle technology for exploring planets with dense atmospheres. SCALARS are buoyancy driven atmospheric gliders with a twin-hulled, inboard wing configuration. The inboard wing generates lift, which propels the vehicle forward. Symmetric changes in mass distribution induce gravitational pitch moments that provide longitudinal control. Asymmetric changes in mass distribution induce twist in the inboard wing that provides directional control. The vehicle is actuated solely by internal shape change; there are no external seals and no exposed moving parts, save for the inflatable buoyancy ballonets. Preliminary sizing analysis and dynamic modeling indicate the viability of using SCALARS to map the surface of Titan and to investigate features of interest.

   High-speed tracked vehicle; Off-road
AB Although accurate trajectory tracking of autonomous vehicles strongly depends on a precise model, it is difficult to establish a precise model for high-speed tracked vehicles under off-road conditions, due to the complicated interactions between the tracks and the terrain. This paper presents a novel trajectory tracking methodology, called kinematics-aware model predictive control (KAMPC), by combining the slip kinematic model with a trajectory tracking control strategy for skid-steered tracked vehicles. For the slip kinematic model, an online identification methodology called six-parameter slip parameter estimation (SSPE) algorithm is proposed based on the instantaneous centers of rotation. For the trajectory tracking control strategy, optimized algorithm model predictive control is used to obtain the optimal control inputs. Finally, our method is validated through extensive experiments based on a distributed electric-drive high-speed tracked vehicle test platform over different types of terrain and varied off-road surface conditions. Experiment results show that the tracked vehicle kinematic characteristics are distinctive in off-road conditions, and the slipping and skidding that occur when turning are critical to this work. Compared with the other three widely used types of methodologies, the present KAMPC approach can reduce the average tracking residuals and has the best statistical performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION
AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) exchange real-time and seamless data between other AVs and the network, thus revolutionizing the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Automated transportation brings numerous benefits to human beings. However, the concerns such as safety, security, and privacy keep rising. In navigation and trajectory planning, the AVs require exchanging sensory information from their own and other AVs. In such cases, when a malicious AV or faulty sensor-equipped AV comes into connectivity, it can have disruptive consequences. This paper proposes a Hybrid Deep Anomaly Detection (HDAD) approach for effective anomaly detection and cyber-attack mitigation in AVs. The Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm in HDAD approach acts over the 6G network to combat new-age cyber-attacks and provide a swift and accurate anomaly detection mechanism. In conjunction with Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MaxEntIRL), the HDAD approach identifies and isolates malicious AVs. It is envisioned that the obtained results prove the effectiveness of HDAD and have an 8.2% higher accuracy rate than the existing systems.

AB It is well known that activities in running water or wind and waves expose the Autonomous Surface Vessels (ASVs) to considerable challenges. Under these conditions, it is essential to develop a robust control system that can meet the requirements and ensure the safe and accurate execution of missions. In this context, this paper presents a new topology for controller design based on a combination of the Successive Loop Closure (SLC) method and optimal control. This topology enables the design of robust autopilots based on the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. The controllers are tuned from the solution of the optimal control problem, which aims to minimize the effects of model uncertainties. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller, a numerical case study of a natural ASV with 3 Degree of Freedom (DoF) is investigated. The results show that the methodology enabled the tuning of a PID controller capable of dealing with different parametric uncertainties, demonstrating robustness and applicability for different prototype scenarios.

AB This work proposes a command filter-based adaptive practical prescribed-time (PPT) asymptotic tracking control scheme for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) under dynamic uncertainties. Considering that the followers have limited communication angles in the leader-follower formation structure, where a novel controller is proposed to ensure communication angles to achieve preassignable precision within a predefined time. First, we present a PPT control for handling the limited communication angles and, thus, they are allowed to be limited, turnable, and controllable. Then, to achieve the asymptotic convergence of output tracking errors, the proposed adaptive controllers can effectively insure the trajectory tracking errors of AUVs asymptotically converge to zero under the influence of dynamic uncertainties. Furthermore, the derived asymptotically tracking command filter technique for AUVs not only deduce an acceleration-free strategy for followers but also achieve the asymptotic convergence of output tracking errors for the command filters themselves. In the end, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated through stability analysis and simulation test.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have broad applications owing to their small size, low weight, strong ability to operate autonomously, and ability to replace humans in dangerous operations. AUV motion control systems can ensure stable operation in complex ocean environments and have attracted significant research attention in marine science and technology. The main difficulties with AUV motion control include the large uncertainties of dynamic and hydrodynamic characteristics and time delay of the signal transmission channel. In this study, we propose a robust fractional-order proportional-integral-derivative (FOPID) controller design for an AUV yaw control system. First, a three-dimensional stability region analysis method is proposed to achieve fractional orders. Unlike other stability region analysis methods, the proposed method is supported by theory instead of observation. Then, the other parameters are optimized according to the robust design specifications with respect to the parameter uncertainties. Therefore, the controlled system can tolerate different parameter uncertainties and fulfill transient performance specifications while maintaining system stability. The simulation results illustrate the superior robustness and transient performance of the proposed control algorithm.

AB Recently released Autonomous Vehicle (AV) trajectory datasets can potentially catalyze research progress on AV-oriented traffic flow analysis. This paper aims to comprehensively and systematically process and assess one of the AV-oriented open datasets, i.e., Waymo Open Dataset, with a focus on car following paired trajectories. First, the original dataset has been processed into a user-friendly format which contains all important information related to the behavior of AV and surrounding objects. Second, the data quality has been assessed in terms of internal consistency, jerk values and trajectory completeness. Results show that the extracted trajectories are all incomplete but generally they have better quality than that of Next Generation Simulation program (NGSIM) dataset. Third, the trajectory data has been further enhanced by using an optimization-based outlier removal method and a wavelet denoising method. Additionally, we have tested the impact of data outliers and noise on IDM calibration, and revealed significant differences in parameter values for desired time gap T and maximum acceleration a.

AB A common problem for machine vision applications is uncontrolled illumination conditions that cause undesired artifacts on sensorial data. For instance, quality inspection using color cameras, while having wide industrial application, requires manual illumination adjustment and is severely affected by external lighting sources and the physical properties of the inspected object. To overcome this problem, we propose an autonomous illumination solution, that adjusts illumination via a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent following a goal-oriented reward that takes into account image entropy and specularity. The system is validated in a challenging vehicle documentation use case where vehicle images are captured under various lighting conditions using a camera and an in-house built illumination system. The DRL agent learns to control illumination levels directly from high-dimensional visual inputs by mapping the interactions from the environment to the reward-driven control actions of the illumination system, targeting an optimal illumination zone even under the appearance of abrupt illumination changes in the environment.

AB This research is concerned with the motion planning problem encountered by underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in a mapless environment. A motion planning system based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed. This system, which directly optimizes the policy, is an end-to-end motion planning system. It uses sensor information as input and continuous surge force and yaw moment as output. It can reach multiple target points in a sequence while simultaneously avoiding obstacles. In addition, this study proposes a reward curriculum training method to solve the problem in which the number of samples required for random exploration increases exponentially with the number of steps needed to obtain a reward. At the same time, the negative impact of intermediate rewards can be avoided. The proposed system demonstrates good planning ability for a mapless environment and excellent ability to migrate to other unknown environments. The system also has resistance to current disturbances. The simulation results show that the proposed mapless motion planning system can guide an underactuated AUV in navigating to its desired targets without colliding with any obstacles.

ID POWERED-DESCENT GUIDANCE; TRAJECTORY OPTIMIZATION; LINE-SEARCH;
   ALGORITHM; CONSTRAINTS
AB Advanced entry guidance systems could potentially enable future vehicles to generate feasible/optimal flight trajectories onboard for the latest mission requirements and track the new trajectories under uncertainties. To this end, an autonomous entry guidance algorithm is proposed for hypersonic vehicles using convex optimization methods. Based on previous sequential convex programming methods for entry trajectory optimization, a different successive procedure is developed for the online generation and tracking of reference trajectories from the current location to a desired target. In each guidance cycle, a new reference trajectory is generated by solving a second-order cone programming problem, and an optimal feedback guidance law is designed using a quadratically constrained quadratic programming method to track this reference trajectory. Because these two problems are convex, they are expected to be solved by state-of-the-art interior-point methods very efficiently. To demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed entry guidance algorithm, an offline convex entry guidance method is also designed for comparison based on a predetermined reference trajectory. Numerical simulations are presented for both offline and online approaches, which show that the proposed autonomous entry guidance algorithm is robust and efficient for potential future onboard guidance applications.

AB This paper reports the results of the sea experiments and the performance verification of a navigation method for wide area surveys of the seafloor using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In the method, AUVs alternately land on the seafloor to act as landmarks for each other, and all AUVs can observe a wide area with accurate positioning relative to the landmark AUV. For self-localization, AUVs are typically supported by long base line (LBL) or super short base line (SSBL) of the support system. Thanks to the proposed method, AUVs can perform near-seafloor surveys requiring real-time and accurate positioning, such as seafloor imaging and sampling, without these support systems. The method was implemented on two AUVs: Tri-Dog 1 and Tri-TON. The performance of the method was verified using these AUVs through sea experiments and postprocessing simulation using experimental data. In addition, it was also verified that the performance of the method is comparable to high-grade conventional navigation methods, such as LBL or SSBL, through simulations of long distance navigation.

AB We consider a static decision model related to the management of a Dial-a-Ride (DAR) system involving small autonomous electrical vehicles in a closed industrial site. Because of the specific features of the system, in this paper we concentrate on its reliability and propose a model that aims at assigning requests to vehicles by minimizing the number of loading/unloading operations. We propose an integer linear programming formulation of such Stop Number Minimization Problem and examine the behavior of some of its variants. Next, we consider and analyze a set covering oriented reformulation of the model. Finally, we propose a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) based heuristic approach that implements insertion mechanisms and is well fitted to realistic dynamic contexts. All proposed methods are tested on benchmark instances involving some tens of requests. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID REBALANCING PROBLEM; ALGORITHM
AB To facilitate the intelligent and automated provision of mobility services by autonomous transportation systems, bike-sharing can be a supplement to public transport for addressing their point-to-point issue, namely, "last mile" service. However, according to the different nature of land use, the uneven spatio-temporal distribution of travel demand can directly lead to difficult access to bikes with high travel costs for users and operating costs for operators. Based on this, this paper analyzes the user behavior patterns within different areas by using GeoHash encoding and proposes a hierarchical autonomous vehicle scheduling model based on tide bicycle-sharing traffic, namely, HATB. It minimizes operating costs and maximizes user satisfaction to dynamically optimize scheduling routes and required vehicles within each layered zone. As for extracting historical orders of Mobike in Beijing, an example analysis through the genetic algorithm of HATB is conducted to support effective and efficient scheduling. Compared to existing scheduling methods, HATB has faster convergence and lower time complexity, which improves bike turnaround efficiency and practical application ability, thus making it more convenient for the public to travel during peak hours.

AB An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) can replace a human to operate in a complex underwater environment, so it must have the ability of self-fault diagnosis. Existing deep learning-based diagnostic methods have achieved excellent performance, but designing effective neural network structures is a time-consuming and difficult task. Although neural network architecture search can automatically search effective neural network structures in a certain search space, neural architecture search (NAS) algorithms are usually slow and expensive; therefore, this article introduces a time-efficient NAS-based AUV fault diagnosis framework (TENAS-FD). TENAS-FD constructs a novel scoring algorithm that effectively gives a metric to characterize the performance of an untrained network. This metric is given based on the overlapping activation between data points in the untrained network with different inputs. This allows TENAS-FD to search for superior network architectures in seconds on a single graphics processing unit (GPU). Experiments were conducted on a real AUV dataset and showed that TENAS-FD can quickly obtain excellent network architectures for AUV fault diagnosis and has better diagnostic performance compared to hand-designing models.

AB Autonomous navigation and positioning are key to the successful performance of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) in environmental monitoring, oceanographic mapping, and critical marine infrastructure inspections in the sea. Cameras have been at the center of attention as an underwater sensor due to the advantages of low costs and rich content information in high visibility ocean waters, especially in the fields of underwater target recognition, navigation, and positioning. This paper is not only a literature overview of the vision-based navigation and positioning of autonomous UUVs but also critically evaluates the methodologies which have been developed and that directly affect such UUVs. In this paper, the visual navigation and positioning algorithms are divided into two categories: geometry-based methods and deep learning-based. In this paper, the two types of SOTA methods are compared experimentally and quantitatively using a public underwater dataset and their potentials and shortcomings are analyzed, providing a panoramic theoretical reference and technical scheme comparison for UUV visual navigation and positioning research in the highly dynamic and three-dimensional ocean environments.

AB This article investigates the autonomous demand response (ADR) in a building microgrid incorporating photovoltaic (PV) generation and plug-in electric vehicles. Two operation models are introduced in this article to enhance the self-utilization of PV power: 1) mixed integer programming (MIP)-based optimization model; and 2) the game theoretic model. To avoid the disadvantages of MIP-based centralized optimization in a decentralized approach, a non-cooperative ADR game framework is formulated based on the proposed virtual cost mechanism for each player to help in selecting the optimal consumption strategy coordinately. The existence of the unique Nash equilibrium which coincides with the optimal solution of the MIP-based operation model is proved. In addition, an iterative algorithm is developed to determine the equilibrium solution for the ADR game. Simulation results verify that the non-cooperative game-based ADR program is effective in improving the utilization of PV energy and benefits to microgrid systems.

AB In this work, a six degrees-of-freedom (DOF) nonlinear kinematic and dynamic model of a Hybrid Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (H-AUV) is derived for the two modes of locomotion, propelled and gliding modes. A comprehensive linearization algorithm is developed to include both modes of locomotion. Starting with a three-dimensional time-parameterized curve of position history, Frenet-Serret frames are used to specify the unknown nominal states, which in turn are used to obtain the nominal inputs. A linear time-variant (LTV) state-space model is obtained, and a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is designed and applied to the nonlinear model. The performance of the devised controller is assessed via a metric that computes the error between the actual and the desired position. Simulation results show that the LQR provides accurate tracking performance, even in the presence of underwater currents with bounded flow velocity. Moreover, the controller autonomously switches modes between propulsion and gliding to ensure minimal trajectory tracking error and energy consumption.

AB This paper investigates a fixed-time leader-following formation control method for a set of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with event-triggered acoustic communications. First, an event triggering communication strategy is developed to govern the communications between leader AUV and follower AUVs. Then, using a fixed-time control theory and a Lyapunov functional method, a compensator based command filtered formation control algorithm is proposed, with which the follower AUVs can track the leader AUV in a given fixed time. Namely, the control method can guarantee all the signals in the formation control system to be globally fixed-time stabilized. With the presented fixed-time control scheme, the predesignated AUVs formation can be achieved within a fixed settling time under arbitrary initial system states, which is otherwise impossible under any existing methods including finite-time control. Furthermore, the compensator-based command filtered control technique makes the designed formation control law simple and easy to implement in practice. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

AB The measurement error sources of the multibeam echosounder system (MBES) mounted on the deep-sea autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) are analyzed according to the composition features of the system. By analyzing the AUV sailing poses, the installation deviation of the multibeam measuring probe and the navigation and positioning system, the depth error estimation model and the position error estimation model of MBES are established. Based on the models above, the simulation is carried out considering the installation error of MBES. The deep-sea AUV conducted a sea trial at a drilling well site in Bohai Sea with a fixed depth of 7 m above the seafloor. The pose fluctuation of the AUV is derived. By comparing with topography in the area of the well site, the validity of the depth error estimation model and the position error estimation model are tested. The results provide design considerations of the integration installation of MBES to the AUV system. They are also important for the measurement data pose processing for MBES. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

   SUBJECT; DESIGN
AB This paper presents a new fuzzy output feedback control design for autonomous vehicle steering under actuator saturation, unavailability of the sideslip angle measurement, unknown road curvature, and lateral wind force. To take into account the actuator constraint, the saturation effect is transformed into dead-zone nonlinearity. A static output controller based on non-compensation parallel distributed technic and a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) model of vehicle lateral dynamics is proposed to consider the unavailability of some vehicle states. To avoid the problem of imposing bounds on membership functions time derivatives resulting from the use of the fuzzy Lyapunov approach, a proper integral structure based on the non-quadratic Lyapunov approach is investigated. The mixed H-2/H-infinity. stabilization conditions of the augmented closed-loop system are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, the robustness and the advantages of the proposed approaches are demonstrated through different tests.

AB Passengers are more susceptible to motion sickness (MS) than the drivers because during cornering, they tilt their heads according to lateral acceleration direction, while the drivers tilt their heads against it. During slalom driving, high lateral acceleration that resulted from inappropriate wheel's turning will increase the severity level of MS as it contributes to a larger passenger's head roll angle towards the lateral acceleration direction. Thus, for an autonomous vehicle, it is necessary to design a smooth lateral control to obtain appropriate wheel angle to prevent high lateral acceleration. This study proposes an inner-loop lateral control strategy which utilized head roll angle as the controlled variable to generate corrective wheel angle to reduce the lateral acceleration. Firstly, an estimation model of driver's and passenger's head roll angle is developed by radial basis function network method based on the correlation between lateral acceleration and occupant's head roll angle. The driver's and passenger's models are considered as the reference and the controlled subject, respectively. Secondly, a fuzzy logic controller is adopted to generate corrective wheel angle based on the head roll angle responses. The reduction of the lateral acceleration caused by the corrective wheel angle minimized the passenger's head roll angle and hence mitigated their MS level. Simulation results show 3.25% and 10.86% reduction of motion sickness incidence in a single lap and ten laps after the proposed control strategy is applied. It is expected that the proposed control strategy will contribute to the MS mitigation study in autonomous vehicle field.

AB Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are nowadays an indispensable component of production lines in smart manufacturing. Managing the fleet of AGVs covers not only the delegation of operational tasks but also the monitoring of AGVs activity and health condition by applying tailored Machine Learning-based methods to detect anomalies in various signals gathered by edge IoT devices mounted on board. Detecting anomalies requires appropriate prediction of selected signals based on multiple types of sensor readings. Momentary energy consumption is one of the signals that can indicate abnormal states in AGVs. In this paper, we show that the prediction of this signal can be improved with the Federated Learning (FL) approach that involves exchanging experience gained by particular AGVs. This paper significantly extends the conference paper (Shubyn et al., 2022) with the new multi-round approach to building global prediction models and recent experiments on real data streams produced by AGVs designed by the AIUT company. The results of our experiments prove that in the AGV operational environments with distributed knowledge Federated Learning performs better than traditional centralized approaches and that frequent synchronization of experience may lead to better prediction quality.

AB This paper presents an approach, using an anticipatory kinodynamic motion planner, for obtaining the best trajectory and velocity profile for autonomous driving in dynamic complex environments, such as driving in urban scenarios. The planner discretizes the road search space and looks for the best vehicle path and velocity profile at each control period of time, assuming that the static and dynamic objects have been detected. The main contributions of the work are in the anticipatory kinodynamic motion planner, in a fast method for obtaining the G(2)-splines for path generation, and in a method to compute and select the best velocity profile at each candidate path that fulfills the vehicle kinodynamic constraints, taking into account the passenger comfort. The method has been developed and tested in MATLAB through a set of simulations in different representative scenarios, involving fixed obstacles and moving vehicles. The outcome of the simulations shows that the anticipatory kinodynamic planner performs correctly in diverse dynamic scenarios, maintaining smooth accelerations for passenger comfort.

AB Autonomous landing of an unmanned aerial vehicle or a drone is a challenging problem for the robotics research community. Previous researchers have attempted to solve this problem by combining multiple sensors such as global positioning system (GPS) receivers, inertial measurement unit, and multiple camera systems. Although these approaches successfully estimate an unmanned aerial vehicle location during landing, many calibration processes are required to achieve good detection accuracy. In addition, cases where drones operate in heterogeneous areas with no GPS signal should be considered. To overcome these problems, we determined how to safely land a drone in a GPS-denied environment using our remote-marker-based tracking algorithm based on a single visible-light-camera sensor. Instead of using hand-crafted features, our algorithm includes a convolutional neural network named lightDenseYOLO to extract trained features from an input image to predict a marker's location by visible light camera sensor on drone. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art object trackers both using and not using convolutional neural network in terms of both accuracy and processing time.

AB In this paper, a novel model reference adaptive controller with anti-windup compensator (MRAC_AW) is proposed for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Input saturations and parametric uncertainties are among the practical problems in the control of autonomous vehicles. Hence, utilizing a proper adaptive controller with the ability to handle actuator saturations is of a particular value. The proposed technique of this paper incorporates the well-posed model reference adaptive control with integral state feedback and a modern anti-windup scheme to present an appropriate performance in practical conditions of an AUV. Stability of the proposed method is analyzed by Lyapunov theory. Then, the proposed controller is implemented in the hardware in the loop simulation of AUV. For this purpose, the introduced method is implemented in an onboard computer to be checked in a real-time dynamic simulation environment. Obtained results in the presence of real hardware of system, actuators, computational delays and real-time execution verify the effectiveness of proposed scheme. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

DE Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV); compact receiver; magnetic

AB Design and fabrication of a practical wireless charging system, which includes a submerged docking station and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with power pick-up capability, is proposed to recharge an AUV safely and autonomously. First, a docking design, based on a funnel-type docking station, an acoustic and optical combination guiding method and a position locking mechanism, is presented to smoothly dock the AUV and eliminate the dynamic disturbance during the charging process. Then, a novel magnetic structure with an overlapped direct-quadrature transmitter and a dipole receiver is proposed. The two-layer transmitting windings, decoupling each other, form a constant amplitude traveling wave under the space-time coordination mechanism for suppressing output fluctuation with misalignments. Moreover, a practical wireless charging circuit, based on current doubler, is developed, modeled and analyzed. Finally, an experimental prototype is constructed to verify the proposal. The system can deliver 1.2 kW to the load with a system efficiency of 90%, and especially the proposal achieves stable output in the range of rotational misalignment of [-30 degrees, 30(degrees)] and axial misalignment of [-30 mm, 30 mm].

AB - This paper aims to address formation control for multiple underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the presence of disturbances and unknown dynamic parameters. Firstly, a novel leader-follower formation tracking error dynamics is established by coordinate transformation, which is relevant to the range, bearings and roll angle. The double-loop controller based on integral terminal sliding mode control (ITSMC) is then developed to achieve finite-time convergence. Therein, in the outer loop, the virtual velocity commands are designed for the subsequent control loop. Meanwhile, the control inputs are designed to force AUV's velocities to the virtual velocity commands in the inner loop. Minimal learning parameter (MLP) technique-based radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is also incorporated with the adaptive laws to deal with unknown dynamic parameters and external disturbances. Besides, the stability analysis is comprehensively analyzed to exhibit the stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, the numerical benchmark tests demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed methods.

AB This paper investigates the environmental trade offs resulting from the adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs) as a function of modal shifts and use phase. An empirical approach is taken to formulate a mode choice model informed from a stated preference (SP) survey conducted in Madison, Wisconsin. A life cycle analysis based on well-to-wheel model is then conducted to quantify the use phase environmental impacts across different categories. The mode choice analysis reveals the potential users of AVs and its attractiveness as a mode of transportation, ultimately competing with traditional modes available. This translates into modal shifts that are shown to result in an expected increase in environmental impacts across all studied categories: energy consumption (5.93%), greenhouse gas emissions (5.72%), particulate matter (6.80%), sulfur (6.85%) and nitrogen oxides (5.70%). The adoption of electric AVs (E-AVs) is then analyzed as an offsetting strategy to combat the increase in environmental impacts. The analysis reveals that E-AVs are capable of offsetting the foreseen impacts, yet their effectiveness is dependent on the electricity generation mix and adoption rate.

AB Beamforming is an advanced signal processing technique used in sensor arrays for directional signal transmission or reception. The paper deals with a system based on an ultrasound transmitter and an array of receivers, to determine the distance to an obstacle by measuring the time of flight and - using the phase beamforming technique to process the output signals of receivers for finding the direction from which the reflected signal is received - locates the obstacle. The embedded beam-former interacts with a PID-based line follower robot to improve performance of the line follower navigation algorithm by detecting and avoiding obstacles. The PID (proportional-integral-derivative) algorithm is also typically used to control industrial processes. It calculates the difference between a measured value and a desired set of points, then attempts to minimize the error by adjusting the output. The overall navigation system combines a PID-based trajectory follower with a spatial-temporal filter (beamformer) that uses the output of an array of sensors to extract signals received from an obstacle in a particular direction in order to guide an autonomous vehicle or a robot along a safe path.

AB The control issues in nonlinear trajectory tracking of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) are a challenging task due to the complex oceanic environment, highly nonlinear coupled dynamics, imprecise hydrodynamic coefficients and unpredictable external disturbances such as ocean waves, current fluctuations and tides. This paper addresses an adaptive fuzzy PI sliding mode control (AFPISMC) for trajectory tracking control of AUV to achieve high precise maneuvering in undersea environment. An AFPISMC is basically comprised of an equivalent control based on approximately known inverse dynamic model output and continuous adaptive PI term is designed to eliminate chattering effect. Furthermore, it does not require a priori knowledge of upper bounds on uncertainties in the dynamic parameters of an AUV. In this approach, decoupled single input fuzzy PI control strategy is employed along with a reduced rule base and self-tuning control law is derived to modify hitting gain in order to enhance tracking response. The overall control scheme guarantees the global asymptotic stability based on Lyapunov theory. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through simulation and comparison studies.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are a vital part of the oceanographer's toolbox, allowing long-term measurements across a range of ocean depths of a number of ocean properties such as salinity, fluorescence, and temperature profile. Buoyancy-based gliding, rather than direct propulsion, dramatically reduces AUV power consumption and allows long-duration missions on the order of months rather than hours or days, allowing large distances to be analyzed or many successive analyses of a certain area without the need for retrieval. Recent versions of these gliders have seen the buoyancy variation system change from electrically powered to thermally powered using phase-change materials, however a significant battery pack is still required to power communications and sensors, with power consumption in the region of 250 mW. The authors propose a novel application of a thermoelectric generation system, utilizing the depth-related variation in oceanic temperature. A thermal energy store provides a temperature differential across which a thermoelectric device can generate from repeated dives, with the primary purpose of extending mission range. The system is modeled in Simulink to analyze the effect of variation in design parameters. The system proves capable of generating all required power for a modern AUV.

The WWO algorithm based on shallow wave theory is a novel evolutionary algorithm that mimics wave motions containing propagation, refraction and breaking to obtain the global optimization solution. The WWO algorithm not only avoids jumps out of the local optimum and premature convergence but also has a faster convergence speed and higher calculation accuracy. To verify the effectiveness and feasibility, the WWO algorithm is applied to solve the randomly generated threat areas and generated fixed threat areas. Compared with other algorithms, the WWO algorithm can effectively balance exploration and exploitation to avoid threat areas and reach the intended target with minimum fuel costs. The experimental results demonstrate that the WWO algorithm has better optimization performance and is robust.

AB Autonomous driving (AD) perception today relies heavily on deep learning based architectures requiring large scale annotated datasets with their associated costs for curation and annotation. The 3D semantic data are useful for core perception tasks such as obstacle detection and ego-vehicle localization. We propose a new dataset, Navya 3D Segmentation (Navya3DSeg), with a diverse label space corresponding to a large scale production grade operational domain, including rural, urban, industrial sites and universities from 13 countries. It contains 23 labeled sequences and 25 supplementary sequences without labels, designed to explore self-supervised and semi-supervised semantic segmentation benchmarks on point clouds. We also propose a novel method for sequential dataset split generation based on iterative multi-label stratification, and demonstrated to achieve a +1.2% mIoU improvement over the original split proposed by SemanticKITTI dataset. A complete benchmark for semantic segmentation task was performed, with state of the art methods. Finally, we demonstrate an Active Learning (AL) based dataset distillation framework. We introduce a novel heuristic-free sampling method called ego-pose distance based sampling in the context of AL.

AB With the development of ocean exploration technology, the exploration of the ocean has become a hot research field involving the use of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In complex underwater environments, the fast, safe, and smooth arrival of target points is key for AUVs to conduct underwater exploration missions. Most path-planning algorithms combine deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and path-planning algorithms to achieve obstacle avoidance and path shortening. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the local minimum in the artificial potential field (APF) to make AUVs out of the local minimum by constructing a traction force. The improved artificial potential field (IAPF) method is combined with DRL for path planning while optimizing the reward function in the DRL algorithm and using the generated path to optimize the future path. By comparing our results with the experimental data of various algorithms, we found that the proposed method has positive effects and advantages in path planning. It is an efficient and safe path-planning method with obvious potential in underwater navigation devices.

AB The issue of dynamic event-triggered trajectory tracking control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the Trans-Atlantic Geotraverse (TAG) active mound is addressed. Concretely, a novel adaptive event-triggered disturbance observer along with auxiliary functions is constructed to handle with actuator faults and ocean current in the TAG active mound. By using rotation matrices, a new tracking error system involving position and attitude is developed such that potential singularities caused by the large pitch will be sufficiently avoided. By deep combination with model parameters, a sliding mode manifold based on additional velocity errors is established to promote robustness and convergence. Following the detailed analysis, sufficient conditions for the input-to-state practical stability in mean square are given to ensure the tracking performance. An adaptive dynamic event-trigger method is applied to reduce the communication frequency between the embedded PC module and actuators. Finally, the applications of an AUV tracking system in the near-bottom hydrothermal mound are carried out to verify the efficiency of the presented method.

AB This work renders the design of a robust state feedback optimal control strategy for an Autonomous Underwater Robotic Vehicle (AURV). The control strategy is developed using a polytopic approach based on hydrodynamic parameter variation. Besides, a backstepping approach is designed to control the kinematics of the system. However, the dynamics of the AURV system are controlled by a robust optimal control technique. In this work, the decoupled systems for both horizontal and vertical dynamics of AURV are used for the development of the control algorithms. Furthermore, the 3-D path following is achieved by integrating the control algorithms of both horizontal and vertical dynamics of AURV. The proposed controller is formulated using semi-definite programming (SDP). To track the 3-D path, it is intended to track both the desired depth and desired yaw in diving and steering planes. The simulation studies are conducted through MATLAB/Simulink environment using the YALMIP tool. Furthermore, the robust behavior of the proposed control algorithm is verified by considering the uncertain hydrodynamic parameters.

AB This paper addresses the target tracking problem of an under-actuated autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) subject to internal uncertainties and exogenous forces in ocean environments with static and dynamic obstacles. A collision-free target tracking (CFTT) control method is proposed based on a guiding vector field (GVF) guidance and a super-twisting algorithm (STA) control. Specifically, a resultant GVF is developed to guide the ASV towards the target position and to avoid multiple obstacles. Based on the resultant GVF, a saturated guidance law is designed to calculate the surge velocity and angular velocity commands. Then, robust exact differentiator (RED)-based observers are developed to estimate the lumped disturbances within finite time. By using the estimated lumped disturbances, STA-based anti-disturbance kinetic control laws are designed to track the given velocity commands within finite time. The finite-time input-to-state stability of the closed-loop system is proven based on cascade theory. Emulational and experimental validations are conducted to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed CFTT control method.

AB In this paper, we solve the trajectory tracking control problem of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with actuator faults and model uncertainties. In order to achieve the output tracking with prescribed transient performance, we develop a novel tan-type barrier Lyapunov function (BLF)-based funnel tracking control strategy to constrain the position tracking error of the AUV within prespecified performance funnels. Furthermore, to maintain the predesigned transient tracking performance of the AUV when the actuator fault occurs, an event-triggered adaptive fuzzy fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme is proposed to compensate actuator faults. Meanwhile, to handle the uncertainties caused by the system model, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are adopted to approximate the unknown hydrodynamic parameters and actuator fault parameters. Different from the existing results, the communication burden and the excess wear from the controller to the actuators are reduced utilising the event-triggered mechanism. By using the theory of Lyapunov stability, it is proven that all the signals of the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly bounded. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by a simulation example.

AB In this paper, we focus on the problem of highway merge via parallel-type on-ramp for autonomous vehicles (AVs) in a decentralized non-cooperative way. This problem is challenging because of the highly dynamic and complex road environments. A deep reinforcement learning-based approach is proposed. The kernel of this approach is a Deep Q-Network (DQN) that takes dynamic traffic state as input and outputs actions including longitudinal acceleration (or deceleration) and lane merge. The total reward for this on-ramp merge problem consists of three parts, which are the merge success reward, the merge safety reward, and the merge efficiency reward. For model training and testing, we construct a highway on-ramp merging simulation experiments with realistic driving parameters. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can make reasonable merging decisions based on the observation of the traffic environment. We also compare our approach with a state-of-the-art approach and the superior performance of our approach is demonstrated by making challenging merging decisions in complex highway parallel-type on-ramp merging scenarios.

AB The research presented in this paper is aimed at developing a control algorithm for an autonomous surface system carrying a two-sensor array consisting of two acoustic receivers, capable of measuring the time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) of a quasiperiodic underwater acoustic signal and utilizing this value to steer the system toward the acoustic source in the horizontal plane. Stability properties of the proposed algorithm are analyzed using the Lie bracket approximation technique. Furthermore, simulation results are presented, where particular attention is given to the relationship between the time difference of arrival measurement noise and the sensor baseline-the distance between the two acoustic receivers. Also, the influence of a constant disturbance caused by sea currents is considered. Finally, experimental results in which the algorithm was deployed on two autonomous surface vehicles, each equipped with a single acoustic receiver, are presented. The algorithm successfully steers the vehicle formation toward the acoustic source, despite the measurement noise and intermittent measurements, thus showing the feasibility of the proposed algorithm in real-life conditions.

AB This paper presents a state-feedback-based backstepping control algorithm to address the point stabilization (or setpoint regulation) control problem for an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the presence of constant and irrotational ocean current disturbance. A nonlinear three degree of freedom dynamic model in the horizontal plane for an AUV without symmetry fore/ aft is considered. The expression of the relationship between the desired heading angle of the AUV and direction angle of the ocean current, which is a necessary condition for precise point stabilization control of an underactuated AUV in the presence of ocean current disturbance is firstly discussed in this paper. The proposed backstepping control law for point stabilization has further been enriched by incorporating an additional integral action for enhancing the steady state performance of the AUV control system, while practical asymptotic stability analysis of the system is carried out using Lyapunov theory and Barbalat's Lemma. Simulation experiments of an underactuated AUV verify the theorem proposed and demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller.

AB The fast development of communication technique builds an era of Internet of Everything. In the automobile world, Internet-Connected Vehicle (CV), also called IntelliDrive, will accelerate the autonomous driving era's coming. And the traffic flow theory will undergo major changes as CV platoon becomes common way for our travel. As we know that the CV has different driving decision mechanisms from human-driven vehicles, such as an CV can receive more information and make much faster decision than a human-driven vehicle. Only if we fully understand the autonomous traffic flow's characteristics, then we can improve the level of traffic engineering study and management in the future. On the thought of building autonomous traffic flow theory, we present CV platoon car-following model as the theoretical microscopic traffic flow model. The model is described by a mathematical differential-difference equation, which has a synthesized optimal velocity differential function and a full platoon with weighted relative velocity difference function. There are three main factors in the model, which are the optimal velocity difference impact factor.. and action related vehicle number l, and weighted velocity difference sum coefficient lambda. The model reflects the effects of front interactions between every two adjacent CV instead of the weighted average headway in the platoon. We deduce the model's stability conditions with linear system stability theory and do some computer numerical simulations to verify our suppositions. Simulation results show that the more information broadcasting among CV, the more stable of the traffic flow system is. At last, we discuss our study's contributions from the viewpoint of theoretical and practical value, and point out future research directions. In a word, the highlight of the paper is that we find the CV platoon system's running mechanism by building an CV platoon car-following model under connected environment and give its linear stability condition, which is great value for advanced traffic management in autonomous driving era.

AB Smart cities are developing at increasing speed. Smart cities rely on the deployment of information and communication technology (ICT) that is digitally transforming our habitats. Digital transformation affects several areas from transportation, energy, government to the environment. But, primarily, it affects citizens. Therefore, the adoption of all areas of the smart city holds great research potential. The purpose of this paper is thus to provide an insight into millennials? adoption of autonomous vehicles (AV), which are at the forefront of future transport. Millennials are an important focus group for smart city concepts since they are keen to adopt technology and new transport modes. Our research focuses on technology adoption, perception of the benefits, security, safety, mobility-related efficiencies and concerns as the key AV adoption factors. The impact of these factors is empirically tested with structural equation modelling using data from 382 millennials. We confirm the perceived benefits of AV are vital factors for AV adoption whereas the perceived safety of AV significantly reduces the influence of various concerns regarding AV.

AB The aim of this study was to describe the position of pedestrians and pedal cyclists relative to the striking vehicle in the 3 s before Impact. This information is essential for the development of effective autonomous emergency braking systems and relevant test conditions for consumer ratings. The UK RAIDS-OTS study provided 175 pedestrian and 127 pedal-cycle cases based on in-depth, at-scene investigations of a representative sample of accidents in 2000-2010. Pedal cyclists were scattered laterally more widely than pedestrians (90% of cyclists within around +/- 80 degrees compared to +/- 20 degrees for pedestrians), however their distance from the striking vehicle in the seconds before impact was no greater (90% of cyclists within 42 m at 3 s compared to 50 m for pedestrians). This data is consistent with a greater involvement of slow moving vehicles in cycle accidents. The implication of the results is that AEB systems for cyclists require almost complete 180 degrees side-to-side vision but do not need a longer distance range than for pedestrians.

AB Introduction: Modem automobiles are going through a paradigm shift, where the driver may no longer be needed to drive the vehicle. As the self-driving vehicles are making their way to public roads the automakers have to ensure the naturalistic driving feel to gain drivers' confidence and accelerate adoption rates. Method: This paper filters and analyzes a subset of radar data collected from SHRP2 with focus on characterizing the naturalistic headway distance with respect to the vehicle speed. Results: The paper identifies naturalistic headway distance and compares it with the previous findings from the literature. Conclusion: A clear relation between time headway and speed was confirmed and quantified. A significant difference exists among individual drivers which supports a need to further refine the analysis. Practical applications: By understanding the relationship between human driving and their surroundings, the naturalistic driving behavior can be quantified and used to increase the adoption rates of autonomous driving. Dangerous and safety-compromising driving can be identified as well in order to avoid its replication in the control algorithms. (C) 2017 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, we propose a sonar-image-based underwater-hovering algorithm for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Unlike the conventional methods that apply vision-based algorithms, the proposed algorithm predicts the sonar image of the target position in advance, and then compares the sonar image of the current position of the AUV to the predicted sonar image in order to derive the current position error. By feeding back the error, the AUV can compensate for its position error. We verify the accuracy and tolerance of the proposed algorithm by performing an experiment using a forward-looking imaging sonar.

AB The optimal formation configuration for underwater localization of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with a more general measurements model is investigated. The evaluation function is derived on the basis of Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) or the corresponding Fisher information matrix (FIM). We determine the optimal formation configuration for the regular placement and the linear placement patterns, respectively. Subsequently, the influence of the measurements model on the optimal formation and the sensitivity of the localization performance to the factors, separation angle and range, are also presented. The simulation results demonstrate that the localization performance is more sensitive to the range rather than to the separation angle.

AB In the context of automated highway systems (AHS), this work proposes an approach that enables a vehicle to autonomously join a platoon with optimized trajectory in the presence of dynamical traffic obstacles. A notable aspect is the use of Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimization of the planned path, in conjunction with a variant of the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT*) algorithm for the purpose of platoon formation. This combination efficiently explores the space of possible trajectories, returning trajectories that are smoothened out with respect to the dynamic constraints of the vehicle, while at the same time allowing for real-time implementation. The implementation we propose takes into consideration both localization and mapping through relevant sensors and V2V communication. The complete algorithm is tested over various nominal and worst-case scenarios, qualifying the merits of the proposed methodology.

AB Multi-point vehicular positioning is an essential operation for autonomous vehicles. However, the state-of-the-art positioning technologies, relying on reflected signals from a target (i.e., RADAR and LIDAR), cannot work without line-of-sight (LoS). Besides, it takes significant time for environment scanning and object recognition with potential detection inaccuracy, especially in complex urban situations. Some recent fatal accidents involving autonomous vehicles further expose such limitations. In this article, we aim at overcoming these limitations by proposing a novel relative positioning approach, called Cooperative Multi-point Positioning (COMPOP). The COMPOP establishes cooperation between a target vehicle (TV) and a sensing vehicle (SV) if a LoS path exists, where a TV explicitly lets an SV to know the TV's existence by transmitting positioning waveforms. This cooperation makes it possible to remove the time-consuming scanning and target recognizing processes, facilitating real-time positioning. One prerequisite for the cooperation is a clock synchronization between a pair of TV and SV. To this end, we use a phase-differential-of-arrival (PDoA) based approach to remove the TV-SV clock difference from the received signal. With clock difference correction, the TV's position can be obtained via peak detection over a 3D power spectrum constructed by a Fourier transform (FT) based algorithm. The COMPOP also incorporates nearby vehicles, without knowing their locations, into the above cooperation for the case without a LoS path. Specifically, several strong non-LoS (NLoS) links from the TV to the SV can be generated via mirror-like reflections over the neighboring vehicles' metal surfaces. Following the same procedures in the LoS case, virtual TVs mirrored by nearby vehicles can be detected. By exploiting the geometric relation between the virtual and actual TVs, COMPOP can be achieved by intelligently combining the virtual TVs to position the actual TV. The effectiveness of the COMPOP is verified by several simulations concerning practical channel parameters.

AB In this article a new Data-Driven formulation of the Particle Filter framework is proposed. The new formulation is able to learn an approximate proposal distribution from previous data. By doing so, the need to explicitly model all the disturbances that might affect the system is relaxed. Such characteristics are particularly suited for Terrain Based Navigation for sensor-limited AUVs, where typical scenarios often include non-negligible sources of noise affecting the system, which are unknown and hard to model. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the superior accuracy, robustness and efficiency of the proposed Data-Driven approach.

AB We consider the optimal control design of an abstract autonomous vehicle (AAV). The AAV searches an area for tasks that are detected with a probability that depends on vehicle speed, and each detected task can be processed or ignored. Both searching and processing are costly, but processing also returns rewards that quantify designer preferences. We generalize results from the analysis of animal foraging behavior to model the AAV. Then, using a performance metric common in behavioral ecology, we explicitly find the optimal speed and task processing choice policy for a version of the AAV problem. Finally, in simulation, we show how parameter estimation can be used to determine the optimal controller online when density of task types is unknown. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are attractive tools to survey earth science and oceanography, however, there exists a lot of problems to be solved such as motion control, acquisition of sensor data, decision-making, navigation without collision, self-localization and so on. In order to realize useful and practical robots, underwater vehicles should take their action by judging the changing condition from their own sensors and actuators, and are desirable to make their behavior, because of features caused by the working environment. We have been investigated the application of brain-inspired technologies such as Neural Networks (NNs) and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) into AUVs. A new controller system for AUVs using Modular Network SOM (mnSOM) proposed by Tokunaga et al. is discussed in this paper. The proposed system is developed using recurrent NN type mnSOM. The efficiency of the system is investigated through the simulations.

TI Curved-path and velocity control of an autonomous guided vehicle using

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING

DT Article
AB We develop a new algorithm for an autonomous guided vehicle (AGV) with curved-path and velocity control by applying fuzzy logic. The curved-path and velocity control of an AGV has two significant problems: (1) rotation-angle and deceleration when the AGV follows a curved-path; (2) acceleration when the AGV leaves the curved-path. In order to solve these problems, this paper presents an algorithm that enables the current AGV speed to reduce properly when it begins the curved-path, and to then rapidly recover the original speed. We verify the validity of the algorithm through simulation and show that the AGV reaches its destination without changing speed rapidly on the curved-path.

We prepared copper oxide nanofibers by electrospinning, characterized the obtained materials by XRD, SEM, and TEM, and fabricated MEMS sensors based on copper oxide nanofibers. The humidity sensitivity performance of the sensor was tested in different humidity environments. We found that the MEMS humidity sensor based on copper oxide nanofibers can detect the change of humidity in the environment over a large humidity range. Its fast response/mixing speed (1 s), good stability, and sensitivity make it to fully adapt to the high speed of the car.

AB This paper focuses on autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) stabilization in the nonlinear descriptor model, as well as some AUV limitations such as model uncertainty, singularity, saturation constraint, and time delay. The capability of the descriptor model to show the real model is more reasonable than the standard state-space model. Based on the constructed Lyapunov function method and applying the bilinear matrix inequalities technique, all of the constraints are handled by introducing the new theorem. This theorem aims to design a state feedback with the intent that the closed-loop system be admissible. Here, the results are less conservative than other approaches. This issue has not yet been fully addressed in the literature, especially on AUVs. Theorem achievement is implemented on new AUV descriptor model that is obtained and introduced here. This method covers both neutral and descriptor systems. Also, it can be generalized and applied to conventional AUVs or similar dynamics. Examples and simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Aiming at the problem of routing voids in underwater sensor networks (UWSNs) routing, we propose an energy-efficient routing void repair method (this method is called (EERVRM) based on autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for UWSNs. First, we identify void nodes and trap nodes through a void detection mechanism, which allows EERVRM to discover the routing void before data transmission. Then, an AUV designs the trajectory of each round according to the location of the routing voids and collects data directly from the nodes near the trajectory. The nodes that are farther from the AUV transmit data through an opportunistic routing strategy so that EERVRM can adapt to the dynamic changes in the network and repair the network void. Simulation results show that EERVRM can effectively solve routing void problems, ensure a stable transmission rate. Compared with VAPR and GEDAR, as the number of nodes increases, the average end-to-end delay of EERVRM decreased by 0.29 and 0.13, and the packet delivery ratio (PDR) increased by 0.25 and 0.1, respectively.

AB Industrial applications involving mobile systems can benefit from the use of wireless technology. However, wireless communication has not been widely accepted on the factory floor due to its difficulty in achieving the timely and reliable transmission of messages over error-prone wireless channels. This paper presents an autonomous guided vehicle (AGV) path tracking wireless control system where an accurate delay estimation scheme is shown to be the key for successful operation. The control architecture consists on an AGV connected through a wireless network to a controller. To mitigate the negative effects that varying time delays in data transfer have in the networked control loop, the controller performs two tasks at each loop operation. First, it uses a Kalman filter to produce an optimal delay estimate considering a simple stochastic model of the wireless delay dynamics. Second, each delay estimate is employed to infer the real AGV position which permits to compute the appropriate control commands. Results show that the proposed technique provides more efficient and effective operation for path tracking control compared to similar previously proposed solutions.

AB Value of Time (VOT) is a key element in transport infrastructure planning decisions. It is widely believed that travellers using autonomous vehicles (AVs) will have a lower VOT than conventional vehicles (CVs) because of improved road safety, increased road capacity, engagement in productive activity during travel and increased mobility. A number of researchers have measured VOT effects of AVs though no consolidation of this evidence has been undertaken to date. This is the first study to provide a quantitative summary and synthesis of the estimated VOT of AV travel including a synthesis of factors affecting AV VOT. Meta-analyses of 24 studies show that mean VOTs for conventional cars, private AVs and shared AVs are respectively 17.3, 12.1 and 19.4 AU$/hr. However, wide variations in these estimates are evident and 12 factors have been identified with statistically significant effects on these variations including geographical context, study experimental characteristics, trip characteristics and socio-economic factors. We found that AV VOT estimates are lower when animated videos are used to demonstrate AV capabilities. Private AVs have the lowest VOT estimates as do commute trips and morning peak periods. Young adults (18-30 years) and people with current driving experience consistently report lower AV VOT while those with higher educational status and higher-incomes report having higher AV VOT. Implications of findings for policy and future research are presented.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have a great potential to improve traffic efficiency in mixed traffic systems, which has been demonstrated by multiple numerical simulations and field experiments. However, some fundamental properties of mixed traffic flow, including controllability and stabilizability, have not been well understood. This paper analyzes the controllability of mixed traffic systems and designs a system-level optimal control strategy. Using the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus (PBH) criterion, we prove for the first time that a ring-road mixed traffic system with one CAV and multiple heterogeneous human-driven vehicles is not completely controllable, but is stabilizable under a very mild condition. Then, we formulate the design of a system-level control strategy for the CAV as a structured optimal control problem, where the CAV's communication ability is explicitly considered. Finally, we derive an upper bound for reachable traffic velocity via controlling the CAV. Extensive numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of our analytical results and the proposed control strategy. Our results validate the possibility of utilizing CAVs as mobile actuators to smooth traffic flow actively.

   Using autonomous underwater vehicles equipped with telemetry-based payload control to locate marine fish tagged with acoustic transmitters.
   Abstract An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) under payload control (PC) was used to map the movements of juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) tagged with acoustic transmitters. After detecting a tag, the AUV deviated from its pre-programmed route and performed a maneuver designed to enhance the location estimate of the fish and to move closer to collect proximal environmental data. Nineteen fish were released into marine waters of southeastern Alaska. Seven missions with concurrent AUV and vessel-based surveys were conducted with two to nine fish present in the area per mission. The AUV was able to repeatedly detect and estimate the location of the fish, even when multiple individuals were present. Although less effective at detecting the fish, location estimates from the vessel-based surveys helped verify the veracity of the AUV data. All of the fish left the area within 48 h of release. Most fish exhibited localized movements (milling behavior) before leaving the area. Dispersal rates calculated for the fish suggest that error associated with the location estimates was minimal. The average movement rate was 0.62 body length per second and was comparable to marine movement rates reported for other Chinook salmon stocks. These results suggest that AUV-based payload control can provide an effective method for mapping the movements of marine fish.

AB This paper presents an application of a recently proposed methodology for modeling connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in heterogeneous traffic flow, to investigate the impact of setting dedicated lanes for CAVs on traffic flow throughput. A fundamental diagram approach was introduced which reveals the pros and cons of setting dedicated lanes for CAVs under various CAV penetration rates and demand levels. The performance of traffic flow under different number of CAV dedicated lanes is compared with mixed flow situation. Simulation results indicate that at a low CAV penetration rate, setting CAV dedicated lanes deteriorates the performance of the overall traffic flow throughput, particularly under a low density level. When CAVs reach a dominant role in the mixed flow, the merits of setting dedicated lanes also decrease. The benefit of setting CAV dedicated lane can only be obtained within a medium density range. CAV penetration rate and individual CAV performance are significant factors that decide the performance of CAV dedicated lane. The higher level of performance the CAV could achieve, the greater benefit it will attain through the deployment of CAV dedicated lane. Besides, the performance of CAV dedicated lane can be improved through setting a higher speed limit for CAVs on the dedicated lane than vehicles on other normal lanes. This work provides some insights into the impact of the CAV dedicated lane on traffic systems, and helpful in deciding the optimal number of dedicated lanes for CAVs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB This article proposes an adaptive non-singular integral terminal sliding mode-based fault tolerant control (ANITSM-FTC) method for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) exposed to uncertainty of dynamics and potential unknown thruster failures. The developed control scheme shows unique superiority in convergence rate over the existing adaptive proportional-integral sliding mode-based fault tolerant control (APISM-FTC), and overcomes the singularity problem effectively compared to traditional sliding mode-based scheme. During the design of the ANITSM-FTC controller, radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and adaptive technique are adopted to estimate the dynamics uncertainty. Rigorous theoretical analysis and rigorous mathematical proof based on the trajectory tracking problems of AUVs are implemented, to ensure all tracking errors asymptotically converge to zero. To more fully demonstrate the viability of the proposed ANITSM-FTC method, the simulation experiments are carried out with three different thruster failure conditions by a fair comparison of APISM-FTC. The proposed scheme inherits the advantages of dealing with the problem of possible thruster failures as well as overcoming the drawbacks of other methods.

AB This paper concentrates on the issue of finite-time coordinated formation control of discrete-time multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with input saturation and time-varying communication delay un-der alterable weighted topology. Firstly, the nonlinear kinematic and dynamic equations of the AUV are represented as an affine nonlinear system, which is then transformed into a discrete-time model. Then, by introducing auxiliary control, the coordinated controller with saturation constraints is designed for the multi-AUV system, and the state error system between followers and virtual leader is established. Based on matrix theory and associated definition of stability, sufficient conditions consisting of inequalities to ensure that the error system is stable are derived in the absence and presence of communication delay, respectively. These conditions ensure the multi-AUV system can achieve required formation in finite time. Finally, some simulations are shown to prove the validity of the control framework and theoretical results. And simulation comparisons indicate the significance of communication topology and time delay to the control system.

DE Autonomous vehicles; Parents' intentions; Travel safety; School travel
AB High-level autonomous vehicles (AVs) are likely to improve the quality of children's travel to and from school (such as improve travel safety and increase travel mobility). These expected benefits will not be presented if parents are not willing to use AVs. Therefore, it is necessary to explore parents' intentions of using AVs to transport children to and from school (parents' intentions). This study has two primary aims: 1) Exploring parents' intentions and their potential determinants. 2) Making recommendations for manufacturers to develop and market AVs suitable for school travel based on the research results. Research results show that face consciousness with Chinese characteristics can significantly affect parents' intentions. Knowledge of AVs is the most significant factor in influencing parents' intentions. Perceived usefulness, attitude towards school travel in AVs, and perceived risk can significantly affect parents' intentions. The direct impact of perceived ease of use and public engagement on parents' intentions is not significant. Finally, this research could provide decision-making support for governments and manufacturers to formulate relevant policies and marketing strategies, promoting parents' acceptance of AVs.

AB The use of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has the potential to transform users' behaviour and urban space management. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of impacts require a scenario building method. We considered the fleet size, modal share, car ownership, parking preferences, and urban space repurposing during the elaboration of a novel method. Existing scenarios and results of a questionnaire survey have been used as sources. The method was applied to build scenarios in a case study in Budapest, Hungary. The results were used to calculate the impacts on urban space management, including environmental savings. The key findings are: scenarios with significant shared AV use show that parking demand may be minimised (almost 83%) and urban space repurposing has the highest potential; furthermore, AV use and sharing acceptability may decrease the fleet size and alter the type of shared mode to multiple occupancies. The developed scenario building method serves as a base for future studies. The produced scenarios allow the researchers to focus on the analysis of the impacts caused.

AB Fish-cage dysfunction in aquaculture installations can trigger significant negative consequences affecting the operational costs. Low oxygen levels, due to excessive fooling's, leads to decrease growth performance, and feed efficiency. Therefore, frequent periodic inspection of fish-cage nets is required, but this task can become quite expensive with the traditional means of employing professional divers that perform visual inspections at regular time intervals. The modern trend in aquaculture is to take advantage of IT technologies with the use of a small-sized, low-cost autonomous underwater vehicle, permanently residing within a fish cage and performing regular video inspection of the infrastructure for the entire net surface. In this study, we explore specialised image processing schemes to detect net holes of multiple area size and shape. These techniques are designed with the vision to provide robust solutions that take advantage of either global or local image structures to provide the efficient inspection of multiple net holes.

AB This paper presents results from the ALLEGRO-07 survey that was carried out from 1 to 15 September 2007 across the continental shelf in the Bay of Biscay by the RV "Thalassa". The main objectives were to conduct experiments with a medium-sized, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with a fishery-acoustic scientific payload. This was needed to overcome the difficulties of sampling the surface and bottom blind zones, which are inaccessible to conventional, vessel-mounted transducers used for acoustic surveys in the Bay of Biscay. The AUV acoustic datasets from four dives were compared with those from the research vessel. The results were expressed for the nautical-area-scattering coefficient (s(A)) and biomass estimates. The AUV provided higher s(A) measurements than did the vessel. For particular environmental and fish-distribution patterns, the biomass estimated by the AUV was more than ten times that estimated by the vessel alone. The results presented indicate the magnitude of the error that may occur in acoustic surveys, if the biomass in the two blind zones is undetected.

AB Highly accurate sensor extrinsic calibration is critical for data fusion from multiple sensors, such as camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor suit. A pre-calibrated extrinsics, however, may no longer be accurate due to external disturbances, e.g., vehicle vibration, which will lead to significant performance deterioration of autonomous vehicles. Existing approaches rely on online recalibration at a fixed frequency regardless of whether the extrinsics have actually been changed or recalibration is needed, which is computationally inefficient. In this letter, we present an approach to monitor extrinsic calibration quality for camera-IMU sensor suite to determine when recalibration is actually necessary. We propose an efficient algorithm to detect robust road image features, utilize IMU data to capture the mismatches of those features, and quantify extrinsic calibration error through three commonly-used error metrics. Our algorithm is demonstrated to be effective using both simulated and real-world data.

AB This paper addresses the 3D trajectory tracking control of an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) under uncertain model parameters and unknown external disturbances. A dynamic surface control scheme based on neural network and adaptive technique is proposed. In controller design, the first-order integral filters are employed to estimate derivative of virtual control, which avoid repeated derivative of virtual control. To deal with the effect of unknown external disturbances and uncertain model parameters, the neural network and adaptive technique are combined to approximate unknown nonlinear functions. All of the error signals in the closeloop system are uniformly ultimately bounded based on Lyapunov stability theory. Simulation studies and comparisons with adaptive dynamic surface control scheme illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control scheme.

AB Increasing the dimensionality of the configuration space quickly makes trajectory planning computationally intractable. This paper presents an efficient motion planning approach that exploits the heterogeneous low-dimensional structures of a given planning problem. These heterogeneous structures are obtained via a Dirichlet process (DP) mixture model and together cover the entire configuration space, resulting in more dimensionality reduction than single-structure approaches from the existing literature. Then, a unified low-dimensional trajectory optimization problem is formulated based on the obtained heterogeneous structures and a proposed transversality condition which is further solved via SQP in our implementation. The positive results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our trajectory planning approach on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and a high-dimensional intervention autonomous underwater vehicle (I-AUV) in cluttered 3D environments.

AB Accurate path following control plays an important role for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) in the oceanic surveys and exploration. In the consideration with nonlinearity and external disturbance, the dynamic model of a portable AUV has been established on the basis of its actuation and control characteristics. An adaptive nonlinear second order sliding mode controller has been deduced to eliminate the chattering motion through a sliding surface during the path following control. On the uncertainties of external disturbances, an adaptive tuning law has been selected to estimate the upper bound of disturbance. In the lake experiments, the proposed controller not only provides better response with faster convergence and smaller overshoot, but also eliminates the chattering effect of control output, in compare with the controller with linear and PID second order sliding mode surface.

AB In this study, a neural network-based control design is developed for underactuated autonomous surface vehicles moving in a leader-follower formation, in the presence of uncertain leader dynamics as well as uncertain local dynamics caused by coriolis and centripetal force, hydrodynamic damping, unmodelled hydrodynamics and disturbances from environment. By online approximating the uncertain leader dynamics, the proposed method only uses the measurements of line-of-sight range and angle by local sensors, no other information about leader is required for control implementation. The proposed control law is model-independent that does not rely on the accurate model of the vehicle, which is difficult to obtain in practice. Based on the Lyapunov synthesis, it is proved that with the developed neural formation controller, all the tracking errors converge to a small neighbourhood of zero. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

AB Vehicles have irregular shapes and inter-vehicle coordination is not a trivial task. Based on the distributed-system framework, this paper studies multi-vehicle control and coordinated obstacle avoidance for multiple autonomous vehicles with irregular shapes. The goal is to reach target points without collisions. The proposed approaches are based on collision time, which is calculated using vehicles' irregular shapes. The approaches have two parts. The first part enables a number of vehicles to reach the target points. The second part enables collision avoidance, which includes inter-vehicle collisions and vehicle-to-obstacle collisions. Speed regulation approach is proposed to change the speeds, and frequency-modulation approach is proposed to update control commands at varying steps, and a combined approach is also proposed. Simulation examples are set to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

AB Coverage path planning with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a core task for many services and applications including search and rescue, precision agriculture, infrastructure inspection and surveillance. This work proposes an integrated guidance and gimbal control coverage path planning (CPP) approach, in which the mobility and gimbal inputs of an autonomous UAV agent are jointly controlled and optimized to achieve full coverage of a given object of interest, according to a specified set of optimality criteria. The proposed approach uses a set of visibility constraints to integrate the physical behavior of sensor signals (i.e., camera-rays) into the coverage planning process, thus generating optimized coverage trajectories that take into account which parts of the scene are visible through the agent's camera at any point in time. The integrated guidance and gimbal control CPP problem is posed in this work as a constrained optimal control problem which is then solved using mixed integer programming (MIP) optimization. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB For autonomous unmanned vehicles (AUVs), navigation control is an essential concern in academia. Conventionally, existing research works dealt with this issue by resorting to the "Simultaneous Localization and Mapping" (SLAM) technology. Although many SLAM-based approaches had been proposed in recent years, they could not mostly perceive semantic characteristics from dynamic visual scenarios. To deal with this challenge, this paper proposes a navigation control approach for AUVs via a deep learning-enhanced visual SLAM framework. Firstly, the commonly used coordinate system in the motion of AUVs is analyzed, and a mathematical description of the circular arc motion of AUVs is formulated. Then, an up-convex curve model is adopted to realize high-accuracy detection of the bilateral lane lines. On the foundation, a yaw angle guidance-based imitation learning framework is utilized to realize navigation control. This well facilitates the analyzing the causal relationship between scenarios and decisions. Some experiments are conducted by simulating real-world urban road scenes, to testify the efficiency of the navigation control for AUVs. The results show that navigation accuracy can be improved by about 5%.

AB A robust model predictive controller (RMPC) based on the H-infinity criterion is proposed for accomplishing effective path following motion plan of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) in face of uncertainties, external disturbances, and actuator constraints. A factorized Extreme Learning Machine (FELM) dynamic model of an AUV is proposed in this paper to identify the dynamics of AUV. Further, the parameters of the FELM model are updated at every sampling instant to accommodate any parameter variations in the AUV dynamics. The aforesaid FELM dynamic model is used to design a robust model predictive controller using Linear Matrix Inequality. The simulation and experimental results envisage that a robust path following performance is achieved in face of uncertainties and disturbances whilst avoiding actuator saturation. A comparison in terms of tracking performance is carried out between the proposed controller and the H-infinity state feedback controller. From the obtained simulation and experimental results, it is inferred that, in face of actuator constraints and external disturbances, the proposed controller demonstrates efficient tracking performance compared to the H-infinity state feedback controller.

AB In recent times, the utilization of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has been significantly increased over the globe. It is because of the tremendous rise in familiarity and the usage of artificial intelligence approaches in distinct application areas. Though AVs offer several benefits like congestion control, accident prevention, and so on, energy management and traffic flow prediction (TFP) remain a challenging issue. This paper concentrates on the design of intelligent energy management and TFP (IEMTFP) technique for AVs using multi-objective reinforced whale optimization algorithm (RWOA) and deep learning (DL). The proposed model involves an energy management module using fuzzy logic system to reach the specified engine torque with respect to different measures. For optimal tuning of the variables involved in the fuzzy logic membership functions (MFs), RWOA is employed to further reduce the energy utilization. Besides, the proposed model uses a DL-based bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) technique to perform TFP. For validating the efficacy of the IEMTFP technique, an extensive experimental validation is carried out. The resultant values ensured the goodness of the IEMTFP model in terms of energy management and TFP.

AB Autonomous 3-D exploration with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is increasingly prevalent for environment monitoring without human intervention. In this article, we present a systematic solution toward efficient UAV exploration in 3-D environments. Innovatively, a road map is incrementally built and maintained along with the exploration process, which explicitly exhibits the topological structure of the 3-D environment. By simplifying the environment, the road map can efficiently provide the information gain and the cost-to-go for a candidate region to be explored, which are two quantities for next-best-view (NBV) evaluation, thus prompting the efficiency for NBV determination. In addition, with reference to the global plan queried on the road map, we propose a local planner based on the potential field method that drives the robot to the information-rich area during the navigation process, which further improves the exploration efficiency. The proposed framework and its composed modules are verified in various 3-D environments, which exhibit their distinctive features in NBV selection and better performance in improving the exploration efficiency than other methods.

AB Safe driving is a relatively new concept that focuses on solving the responsibility attribution problem for autonomous vehicles (AVs), claiming that once the AVs follow a series of pre-defined safe driving policies, it is free from liability even when accidents happen. In this work, we propose safe driving policies for traffic configurations, including straight road, intersection, and Manhattan-like city. Base on the defined safe driving policies, we offer the concepts of safe driving capacity (SDC) and safe driving throughput (SDT) to measure the safe efficiency of the traffic configurations. The former measures the maximum AVs a traffic configuration could accommodate, and the latter measures the maximum throughputs of safe AVs of a traffic configuration. The values obtained are the fundamental limits of the traffic efficiencies for liability-free AVs under the defined conditions. The theoretical performance bounds give people insights on the potential limitations of the safe traffic efficiencies. Finally, this work provides analytical results of SDC and SDT on all the traffic configurations mentioned with explanations, implications, and trade-offs on the issues that may have effects on them.

Prior to the onset of upwelling, the plume was mixed by a combination of energetic downwelling winds and bottom-generated shear resulting in a two-layer plume structure. Estimates of turbulent dissipation and buoyancy flux from a nose-mounted microstructure system indicate that scalar exchange within the plume was patchy and transient, with direct wind mixing constrained to the near surface by stratification within the plume. Changing wind and tide conditions contributed to temporal variability. Following the separation of the upper plume from the coast, alongshore shear became a significant driver of mixing on the shoreward edge of the plume.
   Plain Language Summary Turbulence measurements made by an autonomous underwater vehicle reveal that the wind-driven offshore movement of a coastal river plume leads to intermittent and patchy mixing of plume and shelf waters. These novel, high-resolution observations highlight the importance of capturing transient features when determining the fate of rivers on continental shelves.

AB Autonomous vehicles rely on a combination of sensors for safe navigation around the world. For precise localisation, high-definition (HD) maps are used. These maps are a representation of the world containing information about objects on the road infrastructure. Currently, there are tens of HD map makers, however, no rigorous description of the requirements for the accuracy of HD maps has been published yet. This study fills the gap and offers a mathematical description of the minimum required accuracy for HD maps. In the first part, we identify factors that influence the quality of a map. Based on that, we proceed to present our solution for determining the minimum required accuracy for HD maps, both for static and dynamic models, and present a new formula for the minimum necessary accuracy for HD maps.

AB Conventional underwater navigation and positioning methods for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) either require the installation of acoustic arrays, which make AUVs less independent, or result in cumulative errors. This paper proposes an Underwater Terrain Positioning Method (UTPM) using Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation and a Pulse Coupled Neural Network (PCNN) model for highly accurate navigation by AUVs. The PCNN model is used as a secondary discriminant to effectively identify pseudo-anchor points in flat terrain feature areas and to find the true positioning point, which significantly improves the matching positioning accuracy in these areas. Simulation results show that the proposed method effectively corrects Inertial Navigation System (INS) cumulative errors and has high matching positioning accuracy, which satisfy the requirements of AUV underwater navigation and positioning.

Using only onboard GPS-denied sensing and computation, we perform obstacle detection, planning, and feedback control in real time. We present a novel integrated approach to perception and control using pushbroom stereo, which exploits forward motion to enable efficient obstacle detection and avoidance using lightweight processors on an unmanned aerial vehicle. Our use of model-based planning and control techniques allows us to track precise trajectories that avoid obstacles identified by the vision system. We demonstrate a complete working system detecting obstacles at 120 Hz and avoiding trees at up to 14 m/s (31 MPH). To the best of our knowledge, this is the fastest lightweight aerial vehicle to perform collision avoidance using three-dimensional geometric information.

TI Using ontologies to aid navigation planning in autonomous vehicles
SO KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING REVIEW

DT Review
AB This paper explores the hypothesis that ontologies can be used to improve the capabilities and performance of on-board route planning for autonomous vehicles. We name a variety of general benefits that ontologies may provide, and list numerous specific ways that ontologies may be used in different components of our chosen infrastructure: the 4D/RCS system architecture developed at NIST. Our initial focus is on simple roadway driving scenarios where the controlled vehicle encounters objects in its path. Our approach is to develop an ontology of objects in the environment, in conjunction with rules for estimating the damage that would be incurred by collisions with the different objects in different situations. Automated reasoning is used to estimate collision damage; this information is fed to the route planner to help it decide whether to avoid the object. We describe our current experiments and plans for future work.

ID ACTUATOR DELAYS; CRUISE CONTROL
AB In this paper, we develop a completely self-contained controller (SCC) for implementing all functions of autonomous intelligent cruise control (AICC). SCC consists of two modules: the decision module analyses the current scenario and infers control mode that associates with a certain manoeuvre; the control module implements the command provided by the decision. A rule-based logic is used in the decision to infer an appropriate manoeuvre. To execute the manoeuvre, a control scheme in the control module is designed to implement this task. It is proven that the proposed SCC can avoid slink-effect occurring when a vehicle string is moving on a highway. Examples are given to show that SCC can handle all possible traffic scenarios with satisfactory performance. The potential flow increases when all vehicles on a highway equipped with the proposed controller are examined by running a highway simulator in which the traffic is under very realistic assumptions.

ID SYSTEM
AB Currently, autonomous vehicles and intelligent robots are used in an extensive set of industrial applications. However, in the recent past, the frequency with which small obstacles arise on highways has risen dramatically, which will lead to severe incidents on highways. Hence, small obstacle detection is critical for increasing the efficiency of autonomous vehicles to enable their safe navigation to avoid road accidents. On the other hand, these small-size obstacles are of varying sizes, shapes, and colors and are difficult to be detected under low lighting and illumination conditions. Existing research studies suggest deep-learning-assisted semantic segmentation models; however, an optimal model along with improved performance is of greater necessity. From this perspective, we have suggested transfer learning-based approaches using state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models namely UNet++, PSPNet, PANNet, LinkNet, and DeepLabV3+ for the detection of small-size obstacles under strict lighting and illumination conditions. Furthermore, we used images of road scenes with extremely small-size obstacles, which were neglected by past research studies, since these obstacles were not included in the databases that they were using in their findings and may have failed to effectively address the problem of obstacle detection. Moreover, for faster and better convergence, we have modified the backbone architectures of these models with Residual-Network (ResNet)-18 and ResNet-34 trained on ImageNet weights. It is observed that DeepLabV3 + ResNet-18 as backbone architecture shows the highest results with a mean intersection-over-union score of 64% along with a 95% value of accuracy.

AB In order to track the desired path as fast as possible, a novel autonomous vehicle path tracking based on model predictive control (MPC) and PID speed control was proposed for high-speed automated vehicles considering the constraints of vehicle physical limits, in which a forward-backward integration scheme was introduced to generate a time-optimal speed profile subject to the tire-road friction limit. Moreover, this scheme was further extended along one moving prediction window. In the MPC controller, the prediction model was an 8-degree-of-freedom (DOF) vehicle model, while the plant was a 14-DOF vehicle model. For lateral control, a sequence of optimal wheel steering angles was generated from the MPC controller; for longitudinal control, the total wheel torque was generated from the PID speed controller embedded in the MPC framework. The proposed controller was implemented in MATLAB considering arbitrary curves of continuously varying curvature as the reference trajectory. The simulation test results show that the tracking errors are small for vehicle lateral and longitudinal positions and the tracking performances for trajectory and speed are good using the proposed controller. Additionally, the case of extended implementation in one moving prediction window requires shorter travel time than the case implemented along the entire path.

TI Autonomous Parking Path Tracking Control Based on Interference
   Suppression
SO IEEE ACCESS

DT Article
DE Autonomous parking; path tracking; extended state observer; interference
   suppression; sliding mode control
AB Owing to the increased demand for autonomous driving and advanced driver assistant systems, autonomous parking configurations have been widely researched. In order to solve the problem of path tracking accuracy degradation, caused by ignoring the external interference in the actual parking process and the uncertainty of vehicle steering modeling, a parking path tracking algorithm, combining Sliding Model Control (SMC) and Extended State Observer (ESO), is proposed. First, the vehicle kinematics model is established, which includes many external interference factors, such as lateral position, speed, heading angle, uncertainty parameters and time delay of steering mechanism. Considering the vehicle physical constraints and boundary condition constraints, during the parking process, the parking reference path is designed according to reverse outbound driving, while the parking collision analysis and path smoothing are further carried out. Next, an ESO is designed to observe and compensate the external disturbances and model uncertainties, treating these as the total disturbances of the system. On this basis, a SMC for parallel parking path tracking is designed. The observed value of ESO is used as the compensation in the SMC, to weaken the influence of external interference. Finally, using Matlab simulation, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed path planning and tracking control method are verified. The simulation results show that, the maximum tracking error of lateral position is less than 0.01m, whereas the maximum tracking error of heading angle is less than 2.5(degrees). Comparing two control strategies, the control effect of the designed SMC with ESO is better than that of the traditional SMC controller, while the ability of resisting external interference is stronger. In addition, real vehicle tests are carried out, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method. The test results show that, the vehicle can safely park in the parking space, quickly and accurately, even if there is external interference. The proposed method can produce the parking trajectory according to the given constraints and control the vehicle to complete the parking operation accurately along the planned path.

AB Three-dimensional path planning for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in underwater environments is the key to ensuring safe navigation and reliable mission completion. To obtain a safe and smooth three-dimensional path for an AUV in ocean currents and seabed obstacle environments, an improved compression factor particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed. First, a three-dimensional seabed environment model and Lamb vortex current environment model are constructed. Second, by considering optimization objectives such as travel distance cost, seabed terrain constraints and ocean current constraints, a three-dimensional path planning mathematical model is constructed. Finally, an improved compression factor particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed and applied to solve the multi-objective nonlinear optimization problem. To verify the optimization performance of the new algorithm, its optimization results are compared with those of other algorithms by minimizing the fitness value. The experimental results reveal that the improved compressed factor particle swarm optimal algorithm has better planning efficiency, path quality, and shorter planning time, which provides a new effective method for path planning of autonomous underwater vehicle.

AB This paper proposes a test scenario design method that reflects the longitudinal characteristics of reality for effective verification of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving systems (ADS). Since the target systems interact with the external environment differently from the existing vehicle control system, realistic and various verification scenarios are required for verification. The proposed method consists of a vehicle model for simulating the vehicle behavior and a driver model to actively respond to the driving environment. In particular, the driver model used a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm to reflect the characteristic of human drivers. The longitudinal driving characteristics of human drivers were derived through a large-scale driving database analysis and considered in the driver model. The proposed method was compared with an existing car-following model using computer simulations. It was confirmed that its longitudinal driving behavior is similar to that of human drivers and that various scenarios can be designed by changing the model parameters.

AB This paper focuses on the fault tolerant control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and potential thruster failure issues. For this, an adaptive proportional-integral sliding mode-based fault tolerant control (APISM-FTC) is proposed to drive the AUV to follow the desired trajectory, in the event of unknown thrusters failure and thrusters saturation. Radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and an adaptive approach are used to evaluate the dynamics uncertainty during the construction of the APISM-FTC controller. To guarantee that all tracking errors asymptotically converge to zero, a comprehensive theoretical analysis and mathematical proof based on Lyapunov stability analysis are implemented. The simulation experiments on two fault conditions are carried out, respectively, and the control effects under normal conditions are compared. It can be shown that the designed APISM-FTC method can make the system reach a stable state quickly, and can still have a good control performance in the case of the failure of the thruster.

AB This article studies the formation tracking problem of a team of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with the ocean current disturbances. A distributed Lyapunov-based model predictive controller (DLMPC) is designed such that AUVs can keep the desired formation while tracking the reference trajectory, despite the presence of external disturbances. The DLMPC inherits the stability and robustness of the extended state observer (ESO)-based auxiliary control law and invokes online optimization to improve formation tracking performance of the multi-AUV system. The closed-loop stability of the multi-AUV system is guaranteed by the stability constraint that utilizes the ESO-based auxiliary controller and the associated Lyapunov function. Furthermore, the inter-AUV collision avoidance can be achieved by incorporating well-designed artificial potential fields-based cost term in the formation tracking cost function. Extensive simulations on the Saab Falcon AUVs are carried out, demonstrating the superior control performance and robustness of the proposed method.

AB We review the development of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) use under sea ice to map the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of the ice underside. The author, after extensive experience in under-ice profiling from submarines using single-beam sonar, carried out the first under-ice sidescan sonar profiling from an AUV in 2002 in the Greenland Sea. This was followed in August 2004 by the first full multibeam sonar experiment, using Kongsberg EM2000 sonar aboard the Autosub-II vehicle off NE Greenland. Two experiments using a small Gavia vehicle deployed through holes in the ice followed in 2007 and 2008, in the Beaufort Sea and off Ellesmere Island. Examples of the 3-D imagery are shown, and the two approaches of using a large vehicle deployed from a ship and a small through-ice vehicle are compared and found to be complementary. The imagery has shown that although first-year (FY) ridges have the familiar shape of a triangular prism made of small ice blocks, multi-year (MY) ridges are found to be broken up by lead formation into a chain of individual large ice blocks rather than a coherent linear feature. New work and future plans are described.

AB This paper proposes a centralized MTT method based on a state-of-the-art multi-sensor labeled multi-Bernoulli (LMB) filter in underwater multi-static networks with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The LMB filter can accurately extract the number of targets and trajectories from measurements affected by noise, missed detections, false alarms and port-starboard ambiguity. However, its complexity increases as the number of sensors increases. In addition, due to the time-varying underwater environment, AUV detection probabilities are time-varying, and their mismatches often lead to poor MTT performance. Consequently, we detail a robust multi-sensor LMB filter that estimates detection probabilities and multi-target states simultaneously in real time. Moreover, we derive an effective approximate form of the multi-sensor LMB filter using Kullback-Leibler divergence and develop an efficient belief propagation (BP) implementation of the multi-sensor LMB filter. Our method scales linearly with the number of AUVs, providing good scalability and low computational complexity. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in underwater multi-AUV network MTT simulations.

AB Subsea homing and docking systems are used for increasing the spatiotem-poral capabilities of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) involved in long en-durance scientific, survey, and surveillance missions. They offer necessary guidance for the AUV, and maneuver into the dock, considering the vehicle atti-tude and the dynamic response capabilities. Short-range homing is critical for successful docking as carrying outgross course and heading corrections is diffi-cult when the AUV is closer to the dock. The article describes the development of an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled short-range AUV electro-magnetic homing guidance system (EMHGS) based on differential magnetometry principle. System engineering is carried out with the aid of electromagnetic Finite Element Analysis software; supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms are implement-ed for determining the range and heading correction in real time. The proposed algorithms aid the reliable and accurate homing operation in an unknown dynamic environment, and the algorithm is very easily implementable and independent of AUV configuration and payloads. The EMHGS with an AI-enabled MagHomer AUV is demonstrated for autonomous intelligent homing over a range of 7 m.

AB This paper is concerned with the issue of time-varying formation containment control for multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (MAUVs) system subject to actuator saturation in three-dimensional space. The adaptive saturation dynamic filter technology is incorporated to reduce the influence of actuator saturation on the MAUVs system. For the sake of actively compensating the total disturbance containing the unknown nonlinearities and external disturbances, the extended state observers (ESOs) are customized, thus improving the anti-disturbance capability of MAUVs system. The tracking differentiators (TDs) are employed into estimating the derivatives of the proposed virtual control laws and dealing with the matter of explosion of complexity. Furthermore, via Lyapunov stability analysis, it is proven that the designed control laws can effectively guarantee that the leader AUVs are capable of tracking the virtual leader AUV with time-varying offset vectors, and at the same time the follower AUVs are capable of being steered into the convex hull formed by the leader AUVs. At last, a numerical simulation is implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI Road geometry perception without accurate positioning and lane

ID SENSOR-FUSION; LOCALIZATION
AB Road geometry perception indicates road direction and drivable area for Lane Keeping System and Lane Departure Warning System in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems or routing and decision-making in Autonomous Driving. High-definition map with accurate positioning or lane information is generally required. However, these two types of information are not always available because of positioning failure or lane mark degradation. In this paper, a road geometry estimation method is proposed without requirement of accurate positioning and lane information. Due to the fact the lane guides the front vehicle, the potential correlation between the relative azimuth of front vehicle and the direction of road is explored. The stable and observable information of front vehicles are exploited, such as the license plate location. A radar-camera fusion system using image processing, and a nonlinear system is then built with Unscented Kalman Filter to estimate the road curvature. Simulation results with Carla demonstrate that the method enhances the road geometry perception by 77.1%, compared with the baseline method. The proposed method can provide reliable road geometry information for autonomous driving when accurate positioning and lane information are unavailable, so that it renders more robust and safer perception for future autonomous driving.

AB This research presents a way to improve the autonomous maneuvering capability of a four-degrees-of-freedom (4DOF) autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to perform trajectory tracking tasks in a disturbed underwater environment. This study considers four second-order input-affine nonlinear equations for the translational (x,y,z) and rotational (heading) dynamics of a real AUV subject to hydrodynamic parameter uncertainties (added mass and damping coefficients), unknown damping dynamics, and external disturbances. We proposed an identification-control scheme for each dynamic named Dynamic Neural Control System (DNCS) as a combination of an adaptive neural controller based on nonparametric identification of the effect of unknown dynamics and external disturbances, and on parametric estimation of the added mass dependent input gain. Several numerical simulations validate the satisfactory performance of the proposed DNCS tracking reference trajectories in comparison with a conventional feedback controller with no adaptive compensation. Some graphics showing dynamic approximation of the lumped disturbance as well as estimation of the parametric uncertainty are depicted, validating effective operation of the proposed DNCS when the system is almost completely unknown.

AB This paper studies the trajectory tracking control problem of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). We develop a novel Lyapunov-based model predictive control (LMPC) framework for the AUV to utilize computational resource (online optimization) to improve the trajectory tracking performance. Within the LMPC framework, the practical constraints, such as actuator saturation, can be explicitly considered. Also, the thrust allocation subproblem can be addressed simultaneously with the LMPC controller design. Taking advantage of a nonlinear backstepping tracking control law, we construct the contraction constraint in the formulated LMPC problem so that the closed-loop stability is theoretically guaranteed. Sufficient conditions that ensure the recursive feasibility, and hence the closed-loop stability, are provided analytically. A guaranteed region of attraction is explicitly characterized. In the meantime, the robustness of the tracking control can be improved by the receding horizon implementation that is adopted in the LMPC control algorithm. Simulation results on the Saab SeaEye Falcon model AUV demonstrate the significantly enhance trajectory tracking control performance via the proposed LMPC method.

   controller tuning; time-varying cost
AB Parameters tuning of the model and the controller is an essential problem for autonomous vehicles. Traditionally, parameter tuning work is accomplished by manual operation or grid search, which is a tedious and time-consuming work. Recently, thanks to the development of machine learning community, several automatic controller parameter tuning approaches emerged, which usually model the performance function as a Gaussian process, and complete the automatic tuning procedure via Bayesian optimization. However, the existing approaches rarely consider the time-varying feature of the system performance, which is practical in many scenarios, induced by the unmodeled interactions between the system and the environment. In this paper, we take both of the dynamic model uncertainty and the controller parameters uncertainty into account, and tune them to find a global optimal choice for minimizing the time-varying control costs, which is modeled by the time-varying Gaussian process. We provide a novel algorithm, named as time-varying controller optimization. We validate our approach on synthetic simulation and real experiment, respectively. Taking the cumulative regret as the performance metric, we find that our approach has a better performance compared with the stationary algorithm.

ID SELECTION
AB Deep learning (DL) brings autonomous vehicles (AVs) close to reality. However, the witness of many safety issues has raised a big concern about the reliability of AVs. To solve this problem, much research has been done to test deep learning-driven AVs. Generally, once a test input is produced, a developer needs to manually check its expected output. However, there often exists massive unlabeled test data (e.g., raw context traces in the real world). It is impractical to manually label all test inputs. Despite some works on automatic generation of test oracles, they are either task-specific or constrained to synthetic inputs. In this paper, we present a general and extensible framework, DeepSuite, to mitigate the manual effort of generating test oracles. The intuition behind is that not all test inputs are equally worth labelling. With limited testing budget, it is desirable to label a test suite with high diversity and a reasonable size. Due to the large search space, to optimize such test suites is of great challenge. To address it, DeepSuite employs a three-phase optimization method (i.e., selection, crossover, and mutation) to iteratively select representative but non-redundant test suites. Such conflicting profit/cost objectives are attained through a genetic algorithm with a well-defined multi-objective fitness function. In the experiments, we first show that the diversity of tests can be revealed by test criteria. Then, experiments on three widely-used datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of DeepSuite in generating test suites with competitive testing coverage and 68.42% smaller size, which greatly improves the data collection efficiency of testing DL-driven autonomous vehicles.

This work studies the performance of a hybrid algorithm combining pheromone maps, market auction paradigms and proactive link maintenance mechanisms to create a self-organizing flying network capable of providing network support for the UAV nodes already engaged in exploration and targeting tasks in the surveillance missions. In order to validate the proposal, simulations were performed assessing the desired performance aspects related to the target allocation and network connectivity. The acquired results provide evidence that the proposed solution is able to maintain the balance between the performance goals.

AB A fast optimization method based on the Gauss pseudospectral method (GPM) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is studied for trajectory optimization of obstacle-avoidance navigation of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). A multi-constraint trajectory planning model is established according to the dynamic constraints, boundary constraints, and path constraints. The trajectory optimization problem is converted into a non-linear programming (NLP) problem by means of the GPM, which is solved by the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm. Aiming at the initial values dependence of the SQP algorithm, a method combining PSO pre-planning with the GPM is proposed. The pre-planned trajectory points are configured on the Legendre-Gauss (LG) points of the GPM by fitting as the initial values for the SQP calculated trajectory planning problem. After simulation analysis, the convergence speed of the optimal solution can be accelerated by using the pretreated initial values. Compared to the linear interpolation and the cubic spline interpolation, the PSO pre-planning method improves computational efficiency by 82.3% and 88.6%, which verifies the effectiveness of the PSO-GPM to solve the trajectory optimization problem.

AB An autonomous underwater vehicle is able to conduct coverage detections, such as sea terrain mapping and submerged objects detection, using sonar. This work addresses the task of both optimizing and following routes that present a ladder shape. First, a planning method to determine a nearly optimal coverage route is designed. The track spacing is optimized considering the seabed type and the sonar range for the purpose of increasing detection probability. It also adds adaptability to confined water, such as harbors, by decomposing the geometrically concave mission region during the processing of the environmental data. Next, a decoupled and two-layered structure is adopted to design the following controller. The route is followed in the form of sequenced-lines tracking. A proportion-integral-derivative algorithm with fuzzy parameters adjustment is employed to calculate a reference heading angle according to the transverse position deviation in designing the guidance controller. An adaptive nonlinear S-surface law is adopted to design the yaw control. The route following the method is demonstrated with sonar (including side scanning sonar and multi-beam echo sounder) imagery collected in terrain mapping and object detection through sea trials.

ID SPHERICAL-SHELL
AB The feasibility of resolving target returns within receive signals collected by a continuously transmitting quasi-monostatic, broad-band, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) based sonar is explored. Theoretical studies supported by experimental results suggest that it is possible to capture the source-to-receiver coupling response and target scattering with sufficient fidelity during the continuous transmission to enable detection and (potentially) classification processing. Demonstrations focused upon the detection of a bottomed target object at sea using transmit signals with duty cycles of 60% and 100% indicate that such an approach is feasible for a representative AUV-based side looking sonar system operating in shallow water.

AB The data-based method for estimating the depth of a moving source is demonstrated experimentally for an incoming autonomous underwater vehicle traveling toward a vertical line array (VLA) of receivers at constant speed/depth. The method assumes no information on the sound-speed and bottom profile. Performing a wavenumber analysis of a narrowband signal for each hydrophone, the energy of the (modal) spectral peaks as a function of the receiver depth is used to estimate the depth of the source, traveling within the depth span of the VLA. This paper reviews the theory, discusses practical implementation issues, and presents the data analysis results. (C) 2016 Acoustical Society of America

AB Automated vehicles (AVs) have received intense attention in academia and industry around the world in recent years, but the imminent introduction of AVs brings new challenges and opportunities for transportation networks and built environments. It is important to understand the potential infrastructure-related requirements of AVs and their impact on road infrastructure in order to assess the readiness of the existing road network and prepare plans for future roads. This paper seeks to address what the implications of automated vehicles will likely be for the road infrastructure based on a comprehensive literature review. To investigate this issue, two broad questions were framed: What are the potential effects of AVs on physical road infrastructure; and What do AVs require from road infrastructure for safe driving. A total of thirteen key topics around infrastructure have been identified from the existing literature regarding vehicle automation that needs to be considered during either the initial phase of deployment or transition to full automation. In the light of the identified topics, the paper presents potential changes and challenges, making recommendations for future research directions to ensure a safe and efficient operation.

AB This paper reports on the status and design of the operational remotely operated vehicle "Victor 6000", rated for 6000 m depth and of the 3000 rn depth autonomous underwater vehicle "Aster"' operated by Ifremer the French Institute for Sea Exploitation. Victor 6000 is part of a global system built of subsystems, "scientific modules," winch and cable, dead weight and umbilical, positioning subsystem using acoustic ultra short base line (USBL) techniques, and software for data and dive management. In 2005 the system was equipped with a second toolsled dedicated to high resolution mapping of the sea bed, with both acoustical and optical devices. Aster(x), the first autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) developed by IFREMER, is 4.5 m in length with a diameter of 0.69 m. Depending on the payload, its weight is between 600 and 800 kg in air, with a diving depth of 3000 m. Its cruising speed is between 0.5 and 2.5 ms. The AUV is capable of carrying various payloads for a wide spectrum of applications. The vehicle can cruise up to 100 km. For coastal applications this vehicle is operable by a limited crew potentially from a nonspecialized vessel. Both vehicles are used for oceanography as well as to continually evolve underwater systems to address new scientific challenges. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Emergence of communication technologies made the automotive industries across the globe to embrace Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) by considerable investments to ensure accident-free travel, reduction of pollution, fuel conservation. ADAS achieves its goals by integrating complex subsystems such as obstacle avoidance, overtaking advice, lane changing assistance, planning shortest routes, parking assistance, automatic gear shifting, etc., using the emerging technologies. This article emphasizes the road safety aspect of the ADAS by exploring Crash Avoidance and Overtaking Advice (CAOA) subsystems. Existing studies have a noticeable lack of connectivity between various aspects of CAOA subsystems. This review deeply explores and connects CAOA subsystems like road geometries, road debris, obstacle avoidance algorithms powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), overtaking advice systems, perception challenges of human drivers in various light and weather conditions, driver inattention and misjudgments, vehicle blind-spots, vehicle parameter analysis, performance of vision sensors, in-vehicle computers, driver-vehicle interactions, Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) technologies. This article emphasizes the three primary performance metrics of the ADAS, namely accuracy, response time and robustness. Finally, this article discusses a typical functional architecture and gaps identified in existing studies. This article is structured to assist like-minded researchers, who work on CAOA systems for road safety.

AB In this paper, the problem of steering control is investigated for vehicle path tracking in the presence of parametric uncertainties and nonlinearities. In practice, the vehicle mass varies due to the number of passengers or amount of payload, while the vehicle velocity also changes during normal cruising, which significantly influences vehicle dynamics. Moreover, the vehicle dynamics are strongly nonlinear caused by the tire/road forces under different road surface conditions. With fuzzy modeling method, the original nonlinear path tracking system with parameter variations is first formulated as a T-S fuzzy model with additive norm-bounded uncertainties, and then an approach to the fuzzy observer-based output feedback steering control for vehicle dynamics is proposed under a fuzzy Lyapunov function framework. By employing matrix inequality convexifying techniques, a sufficient condition is developed in the form of linear matrix inequalities such that the closed-loop path tracking error system is asymptotically stable with a guaranteed H-infinity level. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy observer-based output feedback controller is demonstrated in Carsim/Matlab joint simulation environment, via which the advantage of a T-S fuzzy observer-based output controller over the closed-loop driver model embedded in Carsim is also shown with parametric uncertainties and nonlinearities.

AB In this study a novel microsimulation-based methodology for environmental assessment of urban systems is developed to address the performance of autonomous mass-mobility against conventional approaches. Traffic growth and microsimulation models, calibrated using real data, are utilised to assess four traffic management scenarios: business-as-usual; public bus transport case; public-bus rapid transit (BRT) case; and, a traffic-demand-responsive-autonomous-BRT case, focusing on fuel energy efficiency, headways, fleet control and platooning for lifecycle analysis (2015-2045) of a case study 3.5 km long 5-lane dual-carriageway section. Results showed that both energy consumption and exhaust emission rates depend upon traffic volume and flow rate factors of vehicle speed-time curves; acceleration-deceleration; and braking rate. The results measured over-reliance of private cars utilising fossil fuel that cause congestions and high environmental footprint on urban roads worsen causing excessive travel times. Public transport promotion was found to be an effective and easy-to-implement environmental burden reduction strategy. Results showed significant potential of autonomous mass-mobility systems to reduce environmental footprint of urban traffic, provided adequate mode-shift can be achieved. The study showed utility of microsimulations for energy and emissions assessment, it linked bus network performance assessment with environmental policies and provided empirical models for headway and service frequency comparisons at vehicle levels. The developed traffic fleet operation prediction methodology for long-term policy implications and tracking models for accurate yearly simulation of real-world vehicle operation profiles are applicable for other sustainability-oriented urban traffic management studies.

AB This paper investigates the robust H infinity path-tracking control problem of network-based autonomous vehicles (AVs) with delay and packet dropout. Generally, both network-induced delay and packet dropout bring negative effects on the system stability and performance. A robust H infinity control scheme is proposed to realize the desired path tracking and lateral stability. The closed-loop system is asymptotically stable with the prescribed H infinity disturbance attention level if there exist some matrices satisfying certain linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions. Furthermore, the proposed controller is robust to the parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

There is currently a great deal of interest in employing unmanned and autonomous vehicles in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations. Although this paper addresses issues common to all mobile sensor networks, the applications presented are typically associated with autonomous vehicles. We focus specifically on three high-level areas: 1. mission definition languages that allow human users to compose missions defined in terms of tasks, 2. communication-addressing degradation and loss and relationship to underlying system architecture design, and 3. task allocation among the assets.

Microcontrollers are low resource platforms not normally associated with GAs, which are typically resource intensive. This implementation will add to a suite of tools, based on different soft computing techniques, which will solve a range of optimization and decision-making problems that are essential in order for an autonomous guided vehicle (AGV) to carry out complex and highly involved tasks. Two examples are presented: path planning and the T-sequencing problem to demonstrate that the GA on an 8051 microcontroller is capable of carrying out necessary optimization and decision-making for AGVs.

AB This paper introduces a fixed-time adaptive path-following cooperative control approach for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs), aimed at improving navigation accuracy and safety in practical scenarios. The scheme ensures that ASVs accurately follow the reference path during navigation while satisfying position and heading angle constraints. To address the position constraint challenge, an adapted version of the universal barrier Lyapunov function is employed for path-dependent constraint function. Furthermore, a novel form of path dependent constraint function is introduced, relying on path parameters instead of direct time variables. A new adaptive backstepping technique is also developed to tackle fixed-time convergence issues, mitigate the complexity surge in controller design, and account for the model's uncertain dynamics. The study demonstrates that this control scheme enables the ASV's position and heading errors to converge near the equilibrium point at a fixed time rate while consistently satisfying path-dependent constraints. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is further verified through simulation and experimental studies.

AB This paper solves the problem of detecting violations of predicates over distributed continuous-time and continuous-valued signals in cyber-physical systems (CPS). CPS often operate in a safety-critical context, where their correctness is crucially important. Large CPS that consist of many autonomous and communicating components distributed across a geographical area must maintain global correctness and safety. We assume a partially synchronous setting, where a clock synchronization algorithm guarantees a bound on clock drifts among all signals. We introduce a novel retiming method that allows reasoning about the correctness of predicates among continuous-time signals that do not share a global view of time. The resulting problem is encoded as an SMT problem and we introduce techniques to solve the SMT encoding efficiently. Leveraging simple knowledge of physical dynamics allows further runtime reductions. We fully implement our approach on three distributed CPS applications: monitoring of a network of autonomous ground vehicles, a network of aerial vehicles, and a water distribution system. The results show that in some cases it is even possible to monitor a distributed CPS sufficiently fast for online deployment on fleets of autonomous vehicles.

AB Hydrodynamics plays a significant role in the underwater motions, environmental disturbances, and kinematic characteristics of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). However, the added mass coefficient has typically not been considered in analyzing the underwater motions of AUVs. Here is report the combustion actuated autonomous underwater vehicles (CA-AUVs). The high-acceleration motions (reaching & SIM; 103 ms -2 in 8.9 ms) of the CA-AUVs are analyzed by simultaneously considering the added mass and drag coefficients. The drag co-efficient is analyzed by investigating a steady computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model whilst analyzing the added mass coefficient by developing an unsteady CFD model. Relations between the coefficients and parame-terized geometric dimensions are obtained and applied to predict the underwater motions, which quantitatively explain the hydrodynamic principle of CA-AUVs underwater motions. Hydrodynamic optimizations are con-ducted with the added mass and drag coefficients to further investigate the influences of the structural design on the CA-AUVs kinematic performances. The research findings provide useful information on the hydrodynamic mechanisms and optimizations of the high-acceleration underwater motions.

AB Autonomous vehicle safety driving requires many vision tasks, such as road segmentation, lane mark detection, and vehicle recognition by frontal cameras. However, all these tasks can suffer due to drastic changes of weather and illumination. To make vision a more robust function in driving, as it is for human drivers, this study models a spectrum of weather and illuminations visible in road environments. We implement big-data mining on naturalistic driving videos through four seasons to understand the influence of weather and illumination. Weather sensitive regions are sampled as image features to describe the illumination models qualitatively and quantitatively. To understand how many distinct weather and illumination types exist for vision tasks, clustering is performed by unsupervised learning on all video samples. Typical views of a spectrum of weather and illumination conditions are generated using K-means clustering of feature distributions; we also find a stable number of clusters. The learned data are used to classify a driving view into one illumination type for guiding the road perception modules in autonomous driving. We further explore the sparse coding of vehicle views under various weather and illuminations.

AB This paper introduces the novel idea of using human social norms and human emotions to improve the collision avoidance of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). Until now, the literature has been concerned with theoretical debates regarding ethical issues connected to AVs, while no practical steps have yet been undertaken. This paper introduces the concept of an artificial society of AVs with different personalities and with social norms coded into their autopilot so that they act like well-behaved drivers. For proof of concept, the standard agent modelling tool Netlogo is utilized to simulate the artificial society of AVs. Furthermore, comparisons are made with random walk-based non-social-based collision avoidance techniques. Extensive testing has been carried out using the behaviour space tool to determine the performance of the proposed approach regarding the number of collisions. A comparative study undertaken with a random walk method indicates that the proposed approach provides a better option for tailoring the autopilots of future AVs, while also promising to be more socially acceptable and trustworthy regarding safe road travel.

AB The combined problems of path-following tracking control for an under-actuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) on the horizontal plane are addressed in this paper. Given three types of smooth and 2-D desired trajectory including straight line path, curve path and circular path in the horizontal plane, the designed path-following control algorithm uses AUV kinematic and dynamic models with cross-track error method and line of sight to compute the desired orientation and velocities, at the same time it also forces the AUV to tracking the desired three types of path which are specified in advance. Numerical simulation is presented to validate the proposed control approach. Simulation results illustrate the good performance of the control system proposed with tracking errors converge to zero fast and smoothly in exponential form at last, which show that the tracking effect remains good and satisfactory that can provide an effective theoretical guidance and technical support for the control system design of the AUV in future.

AB In a manufacturing environment, material transport plays a key role for the production process efficiency. In Schoeller-Bregenz (SB), a textile manufacturing SME, induction wire guided vehicles performed typical material transports, without the flexibility to adapt transport routes to changes in the production process. To overcome these deficits in the RETRARO project (8) an Autonomous Guided Vehicle (AGV) was designed and tested in the production plant. To adapt to changing production configurations, RETRARO had to provide solutions for the following functionality regarding economical constraints: algorithms for efficient path planning and health monitoring; economic sensor systems to provide navigation and obstacle avoidance functions; Integration of free navigation capabilities with existing wire guidance systems. This paper presents a survey on the AGV system design and details on the implementation of the control system based on: the real time expert system REAKT for path planning and health monitoring; a low cost ultra sonic range detection system using sensor data fusion for navigation and obstacle avoidance.

AB This study aims to solve the issue of the safe navigation of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in an unknown underwater environment. AUV will encounter canyons, rocks, reefs, fish, and underwater vehicles that threaten its safety during underwater navigation. A game-based soft actor-critic (GSAC) path planning method is proposed in this study to improve the adaptive capability of autonomous planning and the reliability of obstacle avoidance in the unknown underwater environment. Considering the influence of the simulation environment, the obstacles in the simulation environment are regarded as agents and play a zero-sum game with the AUV. The zero-sum game problem is solved by improving the strategy of AUV and obstacles, so that the simulation environment evolves intelligently with the AUV path planning strategy. The proposed method increases the complexity and diversity of the simulation environment, enables AUV to train in a variable environment specific to its strategy, and improves the adaptability and convergence speed of AUV in unknown underwater environments. Finally, the Python language is applied to write an unknown underwater simulation environment for the AUV simulation testing. GSAC can guide the AUV to the target point in the unknown underwater environment while avoiding large and small static obstacles, canyons, and small dynamic obstacles. Compared with the soft actor-critic(SAC) and the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm, GSAC has better adaptability and convergence speed in the unknown underwater environment. The experiments verifies that GSAC has faster convergence, better stability, and robustness in unknown underwater environments.

TI Economic Effects of Automated Vehicles
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
AB Connected and fully automated or autonomous vehicles (CAVs) may soon dominate the automotive industry. Once CAVs are sufficiently reliable and affordable, they will penetrate markets and thereby generate economic ripple effects throughout industries. This paper synthesizes and expands on existing analyses of the economic effects of CAVs in the United States across 13 industries and the overall economy. CAVs will soon be central to the automotive industry, with software composing a greater share of vehicle value than previously. The number of vehicles purchased each year may fall because of vehicle sharing, but rising travel distances may increase vehicle sales. The opportunity for heavy-truck drivers to do other work or rest during long drives may lower freight costs and increase capacity. Personal transport may shift toward shared autonomous vehicle fleet use, reducing that of taxis, buses, and other forms of group travel. Fewer collisions and more law-abiding vehicles will lower demand for auto repair, traffic police, medical, insurance, and legal services. CAVs will also lead to new methods for managing travel demand and the repurposing of curbside and off-street parking and will generate major savings from productivity gains during handsfree travel and reduction of pain and suffering costs from crashes. If CAVs eventually capture a large share of the automotive market, they are estimated to have economic impacts of $1.2 trillion or $3,800 per American per year. This paper presents important considerations for CAVs' overall effects and quantifies those impacts.

AB In this paper, an improved maximum correntropy cubature kalman filter(IMCCKF) is proposed to address the measurement outliers in cooperative localization(CL) of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The estimated performance of the maximum correntropy cubature kalman filter(MCCKF) algorithm is affected by the kernel bandwidth(KB). The selection value of the KB cannot be determined only by experience in practical CL of AUVs, which will greatly reduce the practical application value of the MCCKF algorithm. The adaptive factor is constructed by comparing the trace size of innovation matrix and the trace size of quantity prediction error matrix, and the KB in the MCCKF is adjusted online by the adaptive factor. Finally, the validity of the proposed IMCCKF method is verified by the lake test data. The experimental results show that the proposed method has the ability to adjust the KB in real time and quickly obtain the optimal value of the KB, and the IMCCKF algorithm can effectively improve the positioning performance of CL system with measurement outliers.

AB The trajectory tracking of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) is an important research topic. However, in the traditional research into AUV trajectory tracking control, the AUV often follows human-set trajectories without obstacles, and trajectory planning and tracking are separated. Focusing on this separation, a trajectory re-planning controller based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) is designed and added into the trajectory tracking controller to form a new control system. Firstly, an obstacle avoidance function is set up for the design of an MPC trajectory re-planning controller, so that the re-planned trajectory produced by the re-planning controller can avoid obstacles. Then, the tracking controller in the MPC receives the re-planned trajectory and obtains the optimal tracking control law after calculating the object function with a Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) optimisation algorithm. Lastly, in a backstepping algorithm, the speed jump can be sharp while the MPC tracking controller can solve the speed jump problem. Simulation results of different obstacles and trajectories demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed MPC trajectory re-planning tracking control algorithm for AUVs.

AB The path planning for autonomous underwater vehicle in unknown complicated oceanic environment is still a task with challenges up to now. Anovel path planning algorithm is proposed to deal with the above problem based on moving objects' motion parameters predication (OMPP). Rapid random search tree algorithm is presented to divide sonar data into segments to obtain separate objects, and virtual centroid is introduced as the replacement of the object in motion parameters' predication. To predict the motion parameters of moving object including velocity and heading angles, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system is adopted. Then, the OMPP algorithm is executed to plan an optimal path, where particle swarm optimization is used to produce temporary waypoints for obstacle avoidance, and a smooth path to destination is automatically produced under the guiding of temporary waypoints and destination. Finally, simulations are conducted in MATLAB soft environment, the results show that the OMPP algorithm is feasible, and the path planned by this algorithm is optimal comparing with other two algorithms.

AB In this paper, for the over-actuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) system, a novel tracking controller with thruster fault accommodation is proposed. Firstly, a cascaded control method is proposed for AUV robust tracking control. Then, we deal with the tracking control problem when one or more thrusters are completely or partly malfunctioning. Different control strategies are used to reallocate the thruster forces. For the cases that thrusters are partly malfunctioning, a weighted pseudo-inverse is firstly used to generate the normalised thruster forces. When the normalised thruster forces are out of maximum limits, the Quantum-behaviour Particle Swarm Optimisation (QPSO) is used for the restricted usage of the faulty thruster and to find the solution of the control reallocation problem within the limits. Compared with the weighted pseudo-inverse method, the QPSO algorithm does not need truncation or scaling to ensure the feasibility of the solution due to its particle search in the feasible solution space. The proposed controller is implemented in order to evaluate its performance in different faulty situations and its efficiency is demonstrated through simulation results.

ID MULTIROBOT SYSTEMS
AB This paper describes perception and planning systems of an autonomous sea surface vehicle (ASV) whose goal is to detect and track other vessels at medium to long ranges and execute responses to determine whether the vessel is adversarial. The jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has developed a tightly integrated system called CARACaS (Control Architecture for Robotic Agent Command and Sensing) that blends the sensing, planning, and behavior autonomy necessary for such missions. Two patrol scenarios are addressed here: one in which the ASV patrols a large harbor region and checks for vessels near a fixed asset on each pass and one in which the ASV circles a fixed asset and intercepts approaching vessels. This paper focuses on the ASV's central perception and situation awareness system, dubbed Surface Autonomous Visual Analysis and Tracking (SAVAnT), which receives images from an omnidirectional camera head, identifies objects of interest in these images, and probabilistically tracks the objects' presence over time, even as they may exist outside of the vehicle's sensor range. The integrated CARACaS/SAVAnT system has been implemented on U.S. Navy experimental ASVs and tested in on-water field demonstrations. (c) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB In response to the critical need for autonomous navigation capabilities of underwater vehicles independent of satellites, this paper studies a novel navigation and control method based on underwater polarization patterns. We propose an underwater course angle measurement algorithm and develop underwater polarization detection equipment. By establishing the automatic control model of an ROV (Remote Operated Vehicle) with polarization information, we develop a strapdown navigation method combining polarization and inertial information. We verify the feasibility of angle measurement based on polarization in the water tank. The measurement accuracy of polarization azimuth is less than 0.69 degrees. Next, we conduct ROV navigation at different water depths in a real underwater environment. At a depth of 5 m, the MSE (Mean Square Error) and SD (Standard Deviation) of angle error are 16.57 degrees and 4.07 degrees, respectively. Underwater navigation accuracy of traveling 100 m is better than 5 m within a depth of 5 m. Key technologies such as underwater polarization detection, multi-source information fusion, and the ROV automatic control model with polarization have been broken through. This method can effectively improve ROV underwater work efficiency and accuracy.

AB Autonomous maneuvering flight is essential for civil applications of unmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs). Yet it remains a challenge due to the coupled translational and rotational dynamics and the complexity of the movements. This paper proposes a brain-inspired architecture for autonomous maneuvering flight of miniature UAVs. In designing such system, several key issues will be addressed: maneuver controller design, online maneuver decision making, and command generation. First, a modeling method based on dual quaternion is proposed to describe maneuvering flight. Then, an incremental flight control method in 6-DOF is introduced. Furthermore, a novel dual quaternion-based dynamic maneuvering primitive(DQ-DMP) is proposed to learn the trajectories performed by human pilots. Finally, a decision-making method based on a spiking neural network and Actor-Critic network is provided for the choice of maneuvering primitives. The hardware-in-the-loop simulation and outdoor flight test show that the architecture can learn, repeat and generalize the maneuvers. Various aerobatic maneuvers can be performed by the fixed-wing UAV after several demonstrations.

AB Motion control algorithms in the presence of pedestrians are critical for the development of safe and reliable Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). Traditional motion control algorithms rely on manually designed decision-making policies which neglect the mutual interactions between AVs and pedestrians. On the other hand, recent advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning allow for the automatic learning of policies without manual designs. To tackle the problem of decision-making in the presence of pedestrians, the authors introduce a framework based on Social Value Orientation and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) that is capable of generating decision-making policies with different driving styles. The policy is trained using state-of-the-art DRL algorithms in a simulated environment. A novel computationally-efficient pedestrian model that is suitable for DRL training is also introduced. We perform experiments to validate our framework and we conduct a comparative analysis of the policies obtained with two different model-free Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms. Simulations results show how the developed model exhibits natural driving behaviours, such as short-stopping, to facilitate the pedestrian's crossing.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) networks are vulnerable to security attacks targeting data integrity and service availability. To successfully operate in emerging automated highway systems (AHS), securing communications among the AVs and with the transportation infrastructure is paramount. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is the foremost defense artifact against malicious AV activities. However, individual IDS on board of the AV may not be sufficient enough against diverse and increasingly emerging new threats. In addition, not all security vendors synchronize their update of new IDS security features. Therefore, the collaboration among individual IDSs of AVs enables the vehicles to benefit from the collective knowledge and information of their neighbors and achieve more accurate intrusion detection. This paper presents a hierarchical framework for a Collaborative Intrusion Detection Network (CIDN) that allows the AV platoons to share detection knowledge based on trust and increase the accuracy of their individual IDS. The proposed CIDN involves intra-platoon and inter-platoon collaborations to improve scalability. The experimental results show that collaborative IDSs yield higher accuracy than individual IDSs in detecting misbehaviors in AV networks while achieving scalability.

   DESIGN
AB When the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) traces the trajectory under complex hydrological conditions, the real-time performance of system is slow and the accuracy of tracking is poor. To solve this problem, an adaptive predictive control method based on Laguerre function is designed in this paper. This method contains two parts: one is the adaptive MPC module which is used to track the trajectory accurately; the other is the Laguerre function module which is applied to reduce computations significantly. In the adaptive MPC module, the recursive least squares algorithm is introduced to identify the model parameters of the system to improve the accuracy and the robustness. However, this method may cause a great increase in computation when AUV works in the complex environment. Therefore, in Laguerre function, one reconstruction of the controller input variables is introduced to reduce the matrix order of the objective function. The simulation results show that the designed method has a good performance in the respects of the dynamic, the anti-interference and the robustness when AUV tracks the trajectory with the less amount of calculation.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Inferring the intended actions of road-sharing users with autonomous ground vehicles in particularly vulnerable ones like cyclists is considered one of the tough tasks facing the wide-spread deployment of autonomous ground vehicles. One of the main reasons for that is the scarcity of the available datasets for that task due to the difficulty in obtaining those datasets in real environments. In this work, we first propose a pipeline that can synthetically produce 3D LiDAR data of cyclists hand-signalling a set of intended actions that are commonly done in real environments. Given the synthetically-produced labelled 3D LiDAR data sequences, we trained a framework that can simultaneously detect, track and give predictions about the intended actions of multi-cyclists in the scene on time. The proposed framework was evaluated using both synthetic and real data from a physical 3D LiDAR sensor. Our proposed framework has scored competitive and robust results in both synthetic and real environments with 88% in F-1 measure with higher frame per second rate (12.9 FPS) than the 3D LiDAR sensor frame rate (10 Hz).

AB To further enhance the safety, energy efficiency, and riding comfort of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs), an overactuated AGV (OA-AGV) driven by four in-wheel motors and two steering motors is developed. Benefitted from the overactuation, three main advantages of the OA-AGV over conventional AGVs are demonstrated in this article. First, the lateral stability of the OA-AGV can be significantly enhanced with the additional rear wheel steering system. Second, the energy consumptions of the OA-AGV are reduced for lateral maneuvers compared with a conventional AGV with only front wheel steering. Third, the riding comfort of the OA-AGV, described by the lateral acceleration and jerk in lateral maneuvers, can also be improved. To evaluate and validate these three advantages of the OA-AGV, both simulation and experimental results are demonstrated and discussed. The conclusion is that the redundant actuators, together with sensor fusions and path planning strategies, can significantly enhance the capabilities and potentials of AGVs on safety, energy efficiency, and riding comfort.

DE Autonomous underwater vehicle; Synthetic aperture sonar; Multipath
   rejection; Fast imaging; Motion compensation
AB Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) has attracted intensive attention for its property of high spatial resolution independent of range. However, the SAS performance in shallow water can be severely degraded due to multipath interferences. This paper presents a wideband low-frequency synthetic aperture sonar system carried by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). With a small-size array of vertically displaced hydrophones, the so-called steered robust Capon beamforming technique is utilized to separate the direct echo from the multipath signals. The sector factorized back-projection (SFBP) algorithm developed for fast SAS image creation has been improved to be suited to arbitrary synthetic apertures. And the motion trajectory estimated by the AUV navigation system can be directly utilized for synthesizing a large aperture. The effects of Doppler mismatch on the SAS image can be neglected after motion-model mismatch compensation is carried out. The prototype SAS system underwent a number of lake tests and data processing results verified the performance improvements on output image quality in terms of both ghost target removal and contrast enhancement.

DE horizontal directional drilling method; autonomous land vehicles; radio
   directional finding system; fuzzy logic controller
AB This article discusses the improvement in the horizontal directional drilling method (HDD) by using an autonomous land vehicle (ALV) with a radio directional finding (RDF) system. The ALV with an RDF system carrying a receiver can locate a moving or static underground drill head and track it. Not limited to a pre-determined track or path, the ALV system utilizes its on board RDF system instantaneously to seek and to track a moving or static drill head. Compared to conventional systems, the system reduces the number of operators, minimizes labor costs, prevents accidents. and enhances the degree of automation.
   The design of the RDF system and how to locate a target are considered in this article. To overcome the difficulty in obtaining the precise dynamic model of the ALV with the RDF system, a "fuzzy logic controller" is designed to control such a system and make the system capable of tracking a target. Experimental results verify that such an RDF ALV system can track a moving or static target. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A relationship was established between the steering angle and the turning radius of an autonomous four-wheeled, rice transplanter travelling in a paddy field. The transplanter was operated at three different forward speeds in circular paths in a flooded paddy field. The vehicle position was measured using real-time kinematic global positioning system.
   Measured values were compared with theoretical values of turning radii obtained by a geometrical vehicle model. The predicted turning radius, however, was much smaller than the measured turning radius, the difference being attributed to poor lateral support of the tyres when operating on the soft top soil of a flooded paddy field.

AB In this article, we address the simultaneous estimation problem of the lateral speed, the steering input, and the effective engine torque, which play a fundamental role in vehicle handling, stability control, and fault diagnosis of autonomous ground vehicles. Due to the involved longitudinal-lateral coupling dynamics and the presence of unknown inputs (UIs), a new nonlinear observer design technique is proposed to guarantee the asymptotic estimation performance. To this end, we make use of a specific Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy representation with nonlinear consequents to exactly model the nonlinear vehicle dynamics within a compact set of the vehicle state. This TS fuzzy modeling not only allows reducing significantly the real-time computational effort in estimating the vehicle variables but also enables an effective way to deal with unmeasured nonlinearities. Moreover, via a generalized Luenberger observer structure, the UI decoupling can be achieved without requiring a priori UI information. Using Lyapunov stability arguments, the UI observer design is reformulated as an optimization problem under linear matrix inequalities, which can be effectively solved with standard numerical solvers. The effectiveness of the proposed TS fuzzy UI observer design is demonstrated with real-time hardware-in-the-loop experiments.

AB Since automated vehicles (AVs) were first introduced in public imagination, the stated goal of developers has been to develop vehicles that would eventually operate in diverse contexts like any other vehicle. To understand what this entails in real-life traffic, data regarding interactions were extracted from three separately run trials of automated shuttles in low-speed contexts with human road users in Denmark (2018-21) using a qualitative metasynthesis approach. The underlying data consists of field observations, interviews with road users, geolocalized event registrations, video tracking data, and responses to open-ended surveys. The synthesis suggests that 1) dynamic negotiation of space and timing, 2) handling of situational and traffic system ambiguity, and 3) human road user learning, go beyond what should simply be attributed to a transitory immaturity of the technology. Road users expect other road users to engage in a deeply social negotiation of space and timing. When AVs fail to negotiate, traffic flow is interrupted, and road users express confusion and impatience, until they develop strategies to obstruct or move around the shuttles. We discuss implications on planning in low-car environments.

TI Autonomous Vehicle-Intersection Coordination Method in a Connected
   Vehicle Environment
SO IEEE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
AB In response to the need for developing coordinated schemes of autonomous vehicles (AVs) at an intersection. This paper presents a novel coordination method for intersection management in a connected vehicle environment. The road network is divided into three logical sections, namely, buffer area, core area and free driving area. In addition, a buffer-assignment mechanism is developed to cooperatively assign a specific crossing span for an individual AV and guide each AV to adjust its entry time and corresponding speed in the core area. A set-projection algorithm and a three-segment linear speed profile are employed to control the trajectories of the AVs in the buffer area. Furthermore, the assignment failure handling process and the crossing rule for human-driven vehicles are advanced to enhance the practicability and reliability of the buffer-assignment mechanism. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by simulating various traffic conditions on an actual urban network. The simulation experiments and sensitivity analyses demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly reduce 24.2%-77.1% of travel delays, decrease almost 99% of number of stops and improve the sustainability of the traffic system by saving 22.1%-52% of fuel consumption.

AB Lane detection (LD) under different illumination conditions is a vital part of lane departure warning system and vehicle localization which are current trends in the future smart cities. Recently, vision-based methods are proposed to detect lane markers in different road situations including abnormal marker cases. However, an inclusive framework for driverless cars has not been introduced yet. In this work, a novel LD and tracking method is proposed for the autonomous vehicle in the IoT-based framework (IBF). The IBF consists of three modules which are vehicle board (VB), cloud module (CM), and the vehicle remote controller. The LD and tracking are carried out initially by the VB, and then, in case of any failure, the whole set of data is passed to CM to be processed and the results are sent to the VB to perform the appropriate action. If the CM detects a lane departure, then the autonomous vehicle is driven remotely and the VB would be restarted. In addition to the proposed framework, an illumination invariance method is presented to detect lane markers under different light conditions. The simulation results with real-life data demonstrate lane-keeping rates of 95.3% and 95.2% in tunnels and on highways, respectively. The approximate processing time of the proposed method is 31 ms/frame which fulfills the real-time requirements.

AB Autonomous bottom mine neutralization systems have a challenging task of mine reacquisition and navigation in the demanding underwater environment. Even after mine reacquisition, the neutralization payload has to be autonomously deployed near the mine, and before any action the verification (classification) of the existence of a mine has to be determined. The mine intervention vehicle can be an expendable (self-destroyed during the mine neutralization) or a vehicle that deploys the neutralization payload and it is retrieved at the end of the mission. Currently the systems developed by the research community are capable of remotely navigating a mine intervention underwater vehicle in the vicinity of the mine by using remote sonar aided navigation from a master vehicle. However, the task of successfully navigating the vehicle that carries the neutralization payload near the bottom and around the mine remains a challenge due to sea bottom clutter and the target signature interfering with the sonar detection. We seek a solution by introducing navigation via visual processing near the mine location. Using an onboard camera, the relative distance to the mine-like object can be estimated. This will improve the overall vehicle navigation and rate of successful payload delivery close to the mine. The paper presents the current navigation system of the mine intervention underwater vehicle and the newly developed visual processing for relative position estimation.

AB Ocean currents, mechanical collisions and electronic damage can cause faults in an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), including sensors and thrusters. For such problems, this paper designs a fault-tolerant controller that is independent of the results of the fault diagnosis. An adaptive reaching law is developed based on sliding mode control to shorten convergence times. For the chattering phenomenon, a weighted hyperbolic tangent function is adopted instead of the traditional sign function in sliding mode control. Simulations are carried out when thruster and sensor fail under the condition of ocean current disturbance, model uncertainty and sensor noise. Comparative simulation results show that the proposed method can accelerate the convergence speed of the state point and improve the trajectory tracking effect of the AUV. Consequently, the effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed.

TI Greenhouse Gas Emission Impact of Autonomous Vehicle Introduction in an
   Urban Network
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB This study attempts to quantify the change in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions resulting from autonomous vehicle (AV) introduction in a congested urban network. An integrated traffic microsimulation and emission model is introduced, described, and used to estimate emissions for different AV penetration scenarios ranging from 0% to 100%. AVs show potential to reduce total CO2 emissions at a network scale, approaching 4% reduction at full autonomy, assuming the same fuel technology in AV as in today's fleet. Furthermore, it is found that this reduction is sensitive to the penetration ratio of AVs, and is greatest at full AV penetration; AV penetration may generate greater total vehicular CO2 emissions than 0% AV penetration does, contrary to popular belief. This may be because of the heterogeneity in a mixed traffic environment of human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and AVs, as well as the complex interaction between HDVs and AVs that is not yet fully understood.

AB This paper presents a reanalysis of two of the models and one of the vehicles used in a previously published paper "Fuel Economy Testing of Autonomous Vehicles" (Mersky and Samaras, 2016). In that paper, a method for testing the fuel economy of automated vehicle features was proposed and tested, via simulation. In that paper, for the rule-sets and vehicles tested, it was estimated that fuel economy could change from -3 to + 10%; this has been amended to -3 to + 5%. In the prior paper, it was concluded that the VelocityACC control method occasionally improved fuel economy, that HeadwayACC generally performed worse than VelocityACC and that PlannedACC performed best. HeadwayACC and VelocityACC were also found to be insensitive to target headway. In this paper implementation errors were corrected in VelocityACC and HeadwayACC. Additionally, of the four vehicles tested, the 2011 Toyota Camry was rerun with four cylinders, rather than six. Under the assumptions used, VelocityACC has been found to never increase fuel economy, when following base EPA cycles. HeadwayACC has been found to always increase fuel economy and perform better than PlannedACC, when following base EPA cycles. Both HeadwayACC and VelocityACC were found to be sensitive to desired headway, improving fuel economy as desired headway increased. These amended results serve to further reinforce the importance of testing automated vehicle feature fuel economy as was concluded in the previous paper.

The effectiveness of the anti-interference capability of the LiDAR is verified by ranging relative error (RE). The result shows that the RE of range measuring is minor than +/- 0.9%. It demonstrated that the proposed LiDAR in the letter provides a reproducible and reliable way to realize ranging detection. In addition, the experiment results testify that the system has an excellent anti-interference capability with other interference of LiDARs.

AB This paper deals with the trajectory generation problem faced by an autonomous vehicle in moving traffic. Being given the predicted motion of the traffic flow, the proposed semi-reactive planning strategy realizes all required long-term maneuver tasks (lane-changing, merging, distance-keeping, velocity-keeping, precise stopping, etc.) while providing short-term collision avoidance. The key to comfortable, human-like as well as physically feasible trajectories is the combined optimization of the lateral and longitudinal movements in street-relative coordinates with carefully chosen cost functionals and terminal state sets (manifolds). The performance of the approach is demonstrated in simulated traffic scenarios.

AB Existing lane-changing (LC) algorithms in general prioritize self-interest above the benefits of others. We argue that an autonomous vehicle should be socially responsible during lane change without causing excessive impact on its surroundings. Thus, in this paper, we propose an LC algorithm that could generate a trajectory to optimize the overall benefits of the subject vehicle and others in its vicinity. This is mainly achieved by introducing Longitudinal Control Model to characterize the driving behaviors of neighboring vehicles, and drivers' needs such as comfort, efficiency, and safety are simultaneously satisfied. We combine macro and micro comparative analysis to evaluate the advantage of our approach against existing algorithms. Our findings reveal that the vehicle controlled by our algorithm is capable of safely performing the LC maneuver while causing the least amount of impact. This is reflected in the decrease in total cost of all vehicles and the increase in traffic speed and throughput in its vicinity. In addition, we use HighD dataset for further validation and demonstrate that our algorithm is practically sound. Application of this research can lead to improved autonomous driving technology.

AB Automation in road public transportation has been facilitated by the emergence of infocommunication and vehicle technologies. The widely accepted definitions of automation level focus solely on the driving aspects of vehicles. However, automation covers even more fields: service planning and management, vehicle and traffic control, and passenger-handling functions. Therefore, the main outcome of this paper is a method to be applied for the handling of complex automation levels, which gives a more comprehensive assessment of new transport technologies and mobility services. Functions and function categories are all described. The paper defines four levels of automation, with a detailed description of each level and each function. The method can be applied efficiently to the analysis and comparison of services, thereby highlighting possible fields of development. Mobility services can be described by values only in a general and simplified manner. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, existing services are assessed. Dial-a-bus service, taxi, ride sourcing, and car sharing are evaluated using the novel method, which provides an objective and comprehensive comparison of these services.

AB Autonomous driving technology is advancing rapidly, and heterogeneous traffic flow consisting of intelligent controlled vehicles (ICV) and human driving vehicles (HDV) is expected to become the dominant mode on roads. In this study, three driving styles of HDV were analyzed using actual data sets, and the Gipps rule was introduced to establish safety conditions for following and lane-changing rules. A two-lane heterogeneous traffic flow cellular automata model was proposed and simulated using Matlab. According to the simulation results, the impact of ICV penetration rate on traffic capacity is significant, exhibiting a 23.4% to 62.5% increase compared to homogeneous HDV flow within the range of 0.2 to 0.8 ICV penetration rate. Homogeneous ICV flow is about 1.5 times higher than homogeneous HDV flow. Moreover, as the ICV penetration rate increases, there is a gradual decrease in both the lane-changing frequency and congestion level. These findings provide valuable insights into the influence of ICV mixed on traffic flow performance and offer a theoretical basis for managing and controlling heterogeneous traffic flow.

AB This paper studies the low-speed manoeuvring problem for autono-mous ground vehicles operating in complex static environments. Making use of the intrinsic property of a fluid to naturally find its way to an outflow destination, a novel guidance method is proposed. In this approach, a reference flow field is calculated numerically through Computational Fluid Dynamics, based on which both the reference path topology and the steering reference to achieve the path are derived in a single process. Steering control considers three constraints: obstacle and boundary avoidance, rigidity of the vehicle, plus the non-holonomic velocity constraints due to the steering system. The influences of the parameters used during the flow field simulation and the control algorithm are discussed through numerical cases. A divergency field is defined to evaluate the quality of the flow field in guiding the vehicle. This is used to identify any problematic branching features of the flow, and control is adapted in the neighbourhood of such branching features to resolve possible ambiguities in the control reference. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in finding smooth and feasible motion paths, even in complex environments.

AB This paper focuses on the design of an automatic steering controller that has been implemented on an 18.3-m articulated bus for revenue service. Compared with the typical environment for autonomous cars, the narrow and curving bus lane and the tight S-shape docking curves require a steering controller to consistently provide high accuracy with ride comfort. While analyzing the data of drivers steering through a double lane change course, we discovered and validated that driver's steering rate is proportional to a specific vehicle angle error. Subsequent analysis showed that drivers in effect execute a naturally robust controller that allows high-gain corrections and is insensitive to variations in vehicle dynamics and speeds. This paper presents the first adaptation of this driver's steering mechanism to a real-world challenging application. The resultant system achieved all performance requirements, and the revenue service at Eugene, OR, USA, started in June 2013. Moreover, the simple control structure greatly facilitated the design of fault detection, degraded control, and control redundancy.

AB As traffic lanes and on-street parking spots can potentially be downsized with the introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs), the possibility of additional spare road space becoming available arises in future urban streets. While discussions on converting the leftover space into pedestrian-friendly alternatives exist, allocating that limited space to which alternative is foreseen to be another practical issue shared in both urban and transportation planning. However, evidence-based guidance on the issue provided from the actual verification on whether or to what extent the proposed alternatives may have an effect seems to be absent. Therefore, with an emphasis on pedestrian safety, this study focused on the "median strip" alternative as a first example and, through a VR simulation experiment aimed at empirically examining its suggested role on enhancing street crossing safety and further exploring its possible influence on pedestrians' trust toward autonomous driving. With 99 participants, perceived safety (individual assessments of safety), performance-based safety (crossing success/abandonment and collision occurrence), and trust were either questioned or recorded for nine scenarios with varying crossing conditions. A combination of multilevel models and cross-tabulation results indicate that medians seem especially significant in ensuring the performance-based safety results of pedestrians even when AVs are driving at high speeds or with smaller gaps, thus suggesting it a win-win option for both. Insights and implications on the role and management of medians in future streets are further provided.

AB Maneuvers of a nonholonomic vehicle in a structured dynamic environment are considered. The paper focuses on motion generation and control methods to autonomously perform lane following/changing and parallel parking maneuvers. Lane following/changing involves the tracking of a nominal trajectory in the traffic lane, and the generation and tracking of local lane-changing trajectories, for instance, for obstacle avoidance. Parallel parking involves a controlled sequence of motions, in order to localize a sufficient parking space, obtain a convenient start location for the vehicle and perform a parallel parking maneuver. The methods developed are tested on an automatic electric vehicle.

TI ADCP Bias and Stokes Drift in AUV-Based Velocity Measurements
SO JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE
AB A theoretical model is developed to describe how autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-based current measurements are influenced by a surface wave field. The model quantifies a quasi-Lagrangian, wave-induced velocity bias as a function of the local wave conditions, and the vehicle's depth and velocity using a first-order expansion of the linear wave solution. The theoretical bias is verified via field experiments carried out off the coast of Oahu, Hawaii. Spatially averaged along-and cross-track AUV velocity measurements are calculated over one effective wavelength and compared with time-averaged, fixed ADCP measurements in a range of wave and current conditions. The wave-induced bias is calculated using wave directional spectra derived from fixed ADCP data. Ensemble-averaged velocity differences (<Delta V > = < V-AUV - V-ADCP >) confirm the presence of the wave-induced bias O(1-5) cm s(-1) and reveal an additional bias in the direction of the vehicle motion O(1) cm s(-1). The analysis considers velocity measurements made using a Remote Environmental Monitoring Units (REMUS) 100 AUV, but the content applies to any small AUV (vehicle size << wavelength) immersed in a wave field.

AB This paper proposes a robust control framework for lane-keeping and obstacle avoidance of semiautonomous ground vehicles. It presents a systematic way of enforcing robustness during the MPC design stage. A robust nonlinear model predictive controller (RNMPC) is used to help the driver navigating the vehicle in order to avoid obstacles and track the road centre line. A force-input nonlinear bicycle vehicle model is developed and used in the RNMPC control design. A robust invariant set is used in the RNMPC design to guarantee that state and input constraints are satisfied in the presence of disturbances and model error. Simulations and experiments on a vehicle show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

AB This paper deals with a novel direct state-dependent Riccati equation (SDRE) controller designed for trajectory tracking of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the presence of parameter perturbation. Despite the traditional SDRE regulator control, the proposed closed-loop SDRE controller design chiefly consists of two parts. First, by selecting a virtual reference point in front of the AUV system as the tracking output, the error variable control model in the earth-fixed reference frame is described. Second, the position errors are driven to the origin by introducing an integral model of first-order fed by the tracking error. The main advantage of the proposed control scheme is that the controller has a unified structure. Moreover, the algorithm is able to provide robustness with parameter perturbation because of its intrinsic robustness capability. Within the SDRE framework, the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop tracking system is also guaranteed. The robustness and effectiveness of the proposed methodology are verified by performing simulation experiments on an underactuated AUV.

AB Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are a promising technology that is ready to be deployed in the near future to improve the traffic efficiency and safety as well as environment. Extensive studies have been done to investigate the potential performance of CAVs on freeways, at roundabouts, and conventional intersections. Nevertheless, innovative intersections, as an important component of today's transportation infrastructure, have been seldom investigated in relation to the performance of CAVs. Hence, this research is designed to examine how CAV technologies can influence the performance of a superstreet, one of the popular innovative intersection designs. In this research, the car-following model, platooning, trajectory planning, and adaptive signal control are specified for CAVs and signal controllers in a superstreet. An equivalent conventional intersection with the same lane configurations is also constructed in the simulation environment to make a fair comparison and gain important insights. More importantly, the findings from this research may provide references for studies on other innovative intersections which share similar design characteristics.

This big flaw has made it challenging to fully adopt the object detection applications in important products and essential industries such as autonomous vehicles. While the field of adversarial robustness has witnessed a great deal of achievement in building sophisticated methods of attack and defense, the majority of the work has been focused on the task of image classification due to its simplicity in theory and practice. In this paper, we provide an up-to-date survey of recent advancements in the field of adversarial robustness for object detection. We review the prominent attack and defense mechanisms presented in the research community and provide discussions and insights on their strengths and weaknesses. In addition, we review the recent literature on adversarial robustness for applications related to autonomous vehicles, as a critical aspect of this high-impact emerging industry, in which the robustness of models is of vital importance.

AB The absence of global positioning system (GPS) signals and the influence of ocean currents are two of the main challenges facing the autonomy of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). This paper proposes an acoustic localization-based tracking control method for AUVs. Particularly, three buoys that emit acoustic signals periodically are deployed over the surface. Times of arrivals of these acoustic signals at the AUV are then obtained and used to calculate an estimated position of the AUV. Moreover, the uncertainties involved in the localization and ocean currents are handled together in the framework of the extended Kalman filter. To deal with system physical constraints, model predictive control relying on online repetitive optimizations is applied in the tracking controller design. Furthermore, due to the different sampling times between localization and control, the dead-reckoning technique is utilized considering detailed AUV dynamics. To avoid using the highly nonlinear and complicated AUV dynamics in the online optimizations, successive linearizations are employed to achieve a trade-off between computational complexity and control performance. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms are effective and can achieve the AUV tracking control goals.

AB This paper investigates the formation-containment (FC) control problem of networked underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in three-dimensional space. The multi-AUV system under consideration has directed topology, heterogeneous uncertain dynamics and system constraints. To achieve the leaders' formation and followers' containment, a two-layer control framework is adopted to decouple the FC problem into two subproblems: reference trajectory generation and trajectory tracking. In the upper layer, a distributed estimator is designed for each AUV to generate a reference trajectory in accordance with the FC objective. Subsequently, a model-free trajectory tracking strategy is developed in the lower layer, where adaptive neural networks combined with an auxiliary compensator are involved not only to approximate the heterogeneous system dynamics, but also to preserve the velocity and input constraints simultaneously. Input-to-state stability is employed to analyze the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, comparative simulations are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed two-layer control protocol.

AB Fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) must meet stringent real-time performance and safety-criticality constraints of multiple applications simultaneously in highly dynamic environmental conditions. To enable such a system, carefully selected accelerators and general-purpose cores on Systems-on-Chips (SoCs) are required. However, schedulers that are agnostic to this heterogeneity lead to inefficient utilization of hardware resources and increase the time to complete the AV's mission. As a solution, our letter proposes a heterogeneity-aware, multi-level scheduler called HetSched. HetSched leverages run-time information about the underlying heterogeneous SoC, along with the applications' real-time constraints to improve an AV's mission time. Our evaluation demonstrates a reduction in mission time of 2.0-4.8x, when compared against state-of-the-art (SOTA) schedulers. Furthermore, when used as part of an SoC design space exploration loop, in comparison to the SOTA schedulers, HetSched reduces the number of accelerators required by an SoC to safely complete the AV's mission by 1.9x on average.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are widely believed to be good for improving transportation safety and efficiency. However, recent fatal accidents by some of their prototypes remind us that there are no operationalizable and quantitative safe driving strategies available for an AV in a wide range of situations to avoid collisions. In contrast with many recent studies that focused on ethical considerations when AVs are facing unavoidable harms, we study how to proactively prevent collisions by setting up a set of decision rules for AVs to determine the right-of-way efficiently. Notably, we summarize three essential principles for AVs designing to increase driving safety, and establish a rule-based nine-step communication-decision model to implement them. Our method is constructed by analyzing how human drivers solve potential conflicts. The decision rules are designed to be ambiguity-free and readily computable with the least communication so that human drivers and AVs could easily understand each other in terms of their behaviors and intentions of. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method by comparing it with some alternative approaches.

ID BOUNDED RATIONALITY; RESPONSIBILITY; ATTRIBUTION; PSYCHOLOGY
AB The development of artificial intelligence has led researchers to study the ethical principles that should guide machine behavior. The challenge in building machine morality based on people's moral decisions, however, is accounting for the biases in human moral decision-making. In seven studies, this paper investigates how people's personal perspectives and decision-making modes affect their decisions in the moral dilemmas faced by autonomous vehicles. Moreover, it determines the variations in people's moral decisions that can be attributed to the situational factors of the dilemmas. The reported studies demonstrate that people's moral decisions, regardless of the presented dilemma, are biased by their decision-making mode and personal perspective. Under intuitive moral decisions, participants shift more towards a deontological doctrine by sacrificing the passenger instead of the pedestrian. In addition, once the personal perspective is made salient participants preserve the lives of that perspective, i.e. the passenger shifts towards sacrificing the pedestrian, and vice versa. These biases in people's moral decisions underline the social challenge in the design of a universal moral code for autonomous vehicles. We discuss the implications of our findings and provide directions for future research.

AB Anemonefishes and their host sea anemones are iconic inhabitants of coral reef ecosystems. While studies have documented their abundance in shallow-water reef habitats in parts of the Indo-Pacific, none have examined these species on mesophotic reefs. In this study, we used autonomous underwater vehicle imagery to examine the abundance and diversity of anemones and anemonefishes at Viper Reef and Hydrographers Passage in the central Great Barrier Reef at depths between 50 and 65 m. A total of 37 host sea anemones (31 Entacmaea quadricolor and 6 Heteractis crispa) and 24 anemonefishes (23 Amphiprion akindynos and 1 A. perideraion) were observed. Densities were highest at Viper Reef, with 8.48 E. quadricolor and A. akindynos per 100 m(2) of reef substratum. These results support the hypothesis that mesophotic reefs have many species common to shallow-water coral reefs and that many taxa may occur at depths greater than currently recognised.

AB Purpose - Lane tracking is one of the most important processes for autonomous vehicles because the navigable region usually stands between the lanes, especially in urban environments. A robust lane tracking method is also required for reducing the effect of the noise and the required processing time. The purpose of this paper is to present a new lane tracking method.
   Design/methodology/approach - A new lane tracking method is presented which uses a partitioning technique for obtaining multiresolution Hough transform of the acquired vision data where Hough transform is one of the most popular algorithms for lane detection. After the detection process, for tracking the detected lanes, a hidden Markov model (HMM) based method is proposed.
   Findings - The results of the proposed approach show that the partitioned Hough transformation reduces the effect of noise and provides robust lane tracking. In addition, the acquired lanes are successfully tracked by using the designed HMM.
   Originality/value - This paper provides a fast lane tracking system which can be integrated with an autonomous vehicle or a driver assistance system.

AB Due to the strong nonlinearity, coupling characteristics, external disturbance, and complex driving conditions, it is difficult to establish an accurate mathematical model for the autonomous ground vehicle (AGV). This requires the AGV path following controller to have strong robustness. In this paper, a robust AGV path following control strategy that is based on nonsingular terminal sliding mode (NTSM) and active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is presented. First, the complex path following problem is simplified to a simple yaw angle tracking problem by constructing a desired yaw angle function that satisfies that the displacement deviation of AGV converges to zero when the actual yaw angle approaches the desired yaw angle. Second, an NTSM-ADRC controller is designed for the system, which uses the extended state observer to estimate and compensate the unmodeled dynamics and unknown external perturbations of the system in real time. In order to improve response characteristics of the controller, the nonlinear error feedback control law is designed by combining theNTSMand exponential approximation law. In contrast to the existingwork, the improved controller can use the simple two-degree-of-freedom linear vehicle dynamicmodel to provide good performance in a range of driving conditions. Finally, the CarSim-Simulink simulation results of typical conditions show that the proposed control strategy canmake theAGVfollowthe reference path quickly and accurately while ensuring the stability of the vehicle and has strong robustness.

AB Background and methods This paper addresses, in simulation, energy minimization of an autonomous electric minibus operating in an urban environment. Two different case studies have been considered, each involving a total of 10 different 2?km bus routes and two different average speeds. In the proposed method, the minibus follows an optimized speed profile, generated using a genetic algorithm. Results In the first case study the vehicle was able to reduce its energy consumption by around 7 to 12% relative to a baseline case in which it maintains a constant speed between stops, with short acceleration and deceleration phases. In the second case study, involving mass variation (passengers entering and alighting) it was demonstrated that the number of round trips that can be completed on a single battery charge is increased by around 10% using the proposed method.

AB The emerging autonomous vehicles (AVs) technologies provide a new opportunity to design a better lanechanging trajectory to reduce traffic congestion. The existing research on lane-changing trajectory planning mainly focuses on fitting trajectory curves, and the lane-changing trajectory is not optimized from the perspective of optimal control. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an optimal lane-changing trajectory planning model for AVs. First, the vehicle lane-changing process is modeled as an optimal control problem to minimize fuel consumption. The control variables are acceleration and steering angle. Second, to simplify the optimal control model, the speed and acceleration are decomposed in X and Y directions. The nonlinear constraints of the optimal control model are transformed into linear constraints. Then, we discretize the time of the optimal control model and simplify the problem into nonlinear programming (NLP). Finally, taking the NGSIM database and polynomial trajectory curve as the benchmark, we verify that the optimal lanechanging trajectory can significantly save energy consumption, with an average reduction of 37.52% and 32.48%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that (1) the minimum fuel consumption of lane-changing trajectory corresponds to optimal lane-changing duration and an optimal longitudinal displacement; (2) the more significant the speed difference (i.e., initial speed and final speed) before and after lane-changing, the greater the fuel consumption of lane-changing; (3) the fuel consumption of lane-changing increases with the increase of lateral displacement.

AB Although fully implemented autonomous vehicles (AVs) seem to be on the cusp of reality, standard evaluation and testing procedures still are lacking. This study conducted a preliminary evaluation of the technical feasibility, safety, and reliability of using AV technology, in particular a low-speed, self-driving shuttle known as Olli. The study designed a set of 12 testing scenarios and performed experiments to evaluate the operational capabilities, safety, and reliability of the self-driving shuttle on the University at Buffalo's Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) proving grounds. The scenarios were designed to evaluate the vehicle's performance while simulating the operational scenarios that the shuttle would encounter when deployed in the real world at a medical and educational campus in downtown Buffalo, New York. Preliminary results provide insight into the operational characteristics of the self-driving shuttle; its stopping distance behavior, its ability to detect and safely react to obstacles, conflicts, and other hazards on the road; its car-following behavior, and the impact of inclement weather conditions on performance.

AB In this paper, the target tracking control problem is addressed for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) with a prescribed performance. For this purpose, the range and bearing angles of the AUV relative to an underwater target are transformed to a second-order open-loop error dynamic model by using the prescribed performance bound technique. Then, a new tracking controller is proposed such that the tracking errors converge to an arbitrary small ultimate bound and their transient performance are guaranteed with a pre specified maximum overshoot and the convergence rate. To overcome unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances that are imposed on the vehicle by the wind, waves, and ocean currents, a multi-layer neural network and an adaptive robust controller are adopted. A Lyapunov stability synthesis shows that all signals of the control system are bounded, and tracking errors converge to a small region containing the origin with a prescribed performance. Finally, simulations are performed in MATLAB software and a comparative study verifies the theoretical results.

AB Outdoor images are having several applications including autonomous vehicles, geo-mapping, and surveillance. It is a common phenomenon that the images captured outdoor are prone to noise, which arises due to natural and manmade extreme atmospheric conditions such as haze, fog, and smog. Importantly in autonomous vehicle navigation, it is very important to recover the ground truth image to get the better decision by the system. Estimation of the transmission map and air-light is very crucial in recovering the ground truth image. In this study, the authors proposed a new method to estimate the transmission map based on a mean channel prior (MCP), which represents the depth map to estimate the transmission map. The authors proposed a deep neural network to identify the hazy image for the further dehazing process. In this study, the authors presented, two novel contributions, first an MCP-based image dehazing and second, a deep neural network-based identification of hazy images as a pre-processing block in the proposed end to end system. The proposed deep learning network using the TensorFlow platform provided validation accuracy of 93.4% for hazy image classification. Finally, the proposed MCP-based dehazing network showed better performance in terms of peak-signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, and computational time than that of existing methods.

Acoust. Soc. Am. 86, 1928-1939 (1989)]. Transmission loss was measured, for frequencies between 220 and 1228 Hz in an ocean waveguide, under conditions of an isovelocity water column with an approximate depth of 13 m over a sandy-silty bottom. Results obtained at 415 Hz show classic isovelocity waveguide phenomena that include interference effects, mode stripping due to modal attenuation, and transmission loss proportional 15 to 10 log(10)(R).

AB The problem of 3D cross-track control for underactuated 5-degrees-of-freedom (5-DOF) autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) is considered. The proposed decentralized controllers make the AUVs asymptotically constitute a desired formation that follows a given straight-line path with a given forward speed profile. The proposed controllers consist of two blocks. The first block, which is based on a Line of Sight guidance law, makes every AUV asymptotically follow straight line paths corresponding to the desired formation motion. The second block manipulates the forward speed of every AUV in such a way that they asymptotically converge to the desired formation and move with a desired forward speed profile. The results are illustrated with simulations.

AB The full adoption of electric autonomous vehicles (EAVs) will revolutionise the global transport system in general and road freight transport in particular. Traditional business models based on manufacturers selling trucks to operators could conceivably disappear. As with passenger transport, the rapid obsolescence of the technology and the cost will drive a non-ownership model and an evolution from products to services. Therefore it is expected that a new network operator will emerge to run this service, which in the future will likely develop into a fully smart network. As the value of the truck technology is reduced and the software component becomes the core source of value creation, it opens up the possibility of new entrants to the market who do not need to purchase physical assets at all and may instead rent them from a competitive pool of asset providers.
   Despite the recent growth in research on Mobility as a Service (MaaS) in passenger transport, these issues have been neglected in freight transport. The goal of this paper is to establish the features of this new smart network and derive a range of potential business models incorporating the changing roles of each actor, which are then evaluated against an analytical framework of business model innovation. The research concludes by proposing an update to the well-known OECD transportation model to include the network operator concept.

AB 3D object detection has recently become a research hotspot in the field of autonomous driving. Although great progress has been made, it still needs to be further improved. Therefore, this paper presents FDCA, a feature deep continuous aggregation network using multi-sensors for 3D vehicle detection. The proposed network adopts a two-stage structure with the bird's-eye view (BEV) map and the RGB image as an input. In the first stage, two feature extractors were used to generate feature maps with the high-resolution and representational ability for each input view. These feature maps were then fused and fed to a 3D proposal generator to obtain the reliable 3D vehicle proposals. In the second stage, the refinement network aggregated the features of the proposal regions further and performed classifications, a 3D bounding boxes regression, and orientation estimations to predict the location and heading of vehicles in 3D space. The FDCA network proposed was trained and evaluated on the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark. The experimental results of the validation set illustrated that compared with other fusion-based methods, the 3D average precision (AP) could achieve 76.82% on a moderate setting while having real-time capability, which was higher than that of the second-best performing method by 2.38%. Meanwhile, the results of ablation experiments show that the convergence rate of FDCA was much faster and the stability was also much better, making it a candidate for application in autonomous driving.

AB We tested the capabilities and limitations of a novel autonomous acoustic positioning telemetry system with data from fifteen field deployments off the Florida coast. Telemetry array coverage areas ranged between 100 and 300 m across. For fixed transmitters within the array, the fraction of transmissions leading to high-quality calculated position estimates averaged 44%, with wide variation. Positional accuracy was about 2 m. The choice of filtering strictness represented a trade-off between the accuracy and frequency of positions. There was substantial temporal variation, but no clear pattern (e.g., daily or tidal correlations) in frequency of positions. There was no spatial bias within the array. Array performance for stationary transmitters was robust to user errors in sound speed and hydrophone position estimates. Performance was less robust for a transmitter attached to an autonomous underwater vehicle moving through the array, with 22% of transmissions leading to position estimates. Overall the system produced reliable results, but as the use of acoustic telemetry in complex ecological studies increases it is important to recognize technological requirements and limitations.

AB This paper reviews the most recent literature on the optimization of car-sharing systems. Unlike other surveys, we do not focus on a single aspect of car-sharing systems, but we consider a wide range of optimization problems with a global view. Our aim is threefold. First, we revise the classic decision problems arising in car-sharing systems with conventional and electric vehicles, such as the fleet size, the station location, and the vehicle relocation. Then, we discuss some of the most recent decision problems arising in more innovative car-sharing systems, like those with autonomous vehicles, with mixed fleets, and the multi-modal and the time-dependent ones. Finally, we focus on new perspectives arising in the optimization of some innovative car-sharing services that are not yet (or little) investigated in the literature and that are worthy of attention from the operations research point of view. For each of them, we also highlight new and challenging open decision problems that deserve academic attention.

AB The Navy aims to create multiple unmanned vehicle systems containing Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) for search, identify, and intervention missions at sea. Until recent developments in technology, the combination of USV, UAVs, and UUVs had only been visions for the future. Now, various research groups from around the world are making the connections needed for the successful implementation of this idea. The team plans on creating a successful combination of the Unmanned Systems (UxVs) for future missions at sea. We use a Wave Adaptive Modular Vessel (WAM-V), WAM-V (2014), catamaran USV as the central node and main transport mechanism to carry UAVs and UUVs to distances over 100 miles. The system is designed to be modular and can easily be scaled up if needed. Over the next three-to-five years, the Center for Innovative Naval Technologies-Information Dominance (CINT-ID) Heterogeneous Autonomous Mobile Maritime Expeditionary Robots (HAMMER) project, funded by Office of Naval Research (ONR), aims to successfully integrate unmanned surface, aerial, and underwater vehicles. This report covers current progress involving the USV and UAV. Future developments to the project will include the integration of UUVs.

ID VISUAL NAVIGATION
AB We propose two schemes to solve the problems of visual perception delay and limited obstacle avoidance capability in the autonomous navigation of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV). In the aspect of visual perception, this paper presents a compressed algorithm based on the UNDERWATER-CUT model for underwater image enhancement and a two-stage compressed YOLOv5s model for object detection, simultaneously reducing the model volume, decreasing the run-time memory footprint, and lowering the number of computing opera-tions, without compromising enhancement effect and recognition accuracy. The 2D coordinates of the obstacles acquired by the visual perception algorithms and the depth values by the depth camera are then merged into real-time navigation information. In terms of obstacle avoidance, this paper proposes the adapted modified guidance vector field (AMGVF) to achieve autonomous navigation. A high-fidelity underwater simulation plat-form based on AirSim is constructed to jointly validate the above algorithms. Finally, the experimental results on visual perception and obstacle avoidance show that the above methods apply to the UUV well in complex un-derwater environment.

AB This paper investigates the time-varying formation containment problem for multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (MAUVs) system subject to actuator faults in three-dimensional space. The leader AUVs are required to track the virtual leader AUV with time-varying offset vectors, and at the same time the follower AUVs are demanded to converge into the convex hull formed by the leader AUVs. The extended state observers (ESOs) are designed to estimate the external disturbances and unknown nonlinearities of MAUVs system in real time, hence ensuring the anti-disturbance ability of MAUVs system. The tracking differentiators (TDs) are developed so as to avoid the differential explosion issues caused by the derivatives of the virtual control laws. The distributed formation containment control laws are put forward for compensating the impacts of unknown bounded actuator bias fault and loss of actuator effectiveness fault based on adaptive control strategy. Furthermore, the stability of MAUVs system is demonstrated by means of Lyapunov stability theory. At last, a numerical simulation is presented to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB This study proposes an autonomous truck (AT) based scheduling problem for container transshipment between two seaport terminals, in which ATs can travel in platoons with short inter-vehicle distance. The following vehicles in a platoon can save fuel consumption because of the reduced air resistance. Based on a fuel consumption function with respect to travel speed and platoon formation, we formulate a mixed-integer second-order-cone programming (MISOCP) model to minimize the total operation cost. To address the extra computational challenges caused by the requirements of platoon coordination, we develop a column-generation-based heuristic method in which two types of columns representing AT schedules and platoon schemes are generated and added into the master problem. According to the practice of container transshipment between two port terminals in Singapore, we conduct extensive numerical experiments and evaluate the performance of the proposed method up to the instance of 50 requests in a two-hour time limit. The results show that the proposed CG heuristic can outperform the state-of-the-art solver by around 10% for the instances with 40-50 requests.

AB To improve the performance of autonomous underwater vehicle in trajectory tracking control, which is subject to system uncertainties and time-varying external disturbances, a nonlinear disturbance observer-based sliding mode controller is proposed in the study. First, a reaching law with a special power function and a hyperbolic tangent function is presented. Then an improved sliding mode controller based on the new reaching law is combined to decrease the reaching time and avoid chattering during the trajectory tracking control. Furthermore, to reduce the influence of the system uncertainties and external disturbances, a nonlinear disturbance observer is introduced to identify them. The error asymptotic convergence of the trajectory tracking control is proved by the Lyapunov-like function. Finally, under different environmental disturbances, plenty of simulations are carried out to verify the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method. Results show that when it is tracking different trajectories, the proposed method can suppress the chattering and reduce the disturbances effectively, while ensuring tracking performance.

AB We have developed an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), Tantan, which can be used for Lake Biwa environment monitoring. The Japanese word Tantan means 'a freshwater explorer'. The length of Tantan is 2 m, its weight in air is 180 kg and its maximum speed in water is 2 knots. Tantan has two major missions. One is to monitor the three-dimensional structure of plankton distribution along thermocline by using its on-board submersible microscope, and the other is to monitor water quality such as dissolved oxygen in the benthic boundary layer by using a CTD instrument equipped with multiple sensors. The obtained data and images are transmitted to a surface research vessel (R/V) by ultrasonic waves as well as stored inside Tantan, and can be subsequently transferred from the R/V to our base institute (the Lake Biwa Research Institute) by a mobile phone data link. Several test experiments have been done in Lake Biwa, and we confirmed that Tantan could move smoothly up and down with an amplitude of 5 m along the isotherm of 15degreesC, which was the center of thermocline, and also can collect data.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) can generate major changes in urban systems due to their ability to use road infrastructures more efficiently and shorten trip times. However, there is great uncertainty about these effects and about whether the use of these vehicles will continue to be private, in continuity with the current paradigm, or whether they will become shared (carsharing/ridesharing). In order to try to shed light on these matters, the use of a scenario-based methodology and the evaluation of the scenarios using a land use-transport interaction model (LUTI model TRANSPACE) is proposed. This model allows simulating the impacts that changes in the transport system can generate on the location of households and companies oriented to local demand and accessibility conditions. The obtained results allow us to state that, if AVs would generate a significant increase in the capacity of urban and interurban road infrastructures, the impacts on mobility and on the location of activities could be positive, with a decrease in the distances traveled, trip times, and no evidence of significant urban sprawl processes. However, if these increases in capacity are accompanied by a large augment in the demand for shared journeys by new users (young, elderly) or empty journeys, the positive effects could disappear. Thus, this scenario would imply an increase in trip times, reduced accessibilities, and longer average distances traveled, all of which could cause the unwanted effect of expelling activities from the consolidated urban center.

SO JOURNAL OF NAVIGATION
LA English

DE trajectory-planning; land vehicle guidance; visual field model
ID NAVIGATION
AB We propose a robust trajectory planning method for vision-based autonomous land vehicle (ALV) guidance by target following using a visual field model. The proposed trajectory planning method aims to guide the ALV to achieve the goal that the targeted person will always appear in the image. It is found in this study that the goal can be achieved if three visual contact constraints in the visual field model are satisfied. The first constraint postulates that the target has appeared in the image. The second constraint asks that the vehicle head at the next position points straight towards to the target's current position. The third constraint sets bounds between the next position of the ALV and the current position of the target. A formula for the trajectory of the vehicle that satisfies the second visual contact constraint is derived. The steps for generating a speed and a turn angle of the ALV for real-time navigation are described as a trajectory-planning algorithm. Finally, the approach is tested on a real ALV and successful navigation sessions confirm the feasibility and the robustness of the approach.

AB Following the arc of automation, it is expected that many driverless vehicles will soon be on the road. The need for autonomous traffic to self-organize necessitates the development of advanced algorithms for unsupervised machine-to-machine negotiation.
   Mechanisms rooted in game theory detect and resolve contradictions among agents with differing objectives and enable automated collaboration with a socially beneficial outcome. A case study of cyber-enabled vehicles following private objectives and using private ranked preferences to bid for lane and speed changes on a multi-lane highway illustrates interactions that rely on mechanism design. The presented approach constitutes a strategyproof mechanism and thus induces the truthfullness of bids. A lane position and speed setting allocation rule detects and resolves conflict and provides an option for monetization. A NetLogo simulation implements the methodology described. The model allows for additional resources or resource dimensions. Minor domain specific alterations to the distance operator can translate to many application areas and scenarios providing multiple or multi-dimensional resource allocation for a fee.

AB The purpose of this paper is to describe the design and implementation of an unmanned ground vehicle, called the TailGator at CIMAR (Center for Intelligent Machines and Robotics) of the University of Florida. The TailGator is a gas powered, four-wheeled vehicle that was designed for the AUVS1 Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition and has been tested in the contest for 2 years. The vehicle control model and design of the sensory systems are described. The competition is comprised of two events called the Autonomous Challenge and the Navigation Challenge: For the autonomous challenge, line following, obstacle avoidance, and detection are required. Line following is accomplished with a camera system. Obstacle avoidance and detection are accomplished with a laser scanner. For the navigation challenge, waypoint following and obstacle detection are required. The waypoint navigation is implemented with a global positioning system. The TailGator has provided an educational test bed for not only the contest requirements but also other studies in developing artificial intelligence algorithms such as adaptive control, creative control, automatic calibration, and internet-base control. The significance of this effort is in helping engineering and technology students understand the transition from theory to practice.

AB This paper presents a training dataset of point-wisely labeled global point cloud map (GPCM) in urban area. The labeled GPCM dataset can be used to train machine learning models for point cloud semantic segmentation (PCSS). The trained PCSS machine learning model can classify the semantic class of urban GPCM point-wisely to build a semantic GPCM (SGPCM). The SGPCM can be used to enhance the functionality of many intelligent and autonomous vehicle applications, such as localization, map-based perception, and high-definition (HD) map processing. To maximize the utility of the training dataset for the applications, the semantic classes are designed taking into account the requirements of intelligent and autonomous vehicles in urban area. Therefore, the classes contain urban-related objects, such as road surface markers, curba, and in-tunnel objects, which were not included in other previous datasets. First step of construction process for the PCSS training dataset is a generation of the GPCM in the urban area by using a mobile mapping system (MMS). The points in the generated GPCM with MMS contain information about the position (X, Y, Z) and the surface (R, G, B, I). After building the unlabeled GPCM, each point is labeled with the designed semantic classes thorough semi-automatic and manual labeling. The labeled SGPCM was used to train various state-of-the-art PCSS models to verify the effectiveness of SGPCM train-set for the intelligent and autonomous vehicles.

TI Autonomous Vehicles' Turning Motion Planning for Conflict Areas at

AB An essential and challenging task for autonomous vehicles (AVs) is turning at mixed-flow intersections when they interact with motorized, non-motorized and pedestrian traffic simultaneously. In these situations, sensor measurement noise and blind zones create additional complexity in an already problematic environment. In order to make motion planning feasible in a multi-interaction environment with detection uncertainty feasible, this article proposes a hierarchical framework that divides the highly-related driving process into a decision, planning and action layer. The decision layer first employs a logit model combined with Bayes' theorem to make a discrete choice about whether to turn or not. Then, the plan layer initializes a local trajectory with selected waypoints considering the location of interacting objects based on a Bezier curve. Finally, feedback is used to adjust the vehicle's decision and trajectory plan when collision risks increase due to the unexpected behavior of other objects. Additionally, in order to consider sensor data noise and blind zones of AVs, an Extended Kalman filter (EKF) was used to estimate the status of sensory targets. The performance of the proposed model was compared with drivers' performance for the same turning scenarios at two mixed-flow intersections. The results show that the simulation produced human-like flexibility when planning trajectories in a multi-interaction environment. Moreover, the travel time of AVs did not show a statistically significant difference when compared with manually driven vehicles (MVs). Instead, the AVs actually performed better in terms of safety than the MVs.

AB Path Following and Collision Avoidance, be it for unmanned surface vessels or other autonomous vehicles, are two fundamental guidance problems in robotics. For many decades, they have been subject to academic study, leading to a vast number of proposed approaches. However, they have mostly been treated as separate problems, and have typically relied on non-linear first-principles models with parameters that can only be determined experimentally. The rise of deep reinforcement learning in recent years suggests an alternative approach: end-to-end learning of the optimal guidance policy from scratch by means of a trial-and-error based approach. In this article, we explore the potential of Proximal Policy Optimization, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm with demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on Continuous Control tasks, when applied to the dual-objective problem of controlling an autonomous surface vehicle in a COLREGs compliant manner such that it follows an a priori known desired path while avoiding collisions with other vessels along the way. Based on high-fidelity elevation and AIS tracking data from the Trondheim Fjord, an inlet of the Norwegian sea, we evaluate the trained agent's performance in challenging, dynamic real-world scenarios where the ultimate success of the agent rests upon its ability to navigate non-uniform marine terrain while handling challenging, but realistic vessel encounters.

AB Finding a free parking lot contributes largely to a total traffic congestion and increases gas emissions in urban and overpopulated cities. Recent advances in smart parking systems adopt Internet of Things (IoT) concepts which tend to improve traffic bottlenecks by providing information about available parking lots. The detection of vehicle presence at the parking lot usually means adopting solutions comprised of power-hungry and battery-operated sensor devices. In this article a hardware-based approach is introduced which aims at building a self-powered and autonomous sensing node equipped with supercapacitors (battery less) to feel the vehicle presence. For purposes of detection, solar-based energy harvester and wake-up trigger prototype is considered along with a Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) radio. The joint use of such technologies is exploited to develop a power autonomous node capable of cost-effectively sensing the car presence and transmitting the parking lot status. The developed triggering system consumes only 150 nA making it suitable as a low-power solution. To initiate the trigger only 6.5 W/m(2) in light level change is required comparing the two panels, which is more than adequate as the comparison of solar irradiance measured under the vehicle against diffuse horizontal irradiance shows a significant difference. The developed prototype uses a magnetometer to verify the vehicle presence upon trigger generation and BLE 5.0 technology for status change update, while supercapacitor discharge lifetime duration is estimated to be around 13 days in harsh conditions without charging from solar cells.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Trajectory prediction and behavioral decision-making are two important tasks for autonomous vehicles that require a good understanding of the environmental context. Notably, behavioral decisions are better made by referring to the outputs of trajectory predictions. However, most current solutions perform these tasks separately. Therefore, this paper proposes a new joint holistic transformer network that combines multiple cues to predict trajectories and make behavioral decisions simultaneously. To better explore the intrinsic relationships among cues, the network uses existing knowledge and adopts three kinds of attention mechanisms: the sparse multi-head type for reducing noise impact, feature selection sparse type for optimally using partial prior knowledge, and multi-head with sigmoid activation type for optimally using posteriori knowledge. Compared with other trajectory prediction models, the proposed model has a better comprehensive performance and good interpretability. Perceptual noise robustness experiments demonstrate that the proposed model has good noise robustness. Thus, simultaneous trajectory prediction and behavioral decision-making combining multiple cues are accomplished, which reduces computational costs and enhances semantic relationships between scenes and agents.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This article presents two new chemical plume tracing (CPT) algorithms for using on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to locate hydrothermal vents. We aim to design effective CPT navigation algorithms that direct AUVs to trace emitted hydrothermal plumes to the hydrothermal vent. Traditional CPT algorithms can be grouped into two categories, including bio-inspired and engineering-based methods, but they are limited by either search inefficiency in turbulent flow environments or high computational costs. To approach this problem, we design a new CPT algorithm by fusing traditional CPT methods. Specifically, two deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, including double deep Q-network (DDQN) and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), are employed to train a customized deep neural network that dynamically combines two traditional CPT algorithms during the search process. Simulation experiments show that both DDQN- and DDPG-based CPT algorithms achieve a high success rate (>90%) in either laminar or turbulent flow environments. Moreover, compared to traditional moth-inspired method, the averaged search time is improved by 67% for the DDQN- and 44% for the DDPG-based CPT algorithms in turbulent flow environments.

AB This paper presents a novel approach for depth precision control of under-actuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) subject to model uncertainties, ocean currents, and input constraints. Specifically, a trans-formation is made to convert the input constraint problem into a state constraint problem. Subsequently, an observer-based guidance law is developed to deal with the drift affected by unknown ocean currents by using an extended disturbance observer (EDO). An adaptive neural controller is then designed using the DSC technique and an advanced modified integral barrier Lyapunov function (mIBLF) to guarantee that all states are confined within the given constraint. Besides, a novel nonlinear disturbance observer is introduced to cope with external disturbances and neural network approximation errors. It is proved that all closed-loop signals are uniformly ultimately bounded by Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness and outstanding characteristics of the proposed method.

AB A novel magnetic coupler (MC) with cross-coupling mode is proposed in this article, which has merits of fit-to-surface and lightweight in receiver, and supports stable and efficient charging for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The proposed magnetic structure employing an arc bipolar transmitter and a compact dipole-coil-based receiver utilizes horizontal flux to establish strong and stable coupling against three-dimensional misalignment; the MC structure is constructed and optimized according to the magnetic field distribution characteristics. The influence of geometric parameters on the MC's performance is obtained based on ANSYS Maxwell simulation, with which the parameters of MC are optimized. In order to fully verify the performance of the designed MC, an AUV wireless charging system circuit is also developed. A wireless charging system prototype is built and tested with a 600 g receiver, and it can deliver 1 kW at a dc-to-dc efficiency of 95.1%. The experimental results under various operating conditions indicate that the proposed MC is viable and can be used for charging the AUVs.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AV) are expected to bring considerable benefits to society, such as traffic optimization and accidents reduction. They rely heavily on advances in many Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches and techniques. However, while some researchers in this field believe AI is the core element to enhance safety, others believe AI imposes new challenges to assure the safety of these new AI-based systems and applications. In this non-convergent context, this paper presents a systematic literature review to paint a clear picture of the state of the art of the literature in AI on AV safety. Based on an initial sample of 4870 retrieved papers, 59 studies were selected as the result of the selection criteria detailed in the paper. The shortlisted studies were then mapped into six categories to answer the proposed research questions. An AV system model was proposed and applied to orient the discussions about the SLR findings. As a main result, we have reinforced our preliminary observation about the necessity of considering a serious safety agenda for the future studies on AI-based AV systems.

ID DISTURBANCE REJECTION
AB This paper proposes the extended state observer (ESO)-based active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) for the speed tracking of an autonomous vehicle. Uncertainties, both in the vehicle plant and in the sensors, such as nonlinear uncertainties due to the powertrain dynamics, variations in rolling resistance and air resistance, are all estimated in real-time by an extended state observer (ESO). Furthermore, a simple vehicle longitudinal dynamics model, including a mean value engine model (MVEM), is implemented to obtain the parameters in ADRC and design a feedforward controller to enhance the controller's performance. The proposed controller is validated through CarSim((R))/Simulink((R)) simulations and road tests. The simulation validates the adaptiveness of the proposed controller against the well-tuned proportional integral derivative (PID) controller, and the speed tracking error of the proposed controller is within 1.26% in simulation. Simulation results also show that fuel consumption can be improved by 3.6% by changing the accelerator pedal depth and positive rate. Finally, the road tests are completed under four kinds of road conditions, and the maximum tracking error is smaller than 0.5 km/h.

ID ROUTING PROBLEM
AB The VIPAFLEET project consists in developing models and algorithms for managing a fleet of Individual Public Autonomous Vehicles (VIPA). Hereby, we consider a fleet of cars distributed at specified stations in an industrial area to supply internal transportation, where the cars can be used in different modes of circulation (tram mode, elevator mode, taxi mode). One goal is to develop and implement suitable algorithms for each mode in order to satisfy all the requests under an economic point of view by minimizing the total tour length. The innovative idea and challenge of the project is to develop and install a dynamic fleet management system that allows the operator to switch between the different modes within the different periods of the day according to the dynamic transportation demands of the users. We model the underlying online transportation system and propose a corresponding fleet management framework, to handle modes, demands and commands. We consider two modes of circulation, tram and elevator mode, propose for each mode appropriate online algorithms and evaluate their performance, both in terms of competitive analysis and practical behavior.

AB Autonomous aerial refueling is a significant technology that can significantly extend the endurance of unmanned aerial vehicles. A reliable method that can accurately estimate the position and attitude of the probe relative to the drogue is the key to such a capability. A drogue pose estimation method based on infrared vision sensor is introduced with the general goal of yielding an accurate and reliable drogue state estimate. First, by employing direct least squares ellipse fitting and convex hull in OpenCV, a feature point matching and interference point elimination method is proposed. In addition, considering the conditions that some infrared LEDs are damaged or occluded, a missing point estimation method based on perspective transformation and affine transformation is designed. Finally, an accurate and robust pose estimation algorithm improved by the runner-root algorithm is proposed. The feasibility of the designed visual measurement system is demonstrated by flight test, and the results indicate that our proposed method enables precise and reliable pose estimation of the probe relative to the drogue, even in some poor conditions.

AB A timely understanding of target vehicles (TVs) lateral behavior is essential for the decision-making and control of host vehicle. Existing physical model-based methods such as motion-based method and multiple centerline-based method are generally constructed based on TV pose and longitudinal velocity, and tend to ignore TV preview driving characteristic and other useful information such as lateral velocity and yaw rate. To address these issues, a driver preview and multiple centerline model-based probabilistic behavior recognition architecture is proposed for timely and accurate TV lateral behavior prediction. Firstly, a driver preview model is used to describe vehicle preview driving characteristic, and TV preview lateral offset and preview lateral velocity are calculated with TV states and road reference information. Then, the preview lateral offset and preview lateral velocity are combined with multiple centerline model for TV lateral behavior reasoning based on the interacting multiple model-based probabilistic behavior recognition algorithm. With this method, TV preview driving characteristic and lateral motion states are combined for precise TV lateral behavior description. Furthermore, to predict short-term lateral behavior, a preview lateral velocity-dependent transition probability matrix model constructed with Gaussian cumulative distribution function is proposed. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method considering vehicle preview driving characteristic predicts TV lateral behavior earlier than the conventional method.

AB Road safety is an important public health issue; technology, policy, and educational interventions to prevent crashes are of significant interest to researchers and policymakers. In particular, there is significant ongoing research to proactively evaluate the safety of new technologies, including autonomous vehicles, before enough crashes occur to directly measure their impact.We analyze the distributional form of five diverse datasets that approximate motor vehicle safety incident severity, including one dataset of hard braking events that characterizes the severity of non-crash incidents. Our empirical analysis finds that all five datasets closely fit a lognormal distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance < 0.013; significance of loglikelihood ratio with other distributions < 0.000029).We demonstrate a linkage between two well-known but largely qualitative safety frameworks and the severity distributions observed in the data. We create a formal model of the Swiss Cheese Model (SCM) and show through analysis and simulations that this formalization leads to a lognormal distribution of the severity continuum of safety-critical incidents. This finding is not only consistent with the empirical data we examine, but represents a quantitative restatement of Heinrich's Triangle, another heretofore largely qualitative framework that hypothesizes that safety events of increasing severity have decreasing frequency.Our results support the use of more frequent, low-severity events to rapidly assess safety in the absence of less frequent, high-severity events for any system consistent with our formalization of SCM. This includes any complex system designed for robustness to single-point failures, including autonomous vehicles.

AB Despite the urgent need for continuous risk assessments during autonomous driving, achieving reliable assessment results is still challenging because of the unpredictable behaviors of adjacent human drivers and the resulting complexity. Such complexity increases particularly during lane changes because several vehicles need to interact with other vehicles. Therefore, this paper proposes a new framework to analyze lane-changing risk on freeways considering the forecastability in adjacent vehicles. Virtual lane-change scenarios are constructed based on historical maneuvers in adjacent vehicles, and the risk of potential lane change is evaluated through the safety evaluation result of the scenario. Adjacent vehicles' future maneuvers are predicted using a multivariate Bayesian structural time series model, and the forecastability is estimated as the standard error of the predicted values. The failure probability of those lane-changing scenarios is obtained through the first-order reliability method, assuming that failure occurred when any time-to-collision value for adjacent vehicles was less than a threshold at the end of the lane change. This study tested two scenarios with three levels of uncertainty to show the effect of uncertainty on the level of risk. The results showed that the reduced uncertainty allowed a clearer distinction between risky situations. The proposed framework differentiates itself from existing methods by estimating higher risk in an adjacent vehicle's more significant uncertainties. It is expected that the outcome of this study will be valuable in developing reliable lane-change strategies in autonomous driving.

AB This paper introduces a method for dynamic fleet mission planning for autonomous mining (in loop-free maps), in which a dynamic fleet mission is defined as a sequence of static fleet missions, each generated using a modified genetic algorithm. For the case of static fleet mission planning (where each vehicle completes just one mission), the proposed method is able to reliably generate, within a short optimization time, feasible fleet missions with short total duration and as few stops as possible. For the dynamic case, in simulations involving a realistic mine map, the proposed method is able to generate efficient dynamic plans such that the number of completed missions per vehicle is only slightly reduced as the number of vehicles is increased, demonstrating the favorable scaling properties of the method as well as its applicability in real-world cases.

AB Single-beacon navigation for group autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) suffers from long navigation period and asynchronization. This paper addresses the problem by introducing the singleinput-multiple-output (SIMO) model, where, a single AUV transmits the signal and other AUVs receive the signal. Utilizing the time-delay of signals from the beacon and the sender, the navigation for all AUVs is achieved simultaneously, and the navigation period is dramatically decreased. Moreover, based on the new SIMO model, a tracking method utilizing extended Kalman filter is also put forward to increase the navigation precision and reduce the computational burden. Finally, a coordinate fusion algorithm based on the location, error, and time-delay is presented, which fuses the independent AUV coordinates to be a higher precision holistic coordinate system for group AUVs. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Small-scale unmanned aerial vehicles are being deployed in urban areas for missions such as ground target tracking, crime scene monitoring, and traffic management. Aerial vehicles deployed in such cluttered environments are required to have robust autonomous navigation with both target tracking and obstacle avoidance capabilities. To this end, this work presents a simple-to-design but effective steerable sensor platform and its implementation techniques for both obstacle avoidance and target tracking. The proposed platform is a 2-axis gimbal system capable of roll and pitch/yaw. The mathematical model that governs the dynamics of this platform is developed. The performance of the platform is validated through a software-in-the-loop simulation. The simulation results show that the platform can be effectively steered to all regions of interest except backward. With its design layout and mount location, the platform can engage sensors for obstacle avoidance and target tracking as per requirements. Moreover, steering the platform in any direction does not induce aerodynamic instability on the unmanned aerial vehicle in mission.

TI Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control for a Platoon of Connected and
   Autonomous Vehicles considering Dynamic Information Flow Topology
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
ID PROPAGATION WAVE; CONTROL STRATEGY; DESIGN; CACC
AB Vehicle-to-vehicle communications can be unreliable as interference causes communication failures. Thereby, the information flow topology (IFT) for a platoon of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can vary dynamically. This limits existing cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) strategies as most of them assume a fixed IFT. To address this problem, a CACC scheme is introduced that considers a dynamic information flow topology (CACC-DIFT) for CAV platoons. An adaptive proportional-derivative (PD) controller under a two-predecessor-following IFT is proposed to attenuate the negative effects when communication failures occur. The parameters of the PD controller are determined to ensure the string stability of the platoon. Furthermore, the proposed PD controller also factors the performance of individual vehicles. Hence, when communication failure occurs, the system will switch to a certain type of CACC instead of degenerating to adaptive cruise control, which improves the platoon control performance considerably. The effectiveness of the proposed CACC-DIFT is validated through numerical experiments based on Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) field data. Simulation results indicate that the proposed CACC-DIFT design outperforms CACC based on a predetermined information flow topology.

ID SLIDING MODE CONTROL
AB The efficient control of a vehicle's depth is a ubiquitous need of underwater vehicles for long term deployments. Using standard hydrodynamic drag and lift formulations for a hybrid autonomous underwater glider (AUG) the performance penalty for long range underwater vehicles with a non zero buoyant force is shown to be significant. To this end, an energy optimal depth controller design methodology for a long range autonomous underwater vehicle is presented with applications to a propeller driven hybrid AUG during level flight. The method makes use of a reduced order linear model that has been validated from field data. The standard state space model is augmented with the state integral matrix and rewritten to the state error representation. The resulting representation is well suited to the computation of energy optimal gains for a linear quadratic regulator. Field demonstrations of the standard pitching depth controller and the energy optimal depth controller using the computed gains shows the reduced order model to be sufficient for the purpose of the controller design, improving on the standard pitching depth controller response, transport efficiency and ease of tuning.

AB One of the most dynamic industries nowadays is the automotive industry. It has dramatically changed from safe, comfortable, and equipped with many entertainment systems to connected autonomous vehicles during the last decade. Although the "Connected Autonomous vehicles"trend dramatically influences the economy, it increases automation and connectivity. Consequently, vehicles can be considered an Internet of Things (IoT) network. Accordingly, the cyberattack surface is more significant, with many vulnerabilities. Considering the fundamental security weakness of automotive onboard networks, besides their superimposing, we firmly believe that a unified security solution is required to resolve the current automotive security problem. This paper proposes an automotive security solution called Generic Automotive Security Suit (GASS). (GASS) is designed to be a practical security solution deployed in the complicated automotive environment. In addition, it defines a standard secure inter-communication between onboard networks. We also introduce the Lightweight Generic Authentication Protocol (LXAP) as the building block of the GASS. We address different security scenarios which face the industry nowadays. The new proposed system does not affect the complexity level of the automotive network. In addition, our simulation results have shown that the LXAP enables security preservation over vehicles' complex networks.

AB Reasonable test scenarios and objective evaluation methods could rapidly promote the development of autonomous technology. The current quantitative evaluation method of automated vehicles could comprehensively evaluate the performance of autonomous driving systems rather than only focused on effectiveness. However, it needed massive participation of experts, which led to the strong subjectivity for the evaluation result. In order to reduce the participation of experts and implement automatic test evaluation, especially in the virtual environment, an objective automated vehicle evaluation method was proposed. The proposed methodology utilized the idea of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). It combines the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method and the improved criteria importance though intercriteria correlation (CRITIC) method to determine the weight of the evaluation index. Then the adaptive grey relational analysis (GRA) algorithm was implemented to evaluate the performance of the automated vehicle. The experiment in a virtual environment scenario showed that the evaluation results of the proposed method had high consistency with the traditional human intervention evaluation algorithm. Meanwhile, it reduced the subjectivity and saved the cost of inviting a large number of experts to participate in the evaluation.

TI A Framework for Estimating Long Term Driver Behavior
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB We present a framework for estimation of long term driver behavior for autonomous vehicles and vehicle safety systems. The Hybrid State System and Hidden Markov Model (HSS+HMM) system discussed in this article is capable of describing the hybrid characteristics of driver and vehicle coupling. In our model, driving observations follow a continuous trajectory that can be measured to create continuous state estimates. These continuous state estimates can then be used to estimate the most likely driver state using decision-behavior coupling inherent to the HSS+HMM system. The HSS+HMM system is encompassed in a HSS structure and intersystem connectivity is determined by using signal processing and pattern recognition techniques. The proposed method is suitable for a number of autonomous and vehicle safety scenarios such as estimating intent of other vehicles near intersections or avoiding hazardous driving events such as unexpected lane changes. The long term driver behavior estimation system involves an extended HSS+HMM structure that is capable of including external information in the estimation process. Through the grafting and pruning of metastates, the HSS+HMM system can be dynamically updated to best represent driver choices given external information. Three application examples are also provided to elucidate the theoretical system.

AB In this paper, we propose an environment perception framework for autonomous driving using state representation learning (SRL). Unlike existing Q-learning based methods for efficient environment perception and object detection, our proposed method takes the learning loss into account under deterministic as well as stochastic policy gradient. Through a combination of variational autoencoder (VAE), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), and soft actor-critic (SAC), we focus on uninterrupted and reasonably safe autonomous driving without steering off the track for a considerable driving distance. Our proposed technique exhibits learning in autonomous vehicles under complex interactions with the environment, without being explicitly trained on driving datasets. To ensure the effectiveness of the scheme over a sustained period of time, we employ a reward-penalty based system where a negative reward is associated with an unfavourable action and a positive reward is awarded for favourable actions. The results obtained through simulations on DonKey simulator show the effectiveness of our proposed method by examining the variations in policy loss, value loss, reward function, and cumulative reward for 'VAE+DDPG' and 'VAE+SAC' over the learning process.

TI Resilience-Oriented Scheduling of Shared Autonomous Electric Vehicles: A
   Cooperation Framework for Electrical Distribution Networks and

SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB As autonomous electric vehicles and car-sharing services are becoming more popular, the contribution of shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEVs) to the future of urban transportation is getting more achievable. Like conventional electric vehicles, SAEVs can provide power grids with ancillary services. This article proposes a new scheduling scheme for SAEV fleets within a cooperative plan to let power distribution networks benefit from the energy storage of vehicle batteries in recovering critical loads after a predictable extreme event. According to a long-term contract, the detailed request of the distribution system operator (DSO), together with desired constraints and perquisites, is sent to the SAEVs aggregator (SA) prior to the landfall of a predictable extreme event. Afterward, SA runs a targeted algorithm to schedule trip assignments and charging cycles of SAEVs so that the required constraints of DSO are satisfied. The SAEV participants will continue carrying passengers within the scheduled time horizon in addition to delivering energy to the distribution network at the scheduling deadline declared by DSO. This deadline is the time instant when the capacity of the SAEV fleet may be no more applicable to enhance the system preparedness against the approaching event. Numerical results illustrated that the proposed scheme helps improve the power grid resilience by delivering 2396.1 kWh of energy to the distribution network in addition to increasing the total income of each participant SAEV by about 130%. Thus, it is implied that the proposed method offers a win-win situation for both entities.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are playing an increasingly important role in ocean exploration. In some applications, an AUV can be tethered by a communication cable, such as an optical fiber, for real-time surveillance. This article focuses on the motion analysis of the AUV and cable coupling system to investigate the interaction between AUV and cable dynamic behaviors, especially under the current disturbance in the dynamic ocean environment. The dynamic equations of the coupled AUV and cable are derived using the well-known finite difference method and solved using the advanced trust-region method in MATLAB. The model-based simulation scheme is presented and further verified by comparing the simulation results with the validated ones published in the existing literature. The motion cases when the tethered vehicle maneuvers in a variety of motion modes and current scenarios are studied to conduct a systematic motion analysis. Both the variation in the cable tension at the towpoint and the configuration of the cable in the water are investigated. Based on the understanding of the cable and current effects on AUV motion, this article further explores the antitwining maneuvering strategy for the cable-tethered AUV moving in currents. The findings in this work can provide theoretical guidance for the safe operation of the AUV and cable coupling system in the field.

AB Autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) are receiving increasing attention, and the motion planning and control problem for these vehicles has become a hot research topic. In real applications such as material handling, an AGV is subject to large uncertainties and its motion planning and control become challenging. In this article, we investigate this problem by proposing a hierarchical control scheme, which is integrated by a model predictive control (MPC)-based path planning and trajectory tracking control at the high level, and a reduced-order extended state observer (RESO)-based dynamic control at the low level. The control at the high level consists of an MPC-based improved path planner, a velocity planner, and an MPC-based tracking controller. Both the path planning and trajectory tracking control problems are formulated under an MPC framework. The control at the low level employs the idea of active disturbance rejection control (ADRC). The uncertainties are estimated via a RESO and then compensated in the control in real time. We show that, for the first-order uncertain AGV dynamic model, the RESO-based control only needs to know the control direction. Finally, simulations and experiments on an AGV with different payloads are conducted. The results illustrate that the proposed hierarchical control scheme achieves satisfactory motion planning and control performance with large uncertainties.

AB Extreme events can extensively damage power systems, causing customers to experience long-lasting outages. During such events, an electric vehicle (EV) can be used to directly power a house, i.e., vehicle-to-home (V2H). Specifically, the EV serves as a mobile energy storage system-running errands to "transport" energy from other places. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) further allows cooperation among houses. It enables EV fleets to take turns running the errands so that sustained power supply is possible. Moreover, autonomous driving technology can also benefit system adequacy because the charging errands of EVs can be scheduled flexibly without being bonded to human activities. An emergency power supply strategy featuring scheduled EV charging errands as introduced above is proposed. It answers the questions whether and to what extent a system can survive an extended period of outage with the use of EVs only. An optimization problem is formulated with the purpose of maximizing the supply adequacy of the isolated system during the outage period. Both V2H and V2G scenarios are considered in the problem formulation, as well as self-driving capability. The complex optimization problems are solved with genetic algorithm. It is significant to find from the case study that the proposed strategy is able to fully restoring an islanded system when V2G and self-driving EVs are implemented.

AB In this brief, a receding horizon control scheme for solving the obstacle avoidance motion planning problem of autonomous vehicles operating in uncertain dynamic environments is developed. By considering robots described by discrete-time linear time-invariant models, we propose a set-theoretic-based architecture to deal with disturbance effects, and input and state constraints. As one of its main merits, the strategy is capable of taking care of time-varying obstacle scenarios by jointly exploiting robust positively invariant region and one-step controllable set concepts. The resulting scheme guarantees uniformly ultimate boundedness and constraints fulfilment regardless of any admissible obstacle configuration.

AB Robust attitude control is an essential aspect of research on autonomous flight of flapping wing Micro Air Vehicles. The mechanical solutions by which the necessary control moments are realised come at the price of extra weight and possible loss of aerodynamic efficiency. Stable flight of these vehicles has been shown by several designs using a conventional tail, but also by tailless designs that use active control of the wings. In this study a control mechanism is proposed that provides active control over the wings. The mechanism improves vehicle stability and agility by generation of control moments for roll, pitch and yaw. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by static measurements around all the three axes. Flight test results confirm that the attitude of the test vehicle, including a tail, can be successfully controlled in slow forward flight conditions. Furthermore, the flight envelope is extended with robust hovering and the ability to reverse the flight direction using a small turn space. This capability is very important for autonomous flight capabilities such as obstacle avoidance. Finally, it is demonstrated that the proposed control mechanism allows for tailless hovering flight.

AB Connected and Autonomous Vehicles is a technology that will be disruptive for all layers of traffic control. The Lagrangian, in-the-flow nature of their operation offers untapped new potentials for sensing and actuation, but also presents new fundamental challenges. In order to use these vehicles for traffic state reconstruction and control, we need suitable traffic models, which should be computationally efficient and able to represent complex traffic phenomena. To this end, we propose the Front-tracking Transition System Model, a cell-free modelling approach that can incorporate Lagrangian measurements, and has a structure that yields itself to on-line model learning and control. The model is formulated as a transition system, and based on the front-tracking method for finding entropy solutions to the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model. We characterize the solution of this model and show that it corresponds to the solution of the underlying PDE traffic model. Algorithms for traffic state reconstruction and model learning are proposed, exploiting the model structure. The model is then used to design a prediction -based control law for stop-and-go wave dissipation using randomly arriving Connected and Autonomous Vehicles. The proposed control framework is able to estimate the traffic state and model, adapt to changes in the traffic dynamics, and achieve a reduction in vehicles' Total Time Spent.

AB This paper extends the progress of single beacon one-way-travel-time (OWTT) range measurements for constraining XY position for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV). Traditional navigation algorithms have used OWTT measurements to constrain an inertial navigation system aided by a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL). These methodologies limit AUV applications to where DVL bottom-lock is available as well as the necessity for expensive strap-down sensors, such as the DVL. Thus, deep water, mid-water column research has mostly been left untouched, and vehicles that need expensive strap-down sensors restrict the possibility of using multiple AUVs to explore a certain area. This work presents a solution for accurate navigation and localization using a vehicle's odometry determined by its dynamic model velocity and constrained by OWTT range measurements from a topside source beacon as well as other AUVs operating in proximity. We present a comparison of two navigation algorithms: an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a Particle Filter(PF). Both of these algorithms also incorporate a water velocity bias estimator that further enhances the navigation accuracy and localization. Closed-loop online field results on local waters as well as a real-time implementation of two days field trials operating in Monterey Bay, California during the Keck Institute for Space Studies oceanographic research project prove the accuracy of this methodology with a root mean square error on the order of tens of meters compared to GPS position over a distance traveled of multiple kilometers.

AB While autonomous vehicles (AVs) are potentially the future of transportation, one of the main issues that need to be addressed is their behaviour and response to adverse weather conditions. Herein, we proposed a research frame to understand and mitigate the impact of weather stressors (wind, rain, snow, ice, and fog) on AVs. A recently launched initiative to design and engineer an indigenous Canadian road vehicle served as a background for this intended framework. The proposed frame consists of (i) on-road testing and numerical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to derive statistically significant critical weather conditions (weather design cases, WDCs) and (ii) simulation of these weather conditions in the ACE climatic wind tunnel at Ontario Tech University, Canada, to (iii) identify adaptive controls to minimize the effects of the WDCs on vehicles improving their aerodynamics, safety, and sensor functionality. This framework is intended to (i) provoke discussions among the AV industry and research stakeholders in Canada and elsewhere and (ii) provide a context for future research in related areas such as AV aerodynamics, maneuverability, weather impacts (e.g., wind, rain, snow, ice, and fog), sensors, and soiling.

AB Trajectory tracking is a key technology for precisely controlling autonomous vehicles. The characteristics of an independent drive electric vehicle (IDEV) are used as the basis for designing a trajectory tracking algorithm using a hierarchical strategy. While the upper controller tracks the desired trajectory based on model predictive control (MPC), the middle controller adjusts the speed using the fuzzy theory to optimize the parameters of the proportional integral (PI) controller and generates an additional yaw control moment based on sliding mode control (SMC). Finally, the lower controller distributes the torque to each wheel according to stability and adhesion conditions. A co-simulation platform is established to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm under typical scenarios. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm can provide good dynamic driving ability at high speeds and on low-adhesion roads. The accuracy of trajectory tracking using the proposed algorithm is better than that of the traditional preview-follower driver model and the performance of the proposed torque distribution algorithm is superior to that of the traditional even torque distribution algorithm.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are becoming increasingly popular, and this can potentially affect road performance. Road performance also influences driving comfort and safety for AVs. In this study, the influence of changes in traffic volume and wheel track distribution caused by AVs on the rutting distress of asphalt pavement was investigated through finite element simulations. A vehicle-mounted three-dimensional laser profiler was used to obtain pavement roughness and texture information. The vehicle vibration acceleration was obtained through vehicle dynamics simulations, and the skid resistance indexes of 20 rutting specimens were collected. The results showed that an increase in traffic volume caused by the increasing AV traffic accelerated the occurrence of rutting distress; however, the uniform distribution of vehicles at both ends of the transverse direction could prolong the maintenance life of flexible and semi-rigid pavements by 0.041 and 0.530 years, respectively. According to Carsim and Trucksim vehicle simulations and multiple linear regression fitting, the relationship models of three factors, namely speed, road roughness, and comfort, showed high fitting accuracies; however, there were some differences among the models. Among the texture indexes, the arithmetic mean's height (R-a) had the greatest influence on the tire-road friction coefficient; R-a greatly influenced the safe driving of AVs. The findings of this study were used to present a speed control strategy for AVs based on the roughness and texture index for ensuring comfort and safety during automatic driving.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are submersible underwater vehicles controlled by onboard computers. AUV formation is a cooperative control which focuses on controlling multiple AUVs to move in a group while executing tasks. In contrast to a single AUV, multi-AUV formation represents higher efficiency and better stability for many applications, such as oil and gas industries, hydrographic surveys, and military missions, etc. To achieve better formation, there are several key factors, including AUV performance, formation control, and communication capability. However, most studies in the field of AUV formation mainly focus on formation control methods. We observe that the research of communication capability and AUV performance of multiple AUV formation is still in an early stage. It is beneficial to researchers to present a comprehensive survey of the state of the art of AUV formation research and development. In this paper, we study AUV, formation control, and underwater acoustic communication capability in detail. We propose a classification framework with three dimensions, including AUV performance, formation control, and communication capability. This framework provides a comprehensive classification method for future AUV formation research. It also can be used to compare different methods and help engineers choose suitable formation methods for various applications. Moreover, our survey discusses formation architecture with communication constraints and we identify some common misconceptions and questionable research for formation control related to communication.

AB The development of research in robotics in a developing country is a challenging task. Factors such as low research funds, low trust from local companies and the government, and a small number of qualified researchers hinder the development of strong, local research groups. In this article, and as a case of study, we present our research group in robotics at the Advanced Mining Technology Center of the Universidad de Chile, and the way in which we have addressed these challenges. In 2008, we decided to focus our research efforts in mining, which is the main industry in Chile. We observed that this industry has needs in terms of safety, productivity, operational continuity, and environmental care. All these needs could be addressed with robotics and automation technology. In a first stage, we concentrate ourselves in building capabilities in field robotics, starting with the automation of a commercial vehicle. An important outcome of this project was the earn of the local mining industry confidence. Then, in a second stage started in 2012, we began working with the local mining industry in technological projects. In this article, we describe three of the technological projects that we have developed with industry support: (i) an autonomous vehicle for mining environments without global positioning system coverage; (ii) the inspection of the irrigation flow in heap leach piles using unmanned aerial vehicles and thermal cameras; and (iii) an enhanced vision system for vehicle teleoperation in adverse climatic conditions.

AB In this paper, an asymmetric dual winding three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) is proposed for enhancing the fault-tolerance of overheat in autonomous vehicles. A conventional dual winding three-phase motor is divided into two three-phase windings, one for the master part and one for the slave part. It is advantageous to have a redundant system by combining two electric control units (ECU) with one motor instead of two motors. However, when the motor is burned out due to excessive overload driving beyond the motor design value, there is a possibility that no operation can be performed even though there are two ECUs. The proposed dual winding three-phase asymmetric motors are designed differently in the master and slave windings so that the simultaneous burnout of master and slave can be avoided. The coil temperature rise according to the asymmetrical winding design of the motor is estimated by the thermal equivalent circuit method. Also, optimal design for proposed model is conducted using the radial basis function (RBF) and the experimental design method. The optimized proposed asymmetric dual winding three-phase PMSM is applied to the design of motor for electric brake systems of an autonomous vehicle and is verified its usefulness.

AB The deployment of autonomous buses (AB) is expected to have consequences for service design facilitated by its cost function structure. We study the impacts of AB deployment in line-based public transport (PT) systems. In particular, we examine the transition phase where AB is sequentially deployed, involving the selection of lines for which AB will be introduced. To this end, we develop a modeling framework using a dynamic public transportation assignment and operations simulation model that captures users' adaptive path choices. An analytical model is used to determine the initial solutions in terms of service frequency and vehicle capacity for the simulation framework. Due to their different cost function structures, the deployment of AB may be accompanied by changes in the service frequency and vehicle capacity settings and consequently also on passenger flow distribution across the network. Both the simultaneous and the sequential deployment of AB on multiple lines are investigated. Deployment solutions are assessed in terms of the both total operator and user cost. The decision variables are vehicle capacity per line, service frequency per line and vehicle technology per line - i.e. either manually driven or fully automated buses. The framework is applied to a case study in Kista, Stockholm. The study shows that AB service have the potential to attract passengers through improved service provision. A sensitivity analysis is carried out concerning the effects of different cost parameters and demand levels on the deployment of AB in fixed line operations.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are emerging with enormous potentials to solve many challenging road traffic problems. The AV emergence leads to a paradigm shift in the road traffic system, making the penetration of autonomous vehicles fast and its coexistence with human-driven cars inevitable. The migration from the traditional driving to the intelligent driving system with AV's gradual deployment needs supporting technology to address mixed traffic systems problems, mixed driving behaviour in a car-following model, variation in-vehicle type control means, the impact of a proportion of AV in traffic mixed traffic, and many more. The migration to fully AV will solve many traffic problems: desire to reclaim travel and commuting time, driving comfort, and accident reduction. Motivated by the above facts, this paper presents an extensive review of road intersection mixed traffic management techniques with a classification matrix of different traffic management strategies and technologies that could effectively describe a mix of human and autonomous vehicles. It explores the existing traffic control strategies and analyses their compatibility in a mixed traffic environment. Then review their drawback and build on it for the proposed robust mix of traffic management schemes. Though many traffic control strategies have been in existence, the analysis presented in this paper gives new insights to the readers on the applications of the cell reservation strategy in a mixed traffic environment. Though many traffic control strategies have been in existence, the Gipp's car-following model has shown to be very effective for optimal traffic flow performance.

AB Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) hold great promise for improving transportation safety and efficiency. However, the development of these technologies requires a robust and systematic engineering process to ensure their reliable and safe operation in various traffic situations. In this letter, we present a scenario-based systems engineering for the development and test of advanced driver assistance systems, drawing insights from a real automotive proving ground. This letter is the second part of Decentralized and Hybrid Workshop (DHW) on Scenarios Engineering (SE), which aims to improve scenario diversity and representation for advanced driver assistance systems. The article proposes a 5-layer scenario architecture and also describes several key tasks that must be addressed in the ADAS, such as lane keeping assistance (LSK), adaptive cruise control (ACC) and autonomous emergency braking (AEB). Additionally, we elaborate on the testing challenges that the aforementioned tasks entail. Finally, we employ clustering methods to obtain 9 crucial scenarios of LKA, which can be utilized for ADAS testing.

AB The deployment of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) poses considerable challenges and unique opportunities for the design and management of future urban road infrastructure. In light of this disruptive transformation, the Right-Of-Way (ROW) composition of road space has the potential to be renewed. Design approaches and intelligent control models have been proposed to address this problem, but we lack an operational framework that can dynamically generate ROW plans for AVs and pedestrians in response to real-time demand. Based on microscopic traffic simulation, this study explores Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods for evolving ROW compositions. We implement a centralised learning paradigm and a distributive learning paradigm to separately perform the dynamic control on several road network configurations. Experimental results indicate that the algorithms have the potential to improve traffic flow efficiency and allocate more space for pedestrians. Furthermore, the distributive learning algorithm outperforms its centralised counterpart regarding computational cost (49.55%), benchmark rewards (25.35%), best cumulative rewards (24.58%), optimal actions (13.49%) and rate of convergence. This novel road management technique could potentially contribute to the flow-adaptive and active mobility-friendly streets in the AVs era.

AB In leader-following formation, the leader plays a central role and is more vulnerable to malicious attacks. To effectively protect the leader, this article investigates an event-based formation control problem of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) with multiple attackers and actuator failure. A novel adaptive formation keeping and interception scheme is developed for ASVs. In this scheme, a formation keeping controller and an interception controller are designed under a unified framework by sharing same event-triggered mechanism and fault-tolerant structure. To bridge these two controllers, a degree and distance driven formation interception ((DFI)-F-3) strategy is designed by generating defenders. It is shown that with the proposed scheme, all attackers are intercepted without affecting formation keeping of remaining ASVs if the original topology is connected. Advantages of our scheme are: 1) stable controller switching is ensured during the formation cooperation and 2) the fault-tolerance is obtained with lower actuator updating frequencies and least number of adaptive parameters for each ASV.

ID HIGHLY AUTOMATED VEHICLES
AB In the context of autonomous driving, where humans may need to take over in the event where the computer may issue a takeover request, a key step towards driving safety is the monitoring of the hands to ensure the driver is ready for such a request. This work, focuses on the first step of this process, which is to locate the hands. Such a system must work in real-time and under varying harsh lighting conditions. This article introduces a fast ConvNet approach, based on the work of original work of OpenPose by Cao, et al. for full body joint estimation. The network is modified with fewer parameters and retrained using our own day-time naturalistic autonomous driving dataset to estimate joint and affinity heatmaps for driver and passenger's wrist and elbows, for a total of 8 joint classes and part affinity fields between each wrist-elbowpair. The approach runs real-time on real-world data at 40 fps on multiple drivers and passengers. The system is extensively evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively, showing at least 95% detection performance on joint localization and arm-angle estimation.

AB A robust neural network approximation-based output-feedback tracking controller is proposed for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in six degrees-of-freedom in this paper. The prescribed performance technique is employed to obtain some pre-defined maximum overshoot/undershoot, convergence speed and ultimate tracking accuracy for the tracking errors. A high-gain observer is used to approximate unavailable velocity vector which is crucial to design the output-feedback controller. A robust multi-layer neural network and adaptive robust techniques are combined to simultaneously compensate for the unmodeled dynamics, system nonlinearities, exogenous kinematic and dynamic disturbances, and reduce the risk of the actuator saturation. Then, the uniform ultimate boundedness stability of the closed-loop control system is proved via a Lyapunov-based stability synthesis. It is demonstrated that the posture tracking errors converge to a vicinity of the origin with a guaranteed prescribed performance during the tracking mission without velocity measurements. Finally, simulation results with a comparative study verify the theoretical findings.

ID SATURATION; SYSTEMS; ALLOCATION; PATHS
AB A region tracking fault tolerant control approach based on backstepping technique is proposed for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV). The proposed approach aims at driving tracking error to reach into the desired region in presence of ocean current disturbance, modelling uncertainty, unknown thruster faults and thruster amplitude and rate saturation constraints. At first, a type of piecewise and differential Lyapunov function is constructed to achieve region tracking control in the frame of backstepping technique. Then, the paper analyses and acquires the bound structures of the lumped uncertainty (including ocean current disturbance and model uncertainty) and the variation of thruster distribution matrix caused by unknown thruster faults, respectively. An adaptive technique is used to estimate the unknown coefficients in the above bound structures. In addition, an adaptive adjustment scheme for the desired trajectory is developed to achieve region tracking control with thruster amplitude and rate saturation constraints. The stability of the closed-loop system is analysed based on Barbalat's lemma. Finally, simulations and pool-experiments are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Autonomous vehicles rely on lane-level high-definition (HD) maps for self-localization and trajectory planning. Current mapping, however, relies on simple line models, while clothoid curves have unexplored potential. Clothoids, well known in road design, are often chosen to model the vehicle trajectory in planning and control systems as they describe the road with higher fidelity. For this reason, we propose two vision-based pipelines for generating lane-level HD maps using clothoid models. The first pipeline performs mapping with known poses, requiring precise real-time kinematics GPS (RTK GPS) measurements; the second copes with noisy localizations, solving the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem. Both pipelines rely on a line detection algorithm to identify each line marking and perform a graph-based optimization to estimate the map.

AB This paper addresses the three-dimensional tracking and stabilization problems simultaneously for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) subjected to parametric uncertainties, external disturbances, unmeasured states and input saturation. A modified error state formulation is introduced to produce auxiliary virtual controls for the underactuated kinematics. A new high-gain observer is proposed to estimate unavailable velocities which doesn't need the position and orientation of AUVs to be bounded. Based on the backstepping technique and combinations of high-gain observer and radial-basis-function neural network (RBFNN) approximations, the kinematic and dynamic controllers are designed to force underactuated AUVs to track a timevarying trajectory or/and a stationary point, and guarantees the tracking errors convergent to a bounded neighborhood of the origin. Some comparative simulations are presented to validate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed control scheme.

ID ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; RELAXATION
AB This paper proposes a theoretical framework to control a platoon of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in the presence of cut-in movements. The control method is developed based on the spring-mass-damper (SMD) system concept and aims to improve the platoon efficiency and stability after a cut-in movement (e.g., lane change and merging from on-ramp). The method seeks to resolve a disturbance created by a cut-in vehicle by systematically setting two control parameters, spring constant and damping coefficient, of the SMD-based control model based on the prevailing traffic conditions. The control method is evaluated through a simulation based on the changes in speed and spacing, recovery time to reach the desired speed, disturbance propagation, and platoon flow. The simulation result shows that the control method can effectively reduce the disturbance caused by a cut-in movement and improve platoon flow.

AB The age of algorithms is here, and it is really changing people's lives. More and more ethical problems related to algorithms have attracted people's attention, but the related ethical research is still far behind the research of algorithms. As more intelligent algorithms emerge in an endless stream, there will also be a lot of algorithmic ethical issues. On the other hand, with the continuous improvement of the development level of the automobile industry, people have a stronger demand for the safety and stability of modern transportation, and more and more autonomous driving technology has been promoted and applied in the market. At present, most of the studies on the longitudinal collision avoidance system of vehicles use collision warning or emergency braking to avoid collision. However, when the vehicle is in a special situation such as high speed and slippery road, emergency steering is more effective. In order to further improve the vehicle safety and ethical algorithm design points, this article revolves around vehicle lateral active collision avoidance control method research, the collision avoidance decision-making, and path planning and collision avoidance transverse vehicle longitudinal motion control is analyzed, and based on automated driving simulation experiment, the tests carried out to verify the designed control strategy. The experimental results show that the proposed method not only has a good effect of preventing automatic driving collision but also can meet the requirements of algorithm ethics. This research can effectively guide the research of algorithmic ethics in the field of autonomous driving and effectively reduce the occurrence of traffic accidents.

AB This article presents a cooperative dynamic task assignment framework for a certain class of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) employed to control the outbreak of Crown-Of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) in Australia's Great Barrier Reef. The problem of monitoring and controlling the COTS is transcribed into a constrained task assignment problem in which eradicating clusters of COTS, by the injection system of COTSbot AUVs, is considered as a task. A probabilistic map of the operating environment, including seabed terrain, clusters of COTS, and coastlines, is constructed. Then, a novel heuristic algorithm called heuristic fleet cooperation (HFC) is developed to provide a cooperative injection of the COTSbot AUVs to the maximum possible COTS in an assigned mission time. Extensive simulation studies together with quantitative performance analysis are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed cooperative task assignment algorithm in eradicating the COTS in the Great Barrier Reef. Note to Practitioners-This research is motivated by controlling the outbreak of Crown-Of-Thorns Starfish (COTS), in Australia's Great Barrier Reef, by employing a certain class of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with the injection arm. A new evolutionary algorithm, called heuristic fleet cooperation (HFC), is designed upon a hierarchal priority evolution to facilitate a multivehicle dynamic task assignment problem. The HFC is able to rapidly prototype multiple optimal solutions for efficient grouping and accomplishment of the tasks spread over a large operation area.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are within reach of widespread deployment on public roads, but public perceptions are ambivalent. The objective of the present research was to assess expectations about the consequences of CAV introduction. These expectations should explain CAV acceptance, but their relative importance is poorly understood. We conducted a survey with a representatively drawn panel sample (N = 529) from France, Germany, Italy, and the UK. The survey consisted of a large item pool of expected consequences from CAV introduction, as well as general and affective evaluation of CAVs, ease of use, and behavioral intention to use CAVs. Exploratory factor analysis revealed four facets of expected consequences: road safety, privacy, efficiency and ecological sustainability. On average, expectations were mostly positive for ecological sustainability and safety, but negative for privacy. At the same time, substantial variance existed between respondents and between countries. For safety and efficiency, improvement was expected by a third of respondents, while another third expected worsening. Respondents from Italy expected more positive consequences for safety, while respondents from both France and Germany expected more negative consequences for privacy. To different degrees, all four facets predicted the intention to use CAVs in a structural equation model, primarily via affective evaluations. For policy makers, manufacturers, and service providers, understanding the trade-offs inherent to different CAV solutions will be central to ensure citizens' needs are respected.

AB This paper investigates the lane keeping control for four-wheel independently actuated autonomous vehicles. To guarantee the vehicle safety when the active-steering motor entirely fails, the steering manoeuvre is realized by the differential drive assisted steering (DDAS) that is generated by the differential moment between the front wheels. A novel adaptive multivariable super-twisting control strategy is proposed to realize the control objective in finite time, considering the multiple unknown and mismatched disturbances of the steering system with the chattering effect removed. In the sliding surface, a nonlinear function is designed to adaptively change the damping ratio of the closed-loop system so as to improve the transient performance of the lane keeping control in the faulty steering condition. The controller design has avoided the use of the lateral velocity which is usually hard to measure in practice. Instead, the lane keeping errors and their time derivatives are estimated with a high-order sliding mode observer based on a vision system. The finite-time convergence of the closed-loop system is proved by the Lyapunov method. Results of CarSim-Simulink simulations with the proposed control strategy compared with a tradition sliding mode controller based on a high-fidelity and full-car model have verified the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller in the lane keeping control via DDAS with the guaranteed high performance.

AB In this study, a single autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) aims to rendezvous with a submerged leader recovery vehicle through a cluttered and variable operating field. The rendezvous problem is transformed into a Nonlinear Optimal Control Problem (NOCP) and then numerical solutions are provided. A penalty function method is utilized to combine the boundary conditions, vehicular and environmental constraints with the performance index that is final rendezvous time. Four evolutionary based path planning methods namely Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO), Differential Evolution (DE), and Firefly Algorithm (FA) are employed to establish a reactive planner module and provide a numerical solution for the proposed NOCP. The objective is to synthesize and analyze the performance and capability of the mentioned methods for guiding an AUV from an initial loitering point toward the rendezvous through a comprehensive simulation study. The proposed planner module entails a heuristic for refining the path considering situational awareness of environment, encompassing static and dynamic obstacles within a spatiotemporal current fields. The planner thus needs to accommodate the unforeseen changes in the operating field such as emergence of unpredicted obstacles or variability of current field and turbulent regions. The simulation results demonstrate the inherent robustness and efficiency of the proposed planner for enhancing a vehicle's autonomy so as to enable it to reach the desired rendezvous. The advantages and shortcoming of all utilized methods are also presented based on the obtained results. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID LOCK-IN; OPTIMIZATION
AB It is widely recognised that digital technology - and in particular dynamic ride sharing systems (DRS) - is leading to fundamental changes to vehicular transport and in particular, offers the prospect of substantially more cost effective forms of transport. A much anticipated transformational wave is that of autonomous vehicles (AVs) which carry the prospect of considerably cheaper and far more convenient individualised transport. That eventuality when married to DRS in the form of shared AVs (SAVs) - is seen as individualised transport's 'killer app' with the attendant risk of its convenience and low cost drawing clients away from public transport systems.
   To address this problem digital technology is now enabling hybrid modular transport systems (MTS) designed to act variously as a rapid (bus like) transit system, a feeder role for mass transit systems or, alternatively, a low density urban DRS service.
   In this article a road based modular DRS (MDRS) is described which is comprised of low capacity (up to 10 people) pods which can be articulated into a single vehicle or dynamically separated into individual transport units. There is, therefore, the potential when the pods are detached, to be used for off-peak low capacity last mile feeder services. When the pods are coupled together in bus length vehicles, they can act as a quasi-rapid transit system or as a feeder to them. Such a modular DRS system (MDRS) is shown to have the potential to reduce congestion through decreasing the size and number of vehicles at particular periods of the urban transport cycle. A further major increase in cost effectiveness is envisaged to be an urban based autonomous MDRS system which captures the key cost and convenience benefits of AVs and SAVs while curbing excess use of individual vehicles and abandonment of public transport.

AB Traffic crashes, heavy congestion, and discomfort often occur on rough pavements due to human drivers' imperfect decision-making for vehicle control. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) will flood onto urban roads to replace human drivers and improve driving performance in the near future. With the development of the cooperative vehicle infrastructure system (CVIS), multi-source road and traffic information can be collected by onboard or roadside sensors and integrated into a cloud. The information is updated and used for decision-making in real-time. This study proposes an intelligent speed control approach for AVs in CVISs using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to improve safety, efficiency, and ride comfort. First, the irregular and fluctuating road profiles of rough pavements are represented by maximum comfortable speeds on segments via vertical comfort evaluation. A DRL-based speed control model is then designed to learn safe, efficient, and comfortable car-following behavior based on road and traffic information. Specifically, the model is trained and tested in a stochastic environment using data sampled from 1341 car-following events collected in California and 110 rough pavements detected in Shanghai. The experimental results show that the DRL-based speed control model can improve computational efficiency, driving efficiency, longitudinal comfort, and vertical comfort in cars by 93.47%, 26.99%, 58.33%, and 6.05%, respectively, compared to a model predictive control-based adaptive cruise control. The results indicate that the proposed intelligent speed control approach for AVs is effective on rough pavements and has excellent potential for practical application.

AB Excessive dependence on autonomous vehicles (AVs) may exacerbate traffic congestion and increase exhaust emissions in the future. The diffusion of AVs may be significantly affected by the public's acceptance. A few factors that may affect people's acceptance of AVs have been researched in the existing studies, one-third of which cited behavioral theories, while the rest did not. A total of seven factors with behavior theories are screened out that significantly affect the acceptance intention, including perceived ease of use, attitude, social norm, trust, perceived usefulness, perceived risk, and compatibility. Six factors without behavior theories are summed up that affect AV acceptance, namely safety, performance-to-price value, mobility, value of travel time, symbolic value, and environmentally friendly. We found that people in Europe and Asia have substantial differences in attitudes toward AVs and that safety is one of the most concerned factors of AVs by scholars and respondents. Public acceptance of the different types of AVs and consumers' dynamic preferences for AVs are highlighted in the review too. The quality of literature is systematically assessed based on previously established instruments and tailored for the current review. The results of the assessment show potential opportunities for future research, such as the citation of behavior theories and access to longitudinal data. Additionally, the experimental methods and the utilization of mathematical and theoretical methods could be optimized.

AB In this work, We examine the problem of constructing and maintaining a map of an autonomous vehicle's environment for the purpose of navigation, using evidential reasoning. The inherent uncertainty in the origin of measurements of sensors demands a probabilistic approach to processing, or fusing, the new sensory information to build an accurate map.
   In this paper, the map is based on a two-dimensional (2-D) occupancy grid. The sensor readings are "fused" into the map using the Dempster-Shafer inference rule. This evidential approach with its multivalued hypotheses allows quantitative analysis of the quality of the data. The map building system is experimentally evaluated using sonar data from real environments.

AB Trust and confidence in autonomous behavior is required to send autonomous vehicles into operational missions. The authors introduce the Performance Evaluation and Review Framework Of Robotic Missions (PERFORM), a framework to enable a rigorous and replicable autonomy test environment, thereby filling the void between that of merely simulating autonomy and that of completing true field missions. A generic architecture for defining the missions under test is proposed and a unique Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic approach is used as the foundation for the mathematically rigorous autonomy evaluation framework. The test environment is designed to aid in (1) new technology development (i.e., providing direct comparisons and quantitative evaluations between autonomy algorithms), (2) the validation of the performance of specific autonomous platforms, and (3) the selection of the appropriate robotic platform(s) for a given mission type (e.g., for surveying, surveillance, search and rescue). Three case studies are presented to apply the metric to various test scenarios. Results demonstrate the flexibility of the technique with the ability to tailor tests to the user's design requirements accounting for different priorities related to acceptable risks and goals of a given mission.

AB Nowadays, with highly developed instrumentation, sensing and actuation technologies, it is possible to foresee an important advance in the field of autonomous and/or semi-autonomous transportation systems. Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) have been subjected to very active research for many years, and Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is one area of major interest. Among the most promising transport infrastructures, the articulated bus is an interesting, low cost, high occupancy capacity and friendly option. In this paper, an experimental platform for research on the automatic control of an articulated bus is presented. The aim of the platform is to allow full experimentation in real conditions for testing technological developments and control algorithms. The experimental platform consists of a mobile component (a commercial articulated bus) fully instrumented and a ground test area composed of asphalt roads inside the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC) premises. This paper focuses also on the development of a human machine interface to ease progress in control system evaluation. Some experimental results are presented in order to show the potential of the proposed platform.

AB Based on the characteristics of electric vehicles (EVs), this paper establishes the load models of EVs under the autonomous charging mode and the coordinated charging and discharging mode. Integrating the EVs into a microgrid system which includes wind turbines (WTs), photovoltaic arrays (PVs), diesel engines (DEs), fuel cells (FCs) and a storage battery (BS), this paper establishes multi-objective economic dispatch models of a microgrid, including the lowest operating cost, the least carbon dioxide emissions, and the lowest pollutant treatment cost. After converting the multi-objective functions to a single objective function by using the judgment matrix method, we analyze the dynamic economic dispatch of the microgrid system including vehicle-to-grid (V2G) with an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm under different operation control strategies. With the example system, the proposed models and strategies are verified and analyzed. Simulation results show that the microgrid system with EVs under the coordinated charging and discharging mode has better operation economics than the autonomous charging mode. Meanwhile, the greater the load fluctuation is, the higher the operating cost of the microgrid system is.

AB This paper examines whether ecological speed information describing ongoing driving maneuvers during automated driving enhances the hedonic quality and driving safety immediately after a driving takeover. Visualizing maneuvers and trajectories has already proven effective. However, planned acceleration and deceleration in an automated vehicle have not yet been investigated. Therefore, this paper assesses how an automated vehicle's speed control information might be presented by an ecological interface. Besides a possible increase in the hedonic quality, this information might enhance safe behavior of the human driver when it comes to a takeover. To assess these two aspects, 43 drivers participated in a dynamic driving simulator study. Using a within-subject design, two scenarios were used to compare an ecological interface, dynamically visualizing speed changes, to a conventional pop-up interface, using pop-up icons to visualize speed changes. The experimental results indicate that ecological feedback and conventional pop-up feedback do not differ regarding the hedonic quality, which was reflected by the state anxiety, usefulness, and satisfaction with the overall human-machine interface (HMI). Nonetheless, the post-hoc questionnaire on situational awareness showed a significantly lower rating for the ecological interface which may be the result of a more automatic and subconscious processing of the information given. Analyzing the takeover performance, the initial takeover time was comparably low for both interfaces. However, concerning safety, the ecological interface significantly enhanced the lateral control after takeover, and the drivers looked at the vehicle mirrors significantly earlier. In conclusion, the results show that the information given by the ecological interface may help drivers cope with a sudden takeover in a faster and more controlled way. Future applications of these findings might serve to enhance the acceptance and safety of semi-autonomous vehicles by implementing ecological interfaces. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Higher standards for reliability and efficiency apply to the connection between vehicle terminals and infrastructure by the fifth-generation mobile communication technology (5G). A vehicle-to-infrastructure system uses a communication system called NR-V2I (New Radio-Vehicle to Infrastructure), which uses Link Adaptation (LA) technology to communicate in constantly changing V2I to increase the efficacy and reliability of V2I information transmission. This paper proposes a Double Deep Q-learning (DDQL) LA scheduling algorithm for optimizing the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) of autonomous driving vehicles in V2I communication. The problem with the Doppler shift and complex fast time-varying channels reducing the reliability of information transmission in V2I scenarios is that they make it less likely that the information will be transmitted accurately. Schedules for autonomous vehicles using Space Division Multiplexing (SDM) and MCS are used in V2I communications. To address the issue of Deep Q-learning (DQL) overestimation in the Q-Network learning process, the approach integrates Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Double Q-Network (DDQN). The findings of this study demonstrate that the suggested algorithm can adapt to complex channel environments with varying vehicle speeds in V2I scenarios and by choosing the best scheduling scheme for V2I road information transmission using a combination of MCS. SDM not only increases the accuracy of the transmission of road safety information but also helps to foster cooperation and communication between vehicle terminals to realize cooperative driving.

AB The development of connected and automated driving functions involves that the interaction of autonomous/automated vehicles with the surrounding environment will increase. Accordingly, there is a necessity for an improvement in the usage of traditional tools of the automotive development process. This is a critical problem since the classic development process used in the automotive field uses a very simplified driver model and the traffic environment, while nowadays it should contemplate a realistic representation of these elements. To overcome this issue, the authors proposed an integrated simulation environment, based on the co-simulation of Matlab/Simulink environment with simulation of urban mobility, which allows for a realistic model of vehicle dynamic, control logics, driver behaviour and traffic conditions. Simulation tests have been performed to prove the reasoning for such a tool, and to show the capabilities of the instrument. By using the proposed platform, vehicles may be modelled with a higher level of details (with respect to microscopic simulators), while the autonomous/automated driving functions can be tested in realistic traffic scenarios where the features of the road traffic environment can be varied to verify in a realistic way the level of robustness of the on-board implemented functions.

AB Robust and precise vehicle detection is the prerequisite for decision-making and motion planning in autonomous driving. Vehicle detection algorithms follow three steps: ground segmentation, obstacle clustering and bounding box fitting. The ground segmentation result directly affects the input of the subsequent obstacle clustering algorithms. Aiming at the problems of over-segmentation and under-segmentation in traditional ground segmentation algorithms, a ground segmentation algorithm based on Gaussian process is proposed in this paper. To ensure accurate search of real ground candidate points as training data for Gaussian process, the proposed algorithm introduces the height and slope criteria, which is more reasonable than the use of fixed height threshold for searching. After that, a sparse covariance function is introduced as the kernel function for calculation in Gaussian process. This function is more suitable for ground segmentation situation the radial basis function (RBF). The proposed algorithm is tested on our autonomous driving experimental platform and the public autonomous driving dataset KITTI, compared with the most used RANSAC algorithm and ray ground filter algorithm. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm can avoid obvious over-segmentation and under-segmentation. In addition, compared with the RBF, the introduction of the sparse covariance function also reduces the computation time by 37.26%.

AB Autonomous driving is one of the fastest developing fields of robotics. With the ever-growing interest in autonomous driving, the ability to provide robots with both efficient and safe navigation capabilities is of paramount significance. With the continuous development of automation technology, higher levels of autonomous driving can be achieved with vision-based methodologies. Moreover, materials handling in industrial assembly lines can be performed efficiently using automated guided vehicles (AGVs). However, the visual perception of industrial environments is complex due to the existence of many obstacles in pre-defined routes. With the INDTECH 4.0 project, we aim to develop an autonomous navigation system, allowing the AGV to detect and avoid obstacles based in the processing of depth data acquired with a frontal depth camera mounted on the AGV. Applying the RANSAC (random sample consensus) and Euclidean clustering algorithms to the 3D point clouds captured by the camera, we can isolate obstacles from the ground plane and separate them into clusters. The clusters give information about the location of obstacles with respect to the AGV position. In experiments conducted outdoors and indoors, the results revealed that the method is very effective, returning high percentages of detection for most tests.

AB Operational risk management of autonomous vehicles in extreme environments is heavily dependent on expert judgments and, in particular, judgments of the likelihood that a failure mitigation action, via correction and prevention, will annul the consequences of a specific fault. However, extant research has not examined the reliability of experts in estimating the probability of failure mitigation. For systems operations in extreme environments, the probability of failure mitigation is taken as a proxy of the probability of a fault not reoccurring. Usinga prioriexpert judgments for an autonomous underwater vehicle mission in the Arctic anda posteriorimission field data, we subsequently developed a generalized linear model that enabled us to investigate this relationship. We found that the probability of failure mitigation alone cannot be used as a proxy for the probability of fault not reoccurring. We conclude that it is also essential to include the effort to implement the failure mitigation when estimating the probability of fault not reoccurring. The effort is the time taken by a person (measured in person-months) to execute the task required to implement the fault correction action. We show that once a modicum of operational data is obtained, it is possible to define a generalized linear logistic model to estimate the probability a fault not reoccurring. We discuss how our findings are important to all autonomous vehicle operations and how similar operations can benefit from revising expert judgments of risk mitigation to take account of the effort required to reduce key risks.

AB Currently, individual animal movement data can be obtained using a variety of methods, but each methodology is limited in either temporal or spatial resolution. A new method of active tracking was developed which utilizes autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) equipped with stereo-hydrophones that can accurately estimate the position of a moving acoustic tag, while remaining at a distance. This technology was tested and compared to standard human-based active tracking technology to understand the benefits and limitations of this new technique. An AUV and a researcher independently tracked stationary and moving targets of known location in order to compare their spatial and temporal accuracy. Both methods were then used to track a leopard shark, Triakis semifasciata, in the field. The autonomous vehicle accurately positioned both stationary and moving tags with a positional error of <10 m. For stationary transmitters, the AUV and the researcher were comparable, but when tracking moving transmitters, the AUV had significantly better spatial accuracy. Throughout all trials, the AUV had a higher frequency of accurate location estimates than a researcher actively tracking. Based on these findings, the AUV was able to more accurately track and record the position of an acoustically tagged shark in the field. Using this new technology, researchers should be able to maintain or improve the spatial resolution of measurements when actively tracking acoustically tagged individuals and will be able to increase the temporal resolution of measurements while minimizing the potential influence of tracking on the behavior of the animal.

TI Making Bertha See Even More: Radar Contribution

DE Radar; automotive radar; autonomous driving
AB For decades, radar has been applied extensively in warfare, earth observation, rain detection, and industrial applications. All those areas are characterized by requirements such as high quality of service, reliability, robustness in harsh environment and short update time for environmental perception, and even imaging tasks. In the vehicle safety and driver assistance field, radars have found widespread application globally in nearly all vehicle brands. With the market introduction of the 2014 Mercedes-Benz S-Class vehicle equipped with six radar sensors covering the vehicles environment 360 in the near (up to 40 m) and far range (up to 200 m), autonomous driving has become a reality even in low-speed highway scenarios. A large azimuth field of view, multimodality and a high update rate have been the key innovations on the radar side. One major step toward autonomous driving was made in August 2013. A Mercedes-Benz research S-Class vehicle referred to at Mercedes as Bertha drove completely autonomously for about 100 km from Mannheim to Pforzheim, Germany. It followed the well-known historic Bertha Benz Memorial Route. This was done on the basis of one stereo vision system, comprising several long and short range radar sensors. These radars have been modified in Doppler resolution and dramatically improved in their perception capabilities. The new algorithms consider that urban scenarios are characterized by significantly shorter reaction and observation times, shorter mean free distances, a 360 interaction zone, and a large variety of object types to be considered. This paper describes the main challenges that Daimler radar researchers faced and their solutions to make Bertha see.

AB The cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) sidelink technology, specified in the long-term evolution (LTE) and further improved in the 5G new radio (NR) standards to facilitate direct data exchange between vehicles, will play a crucial role in revolutionizing transportation systems. However, the demand for very high reliability and ultralow latency services especially challenges the sidelink resource allocation mechanism when performed by distributed vehicles, in the so-called autonomous mode. One of the major causes of -performance degradation is the resource allocation mechanism, which was designed for orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and can generate interference and collisions under high load conditions. In this context, here we argue in favor of the use of non-OMA (NOMA) as a game changer for the sidelink in the upcoming 6G V2X, and the purpose of this article is to provide a reference for further intriguing studies in the field. Additionally, the gain achievable over conventional allocation schemes by enabling NOMA through the use of successive interference cancelation (SIC) at the receiver is measured through realistic simulations conducted when considering the latest C-V2X specifications.

AB Autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) have garnered increasing attention in recent years as they hold significant promise for transforming the transportation sector. However, despite advances in the field, effective vehicle drive control remains a critical challenge that must be addressed to realize the full potential of AEVs. This study presents a novel approach to AEV drive control for concurrently generating a suitable speed profile and controlling the vehicle drive speed along a planned path that takes into account various driving circumstances that mimic real-world driving. The designed strategy is divided into two parts: The first part presents a proposed speed planning algorithm (SPA) that works on developing an adequate speed profile for vehicle navigation; first, the algorithm uses an approach for identifying sharp curves on the predefined trajectory; secondly, based on the dynamic properties of these curves, it generates an appropriate speed profile to ensure smooth vehicle travel across the entire trajectory with varying velocities. The second part proposes a new back-stepping control technique with a space vector modulation (SVM) strategy to control the speed of an induction motor (IM) as a traction part of the AEV. A load torque observer has been designed to enhance the speed-tracking task, while the system stability has been proven using Lyapunov theory. Through a series of experiments and simulations using MATLAB/Simulink software and the dSPACE 1104 real-time interface, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the SPA combined with the back-stepping control technique and highlight its potential to advance the field of AEV technology. Our findings have important implications for the design and implementation of AEVs and provide a foundation for future research in this exciting area of study.

AB In this study we aim to identify how the adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs) affects the value of travel time savings (VOTTS) for commuting trips under different trip distance scenarios (local and inter-city travel). Using a stated preference survey administered to Korean commuters in 2019, two multinomial logit (MNL) mode choice models are developed. These models are stratified by trip length and include four alternatives: AV with a manual driving option (AVMD), AV with a self-driving option (AVSD), shared AV (SAV), and public transit (PT). The results show that the value of in-vehicle travel time savings for AVSD (on average, $7.61/hr) is lower than for the other two AV modes (AVMD = $10.26/hr, SAV = $13.67/hr). It suggests that travelers tend to pay less to reduce travel time while using a private hands-free mode because it allows travelers to use their travel time more productively and/or relieve stress for driving. In addition, changes in the VOTTS for each mode vary by trip length. As travel distance increases, VOTTS for shared modes (SAV and PT) tends to decrease. The value of in-vehicle travel time for SAV in the local travel scenario is the highest among the four modes but is considerably lower than that in the inter-city scenario. These differences suggest that travelers require a certain amount of time to fully use their in-vehicle time, highlighting the importance of trip length when determining the VOTTS. Interestingly, the VOTTS for PT is lower than three AV modes, implying that it might be too early to expect substantial reduction in the VOTTS for AVs due to potential risks of accidents, unfamiliarity with AVs, or immature technology of AVs.

AB In military applications, underwater vehicles do not communicate with each other. They use sonar systems to detect enemy vehicles that are trying hard not to make any sound or noise. In autonomous/unmanned underwater vehicles (AUVs, UUVs), sonar systems are usually employed to detect or avoid underwater obstacles. With the emergence of sQuba, a new breed of car that can be driven both on land and underwater, we explore a new sonar problem. How can an underwater moving vehicle verify the location of senders? As conventional sonar techniques are not appropriate for our purpose, we present a hybrid sonar algorithm that can help underwater vehicles locate target vehicles.

ID ROUTING PROBLEM
AB This paper investigates the task assignment problem for a team of autonomous aerial/marine vehicles driven by constant thrust and maneuvering in a planar lateral drift field. The aim is to minimize the total traveling time in order to guide the vehicles to deliver a number of customized sensors to a set of target points with different sensor demands in the drift field. To solve the problem, we consider together navigation strategies and target assignment algorithms; the former minimizes the traveling time between two given locations in the drift field and the latter allocates a sequence of target locations to each vehicle. We first consider the effect of the weight of the carried sensors on the speed of each vehicle, and construct a sufficient condition to guarantee that the whole operation environment is reachable for the vehicles. Then from optimal control principles, time optimal path planning is carried out to navigate each vehicle from an initial position to its given target location. Most importantly, to assign the targets to the vehicles, we combine the virtual coding strategy, multiple offspring method, intermarriage crossover strategy, and the tabu search mechanism to obtain a co-evolutionary multi-population genetic algorithm, short-named CMGA. Simulations on sensor delivery scenarios in both fixed and time-varying drift fields are shown to highlight the satisfying performances of the proposed approach against popular greedy algorithms.

AB Consider the case where autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are deployed to monitor a 3D underwater environment. This paper tackles the problem of guiding all AUVs to the destination while not colliding with a priori unknown 3D obstacles. Suppose that among all AUVs, only the leader AUV has an ability of locating itself, while accessing a destination location. A follower, an AUV that is not a leader, has no sensors for locating itself. Every follower can only measure the relative position of its neighbor AUVs utilizing its sonar sensors. Our paper addresses distributed controls, so that multiple followers track the leader while preserving communication connectivity. We design controls, so that all AUVs reach the destination safely, while maintaining connectivity in cluttered 3D environments. To the best of our knowledge, our article is novel in developing 3D underwater guidance controls, so that all AUVs equipped with sonar sensors are guided to reach a destination in a priori unknown cluttered environments. MATLAB simulations are used to validate the proposed guidance scheme in underwater environments with many obstacles.

ID OPTIMIZATION; PATH
AB In this paper, we present an effective online planning solution for autonomous vehicles that aims at improving the computational load while preserving high levels of performance in racing scenarios. The method follows the structure of the model predictive (MP) optimal strategy where the main objective is to maximize the velocity while smoothing the dynamic behavior and fulfilling varying constraints. We focus on reformulating the non-linear original problem into a pseudo-linear problem by convexifying the objective function and reformulating the non-linear vehicle equations to be expressed in a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) form. In addition, the ability of avoiding obstacles is introduced in a simple way and with reduced computational cost.
   We test and compare the performance of the proposed strategy against its non-linear approach through simulations. We focus on testing the performance of the trajectory planning approach in a racing scenario. First, the case of free obstacles track and afterwards a scenario including static obstacles. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy by reducing the algorithm elapsed time while finding appropriate trajectories under several input/state constraints.

AB We study the problem of repositioning autonomous vehicles in a shared mobility system in order to simultaneously minimize the unsatisfied demand and the total operating cost. We first present a mixed integer linear programming formulation for the deterministic version of the problem. We extend this formulation to make it easier to work with in the non-deterministic setting. We then show how the travel time uncertainty can be incorporated into this extended deterministic formulation using chance-constraint programming. Finally, two new reformulations for the proposed chance-constraint program are developed. We show a critical result that the size of one of the reformulations (in terms of the number of variables and constraints) does not depend on the number of scenarios, and so it outperforms the other reformulation. Both reformulations are bi-objective mixed integer linear programs with a finite number of nondominated points and so they can be solved directly by algorithms such as the balanced box method (Boland et al. in INFORMS J Comput 27(4):735-754, 2015). A computational study demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed reformulations.

AB Sensor reliability is one of the preconditions for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) achieving their tasks successfully, and sensor fault diagnosis system has been a line of defense for AUVs miss operation. Aiming at sensor faults which may appear on AUVs, novel fault diagnosis methods corresponding to three kinds of sensor faults are proposed in this paper based on analyzing fault forms for AUV sensors. By monitoring signal gather, we diagnose sensor faults of the gathered signals keeping unchanged if there have be not sensor output data for a long time. We adopt linear smoothness to solve output vibration of the fixed position sonar. We measure velocity information by using Doppler Velocity Log to estimate position information. We judge there is a fault if their difference is greater than the given threshold value by comparing the measured value and the estimated value, and we substitute the estimated value for the measured value of the fixed position sonar. We also adopt wavelet transform to detect accident signals. Finally, sea experiments are carried out to verify the feasibility. The results prove the means are valid enough, and we can achieve fault diagnosis for AUV sensors successfully.

AB Kinematic model predictive control (MPC) is well known for its simplicity and computational efficiency for path tracking of autonomous vehicles, however, it merely works well at low speed. In addition, earlier studies have demonstrated that tracking accuracy is improved by the feedback of yaw rate, as it improves the system transients. With this in mind, it is expected that the performance of path tracking can be improved by a cascaded controller that utilizes kinematic MPC to determine desired yaw rate rather than steering angle, and uses proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control to follow the reference yaw rate. However, directly combining MPC with PID feedback control of yaw rate results in a controller with poor tracking accuracy. The simulation results show that the cascaded MPC-PID controller has relatively stable but larger error compared to classic kinematic and dynamic MPC. Based on the analysis of vehicle sideslip angle, a novel path tracking control method is proposed, which is designed using a kinematic MPC to handle the disturbances on road curvature, a PID feedback control of yaw rate to reject uncertainties and modeling errors, and a vehicle sideslip angle compensator to correct the kinematic model prediction. The proposed controller performances involving steady-state and transient response, robustness, and computing efficiency were evaluated on Carsim/Matlab joint simulation environment. Furthermore, field experiments were conducted to validate the robustness against sensor disturbances and time lag. The results demonstrate that the developed vehicle sideslip compensator is sufficient to capture steer dynamics, and the developed controller significantly improves the performance of path tracking and follows the desired path very well, ranging from low speed to high speed even at the limits of handling.

AB With the rapid deployment of the Internet of Things, where various devices are connected to communication networks, remote driving applications for Unmanned Vehicles (UVs) are attracting attention. In ad-dition to automobiles, autonomous driving technology is expected to be applied to various types of equipment, such as small vehicles equipped with surveillance cameras to monitor building internally and externally, au-tonomous vehicles that deliver office supplies, and wheelchairs. When a UV is remotely controlled, the control accuracy deteriorates due to transmis-sion delay and jitter. The accuracy must be kept high to realize UV control system by a cloud server. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of Digital Twin Computing (DTC) for path tracking control of a UV. We show the results of simulations that use transmission delay values measured on the Internet with some cloud servers. Through the results, we quantitatively clarify that application of DTC improves control accuracy on path tracking control. We also clarify that application of jitter buffer, which absorbs the transmission delay fluctuation, can further improve the accuracy.

AB The assimilation of path planning and motion control is a crucial capability for autonomous vehicles. Pure pursuit controllers are a prevalent class of path tracking algorithms for front wheel steering cars. Nonetheless, their performance is rather limited to relatively low speeds. In this paper, we propose a model predictive active yaw control implementation of pure pursuit path tracking that accommodates the vehicle's steady state lateral dynamics to improve tracking performance at high speeds. A comparative numerical analysis was under taken between the proposed strategy and the traditional pure pursuit controller scheme. Tests were conducted for three different paths at iteratively increasing speeds from 1m/s up to 20m/s. The traditional pure pursuit controller was incapable of maintaining the vehicle stable at speeds upwards of 5m/s. The results show that implementing receding horizon strategy for pure pursuit tracking improves their performance. The contribution is apparent by preserving a relatively constant controller effort and consequently maintaining vehicle stability for speeds up to 100Km/h in different scenarios. A Matlab implementation of the proposed controller and datasets of the experimental paths are provided to supplement this work.

AB This paper discusses the steering kinematics for a center-articulated mobile rebut. Several models have been recently proposed in the literature and we use experimental data to compare and validate these models, The vehicle heading response to steering command is shown to include a dominant zero due a nonholonomic constraint, and this is verified by experiments conducted using a 30-t mobile vehicle at our laboratory. Simulation results are then used to show the significance of this zero and its effect on closed-loop heading angle control.

ID TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT; USER-EQUILIBRIUM; FLOW; MODEL
AB Routing strategies under the aegis of dynamic traffic assignment have been proposed in the literature to optimize system performance. However, challenges have persisted in their deployment ability and effectiveness due to inherent strong assumptions on traveler behavior and availability of network-level real-time traffic information, and the high computational burden associated with computing network-wide flows in real-time. To address these gaps, this study proposes an incentive-based decentralized routing strategy to nudge the network performance closer to the system optimum for the context where all vehicles are connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). The strategy consists of three stages. The first stage incorporates a local route switching dynamical system to approximate the system optimal route flow in a local area based on vehicles' knowledge of local traffic information. This system is decentralized in the sense that it only updates the local route choices of vehicles in this area rather than route choices of all vehicles in the network, which circumvents the high computational burden associated with computing the flows on the entire network. The second stage optimizes the route for each CAV by considering individual heterogeneity in traveler preferences (e.g., the value of time) to maximize the utilities of all travelers in the local area. Constraints are also incorporated to ensure that these routes can achieve the approximated local system optimal flow of the first stage. The third stage leverages an expected envy-free incentive mechanism to ensure that travelers in the local area can accept the optimal routes determined in the second stage. The study analytically discusses the convergence of the local route switching dynamical system. We also show that the proposed incentive mechanism is expected individual rational and budget-balanced, which ensure that travelers are willing to participate and guarantee the balance between payments and compensations, respectively. Further, the conditions for the expected incentive compatibility of the incentive mechanism are analyzed and proved, ensuring behavioral honesty in disclosing information. Thereby, the proposed incentive-based decentralized routing strategy can enhance network performance and user satisfaction under fully connected and autonomous environments. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper describes the conception of a high level, compact, scalable, and long autonomy perception and localization system for autonomous driving applications. Our benchmark is composed of a high resolution lidar (128 channels), a stereo global shutter camera, an inertial navigation system, a time server, and an embedded computer. In addition, in order to acquire data and build multi-modal datasets, this system embeds two perception algorithms (RBNN detection, DCNN detection) and one localization algorithm (lidar-based localization) to provide real-time advanced information such as object detection and localization in challenging environments (lack of GPS). In order to train and evaluate the perception algorithms, a dataset is built from 10,000 annotated lidar frames from various drives carried out under different weather conditions and different traffic and population densities. The performances of the three algorithms are competitive with the state-of-the-art. Moreover, the processing time of these algorithms are compatible with real-time autonomous driving applications. By providing directly accurate advanced outputs, this system might significantly facilitate the work of researchers and engineers with respect to planning and control modules. Thus, this study intends to contribute to democratizing access to autonomous vehicle research platforms.

DVECS is used for testing unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) of both real and simulated worlds where interaction and cooperation of other real and simulated vehicles, obstacles, situations, conditions and disturbances in a hybrid, synthetic, virtual environment can be observed without physical intervention. This virtual system can be used to determine: (1) the optimal performance and criteria for the cooperating vehicles and its relative application; (2) the determination of the advantages and disadvantages of collaborative application tasks between multiple UUVs; and (3) the optimal communication links between the cooperating vehicles and its remote control stations. DVECS is used as a monitoring system.

AB Convoy driving, a specialized form of collaborative autonomous driving, offers a promising solution to the multifaceted challenges that transportation systems face, including traffic congestion, pollutant emissions, and the coexistence of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles on the road, resulting in mixed traffic flow. While extensive research has focused on the collective societal benefits of convoy driving, such as safety and comfort, one critical aspect that has been overlooked is the willingness of individual vehicles to participate in convoy formations. While the collective benefits are evident, individual vehicles may not readily embrace this paradigm shift without explicit tangible benefits and incentives to motivate them. Moreover, the objective of convoy driving is not solely to deliver societal benefits but also to provide incentives and reduce costs at the individual level. Therefore, this research bridges this gap by designing and modeling the societal benefits, including traffic flow optimization and pollutant emissions, and individual-level incentives necessary to promote convoy driving. We model a fundamental diagram of mixed traffic flow, considering various factors such as CAV penetration rates, coalition intensity, and coalition sizes to investigate their relationships and their impact on traffic flow. Furthermore, we model the collaborative convoy driving problem using the coalitional game framework and propose a novel utility function encompassing incentives like car insurance discounts, traffic fine reductions, and toll discounts to encourage vehicle participation in convoys. Our experimental findings emphasize the need to strike a balance between CAV penetration rate, coalition intensity, size, and speed to realize the benefits of convoy driving at both collective and individual levels. This research aims to align the interests of road authorities seeking sustainable transportation systems and individual vehicle owners desiring tangible benefits, envisioning a future where convoy driving becomes a mutually beneficial solution.

AB Using vehicles with engaged automated driving systems (ADS) ('highly automated driving', HAD) will substantially impact on future society's mobility, yet the current understanding of human psychobiology related to HAD is still limited. Hence, we synthesized evidence on the psychobiology of subjects using HAD, informing an integrative model of the psychobiology of HAD, and providing guidance for reporting future research on this topic.
   We included (non-)randomized studies assessing human peripheral biology markers of in-vehicle-users in real or simulated driving environments, using vehicles with vs. without engaged ADS, published in English until April 2018. We systematically searched Web of Science, SCOPUS, and PubMed. The search consisted of a combination of terms describing HAD and psychobiological parameters. Risk of bias was assessed regarding randomization, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other potential causes. We extracted data using predefined data fields.
   Four out of five studies included in this review (N = 194 subjects) reported associations of use of vehicles with vs. without engaged ADS with various psychobiological parameters, including heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), indicators of electrodermal activity (EDA), and masseter electromyography (EMG). Heart rate tended to be reduced during HAD along with increased EDA and EMG, with no clear indication for changes in RSA.
   We cannot exclude substantial risk of bias, among others because the status of engagement of ADS was mostly non-randomized. Yet, findings suggest that HAD goes along with tractable changes in peripheral biology. Informed by the conceptual endophenotype approach (Hellhammer et al., 2018, Psychoneuroendocrinology), we propose the Embodied Driving (EMBODD) model that describes how HAD reshapes vehicle use experience, and highlight how to make future ADS equipped vehicles successful regarding user's health. Based on the review, we suggest reporting guidelines for future research on the psychobiology of HAD.

AB Many challenges still need to be overcome in the context of autonomous vehicles. These vehicles would be over-actuated and are expected to perform coupled maneuvers. In this paper, we first discuss the development of a global coupled vehicle model, and then we outline the control strategy that we believe should be applied in the context of over-actuated vehicles. A gain-scheduled H infinity controller and an optimization-based Control Allocation algorithms are proposed. High-fidelity co-simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed control logic and the new possibilities that could offer. We expect that both car manufacturers and equipment suppliers would join forces to develop and standardize the proposed control architecture for future passenger cars.

AB Reliably predicting the motion of contestant vehicles surrounding an autonomous racecar is crucial for effective and performant ego-motion planning. Although highly expressive, deep neural networks are black-box models, making their usage challenging in this safety-critical applications of autonomous racing. On the other hand, physics-based models provide high safety guarantees for the predicted trajectory but lack accuracy. The method presented in this paper targets this trade-off. We introduce a method to predict the trajectories of opposing racecars with deep neural networks considering physical constraints to restrict the output and to improve its feasibility. We report the method's performance against an LSTM-based encoder-decoder architecture on data acquired from multi-agent racing simulations. The proposed method outperforms the baseline model in prediction accuracy and robustness. Still, it fulfills quality guarantees of smoothness and consistency of the predicted trajectory and prevents out-of-track predictions. Thus, a robust real-world application of the model with high prediction accuracy is proven. The presented model was deployed on the racecar of the Technical University of Munich for the Indy Autonomous Challenge 2021.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) being an essential component of the future smart city traffic system is a hot topic in recent years, even though it is still in its development stage. It is conceivable that in the near future, AVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) will have to co-exist in traffic systems. This is the first paper to study a mixed traffic system from a micro perspective based on the cellular automation model. In this system, by the use of sensors or mutual information exchange, each AV will have a 'foresight' and will be able to know the speeds and positions of vehicles in front of it. In the circular road scenario, we studied how the traffic capacity is influenced by the degree of foresight, the ratio of AVs to HVs, vehicle density, and the probability of random deceleration of HVs. Then we came up with the below conclusions: (a) The optimal foresight is k = 5. An AV only needs to gather the information of the 5 vehicles in front of it. (b) The two critical factors to measure the capacity of a traffic network are the critical vehicle density and the maximum average flow. When the ratio of AVs to HVs is increased, these two critical factors increase at an accelerating rate. (c) Even if a low ratio of HVs is running in the system, it will have an appreciable negative impact. An increased probability of random deceleration can expand the hysteresis loop range and reduce average flow. (d) Within a specific range of vehicle density, there is an optimal ratio of AVs at which the traffic system has the maximum average flow. This has implications in controlling the ratio of AVs. Finally, theoretical solutions of critical vehicle density are obtained by using the mean-field theory in physics. If the vehicle density is larger than these critical values, the traffic system will be in a deadlock state, and all vehicles cannot move. These formulas are crucial to controlling the density and the ratio of AVs and HVs in future intelligent traffic systems and will help to avoid large-scale traffic congestion. The above findings will have practical ramifications for precise traffic management and traffic control in a mixed AV and HVs system. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.

The musculoskeletal humanoid, which mimics the human body in detail, has redundant sensors and a flexible body structure. These characteristics are suitable for motions with complex environmental contact, and the robot is expected to sit down on the car seat, step on the acceleration and brake pedals, and operate the steering wheel with both arms. We reconsider the developed hardware and software of the musculoskeletal humanoid Musashi in the context of autonomous driving. The respective components of autonomous driving are conducted using the benefits of the hardware and software. Finally, we show that Musashi succeeded in the pedal and steering wheel operations with recognition.

DT Article
DE autonomous vehicles; trajectory prediction; query-informed; multimodal
AB In a dynamic environment, autonomous driving vehicles require accurate decision-making and trajectory planning. To achieve this, autonomous vehicles need to understand their surrounding environment and predict the behavior and future trajectories of other traffic participants. In recent years, vectorization methods have dominated the field of motion prediction due to their ability to capture complex interactions in traffic scenes. However, existing research using vectorization methods for scene encoding often overlooks important physical information about vehicles, such as speed and heading angle, relying solely on displacement to represent the physical attributes of agents. This approach is insufficient for accurate trajectory prediction models. Additionally, agents' future trajectories can be diverse, such as proceeding straight or making left or right turns at intersections. Therefore, the output of trajectory prediction models should be multimodal to account for these variations. Existing research has used multiple regression heads to output future trajectories and confidence, but the results have been suboptimal. To address these issues, we propose QINET, a method for accurate multimodal trajectory prediction for all agents in a scene. In the scene encoding part, we enhance the feature attributes of agent vehicles to better represent the physical information of agents in the scene. Our scene representation also possesses rotational and spatial invariance. In the decoder part, we use cross-attention and induce the generation of multimodal future trajectories by employing a self-learned query matrix. Experimental results demonstrate that QINET achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse motion prediction benchmark and is capable of fast multimodal trajectory prediction for multiple agents.

AB Robustly and accurately localizing vehicles in underground mines is particularly challenging due to the unavailability of GPS, variable and often poor lighting conditions, visual aliasing in long tunnels, and airborne dust and water. In this paper, we present a novel, infrastructure-less, multisensor localization method for robust autonomous operation within underground mines. The proposed method integrates with existing mine site commissioning and operation procedures and includes both an offline map-building process and an online localization algorithm. The approach combines the strengths of visual-based place recognition, LIDAR-based localization, and odometry in a particle filter fusion process. We provide an extensive experimental validation using new large data sets acquired in two operational Australian underground hard-rock mines (including a 600m-deep multilevel mine with approximately 33 km of mapping data and 7 km of vehicle localization) by actual mining vehicles during production operations. We demonstrate a significant increase in localization accuracy over prior state-of-the-art SLAM research systems and real-time operation, with processing times in the order of 10 Hz. We present results showing a mean error of 0.68 m from the Queensland Mine data set and 1.32 m from the New South Wales Mine data set and at least 86% reduction in error compared with prior state of the art. We also analyze the impact of the particle filter parameters with respect to localization accuracy. Together this study represents a new approach to positioning systems for currently deployed autonomous vehicles within underground mine environments.

AB Conventional intelligent vehicles have performance limitations owing to the short road and obstacle detection range of the installed sensors. In this study, to overcome this limitation, we tested the usability of a new conceptual autonomous emergency braking (AEB) system that employs vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication technology in the existing AEB system. To this end, a radar sensor and a driving and communication environment constituting the AEB system were simulated; the simulation was then linked by applying vehicle dynamics and control logic. The simulation results show that the collision avoidance relaxation rate of V2V communication-based AEB system was reduced compared with that of existing vehicle-mounted-sensor-based system. Thus, a method that can lower the collision risk of the existing AEB system, which uses only a sensor cluster installed on the vehicle, is realized.

AB High-precision localization in an unknown environment is the fundamental requirement of autonomous vehicle for safe advanced driving. Cooperative localization has obvious advantages in precision, fault tolerance, and flexibility compared with single-vehicle localization, which estimates the vehicle pose via fusing the multiple sources data from sensors and extra shared neighbor vehicle information available when multiple vehicles operate simultaneously. For cooperative localization, there are more than one type of error data sources that degenerate the state estimation need to be considered, such as inter-estimation correlation and innovation, observation outliers, which may exist simultaneously. Previous works usually evaluate performance under one of the error types at one time, or they do not perform well under some extreme situations where both of the above-mentioned correlation and outliers exist. This paper presents an accurate and robust iterated split covariance intersection filter (Iterated Split CIF) based cooperative localization strategy with a decentralized framework, which can ensure the performance when data sources of various error types exist at the same time. In addition, we adopt an effective point cloud registration method to obtain the cooperative relative pose estimation using mutually shared information from neighbor vehicles. A CARLA simulator based comparative study demonstrates the potential and advantage of the proposed multi-vehicle cooperative localization using Iterated Split CIF in terms of accuracy, robustness and efficiency.

AB To obtain independent navigation results for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and construct high-resolution consistent seabed maps, a particle filter-based bathymetric simultaneous localization and mapping (BSLAM) method with the mean trajectory map representation is proposed. To reduce the computational consumption, particles only keep the current estimated position of the vehicle, while all historical states of the vehicle are stored in the mean trajectory map. Using this set-up, only the weights of the particles which closed to the mean trajectory map are calculated with newly collected bathymetric data. A hierarchical clustering procedure is also discussed to identify invalid loop closures. The performance of the proposed method is validated using both the simulated data and the field data collected from sea trails. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is 50% more accurate and 50% faster than a state-of-the-art particle filter-based BSLAM method, and it has similar accuracy but 30% faster compared with a graph-based BSLAM method.

ID FAULT-DETECTION; DESIGN
AB This paper presents a fail-safe algorithm for the exteroceptive sensors of autonomous vehicles. The proposed fault diagnosis mechanism consists of three parts: (1) fault detecting by a duplication-comparison method, (2) fault isolating by possible area prediction and (3) in-vehicle sensor fail-safes. The main ideas are the usage of redundant external sensor pairs, which estimate the same target, whose results are compared to detect the fault by a modified duplication-comparison method and the novel fault isolation method using target predictions. By comparing the estimations of surrounding vehicles and the raw measurement data, the location of faults can be determined whether they are from sensors themselves or a software error. In addition, faults were isolated by defining possible areas where existing sensor coordinates could be measured, which can be predicted by using previous estimation results. The performance of the algorithm has been tested by using offline vehicle data analysis via MATLAB. Various fault injection experiments were conducted and the performance of the suggested algorithm was evaluated based on the time interval between injection and the detection of faults.

AB As analysis of imagery and other science data plays a greater role in mission execution, there is an increasing need for autonomous marine vehicles to transmit these data to the surface. Communicating imagery and full-resolution sensor readings to surface observers remains a significant challenge. Yet, without access to the data acquired by an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV), surface operators cannot fully understand the mission state of a vehicle. This paper presents an architecture capable of multihop communication across a network of underwater acoustic relays. In concert with an abstracted physical layer, CAPTURE provides an end-to-end networking solution for communicating science data from autonomous marine vehicles. Automatically selected imagery, SONAR, and time-series sensor data are progressively transmitted across multiple hops to surface operators. To incorporate human feedback, data are transmitted as a sequence of gradually improving data "previews." Operators can request arbitrarily high-quality refinement of any resource, up to an error-free reconstruction. The results of three diverse field trials on SeaBED, OceanServer, and Bluefin AUVs, with drastically different software architectures, are also presented.

ID TECHNOLOGY; ACCEPTANCE
AB The aim of this study is to explore user acceptance of semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles on a highway through the use of an interactive simulator. Participants were asked to experience driving modes with three different levels of autonomy and complete questionnaires with items selected from traditional and automotive-specific technology acceptance models. The three levels of automation included manual driving (no-automation as a baseline condition), semi-autonomous driving where drivers were able to indicate lane change decisions, and fully autonomous driving. Results indicate that within the limited experience of the interactive simulation, users grew to like the automated system as much as manual control during later portions of the study. Overall, this work suggests that the driver will quickly grow to like automated driving features and may rapidly become less anxious about the loss of control experienced.

Our "HeIpStar" enabled semi-autonomous wheelchair functions more like a personal assistant, allowing much greater user independence. When the user finds themself in an unforeseen circumstance, the "HelpStar" feature can be activated to allow a remote operator to use Virtual Reality technologies to provide helpful navigational instructions or to send commands directly to the wheelchair. This paper demonstrates the successful integration of assistive technologies that allow a person who is visually impaired and using a wheelchair to navigate through everyday environments.

AB Automated driving systems, which can take over certain dynamic driving tasks from the driver, are becoming increasingly available in commercial vehicles. One of these automated driving systems widely introduced in commercial vehicles is adaptive cruise control (ACC). This system is designed to maintain certain desired driving speeds and time headways as chosen by drivers and based on the settings available within the system. The properties and actual performance of these systems will affect the traffic flow and its stability. However, the specific properties and their workings are rarely publicly available. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to test the actual performance of a commercial ACC system under different desired speed and distance gap settings, as well as driving modes in a car-following situation. For this purpose, a pilot field test was conducted in the Netherlands in which two identical commercial vehicles equipped with ACC systems were driven simultaneously. The first vehicle was used to create a pre-specified speed profile by adapting the ACC system settings manually, whereas the second vehicle followed the lead vehicle when the ACC system was engaged to test its actual performance. The main findings indicate that the different system settings affect the car-following indicators, and system response times were found to be comparable to human response times. The eco mode was found to affect some of the car-following indicators, and it does not deteriorate safety below the safety level of driving with short headway setting in drive mode.

AB One enabler for unmanned, autonomous system operation is mission awareness. Mission awareness is composed of three components: knowledge of mission objectives, internal self-situational awareness, and external self-situational awareness. Internal self-situational awareness implies knowledge of platform health and capability. External self-situational awareness encompasses knowledge of external resources (supplies, supervisors, or collaborators) as well as threats that can affect system performance. Finally, the system must be able to translate mission objectives into actions and assess the impact of its internal and external state on its ability to execute the mission. If the combination of the internal and external state will not permit the system to achieve its mission objectives, the autonomous control system for the platform must revise the mission plan or otherwise alter the mission execution strategy to remain within current system operational limits. A key aspect of the design and implementation of the health monitoring system and the autonomous control system is knowledge representation. The health monitoring system and the control system should have a common representation of the system capabilities and behaviors as well as the interactions between critical subsystems. Another key aspect is the representation of system health in a manner that can be used by the control system to compensate for subsystem degradation. This paper describes a generic architecture for the implementation of health monitoring within a complex system, the representation of system health information, and an approach for integrating health information with autonomous control. A behavior based, autonomous intelligent control system architecture developed for autonomous underwater vehicles is used to demonstrate the integration. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are developing rapidly nowadays. In the near future, we may see human-driving vehicles (HVs) and CAVs running on the same road. The characteristics of human drivers and the interaction between HVs and CAVs, therefore, need to be further studied. All these factors will have a great impact on traffic operation. This paper aims to explore a modeling method to analyze the operation mechanism of mixed traffic flows of HVs and CAVs. Considering HV drivers' cognitive behavioral characteristics and HV-CAV interaction effects, the forward and lateral movement rules of HVs and CAVs are proposed based on the Cellular Automata model. Then the fundamental diagram, congestion degree, lane-changing frequency, and time-spatial diagram are obtained by numerical simulation. The results show that the presence of CAVs is positively related to macroscopic traffic parameters, including velocity, flow and critical density. CAVs help to relieve traffic congestion and instabilities. The congestion degree of pure CAV traffic flow is about 1/3 that of pure HV traffic flow. When the CAV penetration rate is relatively low, the interaction between HV and CAV has a significant impact on traffic operation. Specifically, when the CAV penetration rate is below 0.5 similar to 0.6, increasing the CAV penetration rate will increase the lane-changing frequency of the whole traffic flow.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, we develop a physics-based autonomous vehicle longitudinal driver model (PAVL-DM) to move an automated vehicle (AV) forward with a minimum following gap while considering safety and passenger comfort. Unlike existing driver models for longitudinal control, PAVL-DM parameters do not need to be calibrated for different traffic states, such as congested and non-congested traffic conditions. First, we present the concept, theoretical considerations and mathematical formulations of the PAVL-DM longitudinal control model for AVs. Second, we theoretically analyze the PAVL-DM model equilibria and robustness for safety assurance and string stability. Third, we present numerical analysis related to riding comfort and a dynamic minimum following gap function for each automated vehicle in a platoon while considering the safety for the automated platoon. Our analyses suggest that the PAVL-DM (i) is able to maintain safety between a subject AV and an immediate front vehicle using a newly defined safe gap function depending on the speed and reaction time of an AV; (ii) shows local stability and string stability; and (iii) provides riding comfort for a range of autonomous driving aggressiveness depending on passengers' corresponding preferences on driving pattern. In addition, we conducted a case study using a real-world dataset, which proves that an AV with the PAVL-DM model maintains a minimum following gap between a subject AV and an immediate front vehicle without compromising safety and passenger comfort.

ID PERCEPTION; VISION
AB Recent advances in artificial intelligence technology and perception components have promoted the rapid development of autonomous vehicles. However, as safety-critical software, autonomous driving systems often make wrong judgments, seriously threatening human and property safety. LiDAR is one of the most critical sensors in autonomous vehicles, capable of accurately perceiving the three-dimensional information of the environment. Nevertheless, the high cost of manually collecting and labeling point cloud data leads to a dearth of testing methods for LiDAR-based perception modules. To bridge the critical gap, we introduce MetaLiDAR, a novel automated metamorphic testing methodology for LiDAR-based autonomous driving systems. First, we propose three object-level metamorphic relations for the domain characteristics of autonomous driving systems. Next, we design three transformation modules so that MetaLiDAR can generate natural-looking follow-up point clouds. Finally, we define corresponding evaluation metrics based on metamorphic relations. MetaLiDAR automatically determines whether source and follow-up test cases meet the metamorphic relations based on the evaluation metrics. Our empirical research on five state-of-the-art LiDAR-based object detection models shows that MetaLiDAR can not only generate natural-looking test point clouds to detect 181,547 inconsistent behaviors of different models but also significantly enhance the robustness of models by retraining with synthetic point clouds.
   We introduce MetaLiDAR, to alleviate the test oracle and test case generation problems of LiDAR-based autonomous driving systems. MetaLiDAR utilizes carefully designed metamorphic relations and object-level operation methods to automatically generate natural-looking point clouds that satisfy the physical characteristics of LiDAR and reveal inconsistent behaviors of models without test oracle.image

ID SUSPENSION SYSTEMS
AB This paper proposes a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) method for path tracking control of autonomous vehicles under network-induced delays while taking into account the roll dynamics to improve both the driving safety and the passenger comfort. The steering control is directly applied to the front wheels, while the anti-roll moment is exerted by an active suspension. The asynchronous phenomenon caused by the sampling process and the time-varying vehicle speed are explicitly taken into account in the control design using a polytopic linear parameter-varying (LPV) control approach. Moreover, to avoid using costly vehicle sensors and complex control structures, a static output feedback (SOF) control scheme is considered. An effective event-triggering mechanism is also proposed to alleviate the communication burden of the vehicle networked control system. Based on augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, the control design conditions are derived to guarantee the vehicle closed-loop stability under the effects of transmission delays, event-triggered control signals and time-varying parameters. The design procedure is reformulated as an iterative optimization problem involving linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints, which can be effectively solved with available numerical solvers. The proposed event-triggered SOF controller is evaluated with the vehicle dynamics simulation software CarSim under several dynamic scenarios. A comparative study with related vehicle control results is performance to emphasize the effectiveness of the control method in terms of path tracking performance, driving safety and comfort, and data communication efficiency of the vehicle networked control system.

ID HIGH-QUALITY PATHS; MOTION; ENVIRONMENTS; GENERATION
AB This paper presents a novel optimization-based path planner that is capable of planning multiple contingency paths to directly account for uncertainties in the future trajectories of dynamic obstacles. This planner addresses the particular problem of probabilistic collision avoidance for autonomous road vehicles that are required to safely interact, in close proximity, with other vehicles with unknown intentions. The presented path planner utilizes an efficient spline-based trajectory representation and fast but accurate collision probability bounds to simultaneously optimize multiple continuous contingency paths in real time. These collision probability bounds are efficient enough for real-time evaluation, yet accurate enough to allow for practical close-proximity driving behaviors such as passing an obstacle vehicle in an adjacent lane. An obstacle trajectory clustering algorithm is also presented to enable the path planner to scale to multiple-obstacle scenarios. Simulation results show that the contingency planner allows for a more aggressive driving style than planning a single path without compromising the overall safety of the robot.

DE Autonomous vehicles (AVs); blockchain; incentive; Internet of Vehicles;
   privacy; real-time map updates
AB The high-precision maps can provide additional information on roads and conditions, which plays an important role in autonomous vehicles (AVs) navigation. Compared with the existing map update methods, the real-time map updates based on crowdsensing have lower cost and higher accuracy. However, in the process of map update, the map service platform (MSP) cannot recruit enough vehicle users to obtain the sensing data due to a lack of incentive mechanism. Therefore, how to motivate more vehicle users to provide high-quality sensing data is the key for real-time map updates. In this article, we propose a secure and privacy-preserving incentive scheme for reliable real-time map updates, named SPIR. Specifically, under the condition of limited service platform budget and limited vehicle user's ability, an effective incentive mechanism based on reverse auction is presented, which can solve two core problems: i.e., payment control for MSP and completion quality for vehicle users. Meanwhile, a credit management and payment system based on the blockchain technique are designed. In addition, the partially blind signature technique is applied to guarantee the security of the incentive mechanism and protect the privacy of vehicle users. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that the proposed SPIR achieves near-optimal benefits, which can provide the fair reward for vehicle users and reasonable budget for the MSP. In the real-time map update services, SPIR can guarantee the computational efficiency and data reliability.

AB In this paper, we compare liability rules in a world where human-driven and fully-autonomous cars coexist. We develop a model where a manufacturer can invest to improve the safety of autonomous cars. Human drivers may decide to purchase a fully-autonomous car to save precaution costs to avoid road accidents and shift liability to the car manufacturer. As compared to the negligence rule, a strict liability regime on both human drivers and car manufacturers is proved to be a superior policy. In particular, strict liability leads to more efficient R&D investments to enhance the benefits of the technology and favors the adoption of fully-autonomous cars. We also recommend that users of fully-autonomous cars make a technology-dependent payment to a third-party if there is an accident to discipline their activity levels. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB Recently, autonomous systems have received considerable attention amongst research communities and academicians. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) find useful in several applications like transportation, surveillance, disaster management, and wildlife monitoring. One of the important issues in the UAV system is energy efficiency, which can be resolved by the use of clustering approaches. In addition, high resolution remote sensing images need to be classified for effective decision making using deep learning (DL) models. Though several models are available in the literature, only few approaches have focused on the clustering and classification processes in UAV networks. In this aspect, this paper designs a novel metaheuristic with an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system for decision making named MANFIS-DM technique on autonomous UAV systems. The proposed MANFISDM technique intends to effectively organize the UAV networks into clusters and then classify the images into appropriate class labels. The proposed MANFIS-DM technique encompasses two major stages namely quantum different evolution based clustering (QDE-C) technique and ANFIS based classification technique. Primarily, the QDE-C technique involves the design of a fitness function involving three parameters namely average distance, distance to UAVs, and UAV degree. Besides, the image classification model involves a set of subprocesses namely DenseNet based feature extraction, Adadelta based hyperparameter optimization, and ANFIS based classification. The design of QDE-C algorithm with classification model for autonomous UAV systems show the novelty of the work. The experimental result analysis of the MANFIS-DM method is carried out against benchmark dataset and the results ensured the enhanced performance of the MANFIS-DM technique over the other methods with the maximum accuy of 99.13%.

AB With the increasing demand for advanced autonomous driving, the available communication resources may become constrained over different geographic areas. In addition, due to dynamic channel variations and imperfect cell deployments, guaranteeing the required communication resources for data hungry and delay-sensitive applications in autonomous vehicles (AVs), along their entire trips, becomes challenging. To address these issues, the paper investigates the feasibility of a hybrid system-optimum and user-equilibrium AV traffic framework subject to communication constraints, as well as its performance gain. Within such a framework, the paper introduces the problems of communication-constrained routing (CCR) and traffic control (CCTC) in the context of infrastructure-assisted autonomous driving and presents respective solutions. For CCR, an efficient two-layered routing scheme is proposed which can provide optimal trip duration. Simulation results show that the routing scheme achieves a good balance between longer duration of communication coverage and acceptable source-to-destination travel time. For CCTC, it is shown that there exists an optimal AV speed on each road segment, as well as an optimal inter-AV distance and an optimal number of AVs in each cell, to maximize the road-network AV throughput within a single cell. Moreover, spectrum allocation is used to achieve Pareto-optimal road-network throughput across cells, and a new key performance index (KPI) is defined to evaluate the traffic control capability of cellular systems. Simulation results validate the improvement of AV throughput via the proposed CCTC solution.

TI Modeling Reservation-Based Autonomous Intersection Control in VISSIM
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB The use of autonomous vehicles is attracting more and more attention as a promising approach to improving both highway safety and efficiency. Most previous studies on autonomous intersection management relied heavily on custom-built simulation tools to implement and evaluate their control algorithms, but the use of nonstandard simulation platforms makes the comparison of systems almost impossible. Furthermore, without support from standard simulation platforms, reliable and trustworthy simulation results are hard to obtain. In this context, this paper explores a way to model autonomous intersections through the use of VISSIM, a standard microscopic simulation platform. A reservation-based intersection control system named autonomous control of urban traffic (ACUTA) was introduced and implemented in VISSIM through the use of VISSIM's external driver model. The operational and safety performance characteristics of ACUTA were evaluated with VISSIM's easy-to-use evaluation tools. In comparison with the results obtained with optimized signalized control, significantly reduced delays, along with a higher intersection capacity and lower volume-to-capacity ratios under various traffic demand conditions, resulted from the use of ACUTA. The safety performance of ACUTA was evaluated by use of the surrogate safety measure model, and few conflicts between vehicles within the intersection were detected. Moreover, the key steps and elements for implementation of ACUTA in VISSIM were introduced. These steps and elements can be useful for other researchers and practitioners implementing their autonomous intersection control algorithms in a standard simulation platform. By use of a standard simulation platform, the performance characteristics of autonomous intersection control algorithms can eventually be compared.

AB In this paper, an onboard vision-based system for the autonomous landing of a low-cost quadrotor is presented. A novel landing pad with different optical markers sizes is carefully designed to be robustly recognized at different distances. To provide reliable pose information in a GPS (Global Positioning System)-denied environment, a vision algorithm for real-time landing pad recognition and pose estimation is implemented. The dynamic model of the quadrotor is established and a system scheme for autonomous landing control is presented. A series of autonomous flights have been successfully performed, and a video of the experiment is available online. The efficiency and accuracy of the presented vision-based system is demonstrated by using its position and attitude estimates as control inputs for the autonomous landing of a self-customized quadrotor.

AB Autonomous operation of a vehicle on a road calls for understanding of various events involving the motions of the vehicles in its vicinity. In this paper we show how a moving vehicle which is carrying a camera can estimate the relative motions of nearby vehicles. We show how to "smooth" the motion of the observing vehicle, i.e. to correct the image sequence so that transient motions (primarily rotations) resulting from bumps, etc. are removed and the sequence corresponds more closely to the sequence that would have been collected if the motion had been smooth. We also show how to detect the motions of nearby vehicles relative to the observing vehicle. We present results for several road image sequences which demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

AB Autonomous driving is of great interest to industry and academia alike. The use of machine learning approaches for autonomous driving has long been studied, but mostly in the context of perception. In this article, we take a deeper look on the so-called end-to-end approaches for autonomous driving, where the entire driving pipeline is replaced with a single neural network. We review the learning methods, input and output modalities, network architectures, and evaluation schemes in end-to-end driving literature. Interpretability and safety are discussed separately, as they remain challenging for this approach. Beyond providing a comprehensive overview of existing methods, we conclude the review with an architecture that combines the most promising elements of the end-to-end autonomous driving systems.

AB Autonomous vehicle self-localisation by scene matching under extreme environmental changes has been among the most challenging problems in robotics and computer vision in the last few years. Large dynamic illumination changes during the day and appearance changes between different seasons are the major difficulties about this problem, especially when the comparison is made between day-time and night-time images for the same scene. This study presents a new extended local difference binary (ELDB) image descriptor that represents a robust appearance invariant extension for the state-of-the-art local difference binary (LDB) image descriptor. This study also introduces a new algorithm for vehicle visual localisation under extreme environmental changes. The new algorithm uses ELDB for image matching, and uses a modified multi-hypothesis version of the Markov localisation (MHML) filter for self-localisation. Experimental results show that the proposed modified MHML has reduced computational cost and has resulted in a faster cycle rate. Furthermore, these results show that ELDB has an improved image matching accuracy and requires less processing time compared to the original LDB. The proposed vision-based vehicle localisation algorithm is shown to be faster and more accurate than other state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB In this paper, a data-driven non-model-based approach is proposed for the adaptive optimal control of a class of connected vehicles that is composed of n human-driven vehicles only transmitting motional data and an autonomous vehicle in the tail receiving the broadcasted data from preceding vehicles by wireless vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication devices. Considering the cases of range-limited V2V communication and input saturation, several optimal control problems are formulated to minimize the errors of distance and velocity and to optimize the fuel usage. By employing an adaptive dynamic programming technique, the optimal controllers are obtained without relying on the knowledge of system dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is demonstrated via the online learning control of the connected vehicles in Paramics' traffic microsimulation.

AB This paper proposes a resident autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) system for monitoring around an underwater infrastructure using an AUV and a seafloor station (SS), where the SS serves as the positioning reference and a battery charging station for the AUV. Docking to the SS is a key technology in the system. The proposed method utilizes acoustic and visual positioning based on the SS. To increase the robustness of the method, further methods for visual positioning using limited information and autonomous judging of docking success are implemented. After completing docking, the AUV charges its batteries wirelessly. The process of balancing battery consumption and the amount of charge is formulized to enable prolonged and continuous surveying. The proposed system was evaluated in sea and tank environments using the AUV Tri-TON 2 (172) and a test-bed SS. In the sea experiments, TT2 succeeded in docking to the SS under the condition of low visibility which was within 2 m and complicated sea current induced by waves which was around 0.5 m/s. To enhance the success rate of docking, a control method considering the resistance due to sea currents is formulated. It was verified that this control method can ensure a position of TT2 maintained with 0.1 m vibration throughout the control simulation using the velocity of sea currents obtained in the sea experiments. In the tank trials, TT2 succeeded in operating continuously during three days while performing autonomous docking to the SS and charging its batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Several applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence, have acquired importance and come to the fore as a result of recent advances and improvements in these approaches. Autonomous cars are one such application. This is expected to have a significant and revolutionary influence on society. Integration with smart cities, new infrastructure and urban planning with sophisticated cyber-security are some of the current ramifications of self-driving automobiles. The autonomous automobile, often known as self driving systems or driverless vehicles, is a vehicle that can perceive its surroundings and navigate predetermined routes without human involvement. Cars are on the verge of evolving into autonomous robots, thanks to significant breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and related technologies, and this will have a wide range of socio-economic implications. However, in order for these automobiles to become a reality, they must be endowed with the perception and cognition necessary to deal with high-pressure real-life events and make proper judgments and take appropriate action. The majority of self-driving car technologies are based on computer systems that automate vehicle control parts. From forward-collision warning and antilock brakes to lane-keeping and adaptive drive control, to fully automated driving, these technological components have a wide range of capabilities. A self-driving car combines a wide range of sensors, actuators, and cameras. Recent researches on computer vision and deep learning are used to control autonomous driving systems. For self-driving automobiles, lane-keeping is crucial. This study presents a deep learning approach to obtain the proper steering angle to maintain the robot in the lane. We propose an advanced control for a self driving robot by using two controllers simultaneously. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are employed, to predict the car' and a proportional integral-derivative (PID) controller is designed for speed and steering control.

AB This paper proposes a lateral control system for an unmanned vehicle that is designed to improve the responsiveness of the system with the use of a PD control. The vehicle heading error can be stabilized, and the transient response characteristics can be improved using the proposed controller. A mathematical model of the vehicle dynamics using two degrees of freedom was developed for the controller design. The waypoint tracking method for autonomous navigation was tested with incorporation of the Point-to-Point algorithm with position and heading measurements received from GPS receivers via Kalman filtering. The performance of the designed controller was verified through experiments with a real vehicle.

A crossed tracked vehicle is proposed to overcome the problem of possible overturning The vehicle is equipped with a frontal TV camera and communicates with its off-board control, placed outside the vessel, by means of an umbilical cord which includes signal and power cables and can be used to recover the vehicle in case of failure. Since the inspection will be performed without venting the vessel, all components must be compatible with UHV condition. An insertion system made up of two telescopic elements and a rotating chute was also designed to introduce the vehicle into the vessel in safe conditions.

AB Simulation and experimental study on lateral control for autonomous driving is presented in this paper. The objective of the lateral control system is to make the controlled vehicle follow the preceding vehicle. Simulation study is conducted for investigating the relationship between information for lateral control and the tracking accuracy obtained based on the information. Simulation results of vehicle-following control based on five kinds of control algorithms, each of which is designed using some information for lateral control, are compared and discussed. Experimental study is carried out by use of two vehicles to validate results of the simulation study. By both studies, it is clarified that side slip angle is the essential information for implementing an accurate vehicle-following control.

AB This paper presents our autonomous driving (AD) software stack, developed to complete the main mission of the contest we entered. The main mission can be simply described as a robo-taxi service on public roads, to transport passengers to their destination autonomously. Among the key competencies required for the main mission, this paper focused on high-definition mapping, vehicle control, and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. V2I communication refers to the task of wireless data exchange between a roadside unit and vehicles. With the data being captured and shared, rich, timely, and non-line-of-sight-aware traffic information can be utilized for a wide range of AD applications. In the contest, V2I communication was applied for a robo-taxi service, and also for traffic light recognition. A V2I communication-enabled traffic light recognizer was developed, to achieve a nearly perfect recognition rate, and a robo-taxi service handler was developed, to perform the main mission of the contest.

ID ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; SHIP; DESIGN
AB Surface-vehicle berthing is a complex and challenging task. It involves complicated ship dynamics owing to a large drift angle and the time-varying environmental disturbances induced by wind, wave, and current. Therefore, berthing requires state processing at each step and a controller that can respond to the non-linear behavior of the unmanned surface vehicle (USV). Herein, a systematic approach for the autonomous berthing of a USV is proposed. A state-machine approach is proposed to solve state transitions in the berthing step. A model reference adaptive controller was adopted to cope with the uncertainty of USV dynamics during berthing. Herein, the theoretical background and design of the adaptive controller are described. Simulation for the validation of the proposed method was conducted using the robot operating system Gazebo-based simulator. Finally, the respective performances of the proposed method and conventional controller were compared. Using the proposed berthing approach, an accurate and stable docking of small USVs became achievable.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE
AB Much of the benefits of deploying unmanned aerial vehicles can be derived from autonomous missions. For such missions, however, sense-and-avoid capability (i.e., the ability to detect potential collisions and avoid them) is a critical requirement. Collision avoidance can be broadly classified into global and local path-planning algorithms, both of which need to be addressed in a successful mission. Whereas global path planning (which is mainly done offline) broadly lays out a path that reaches the goal point, local collision-avoidance algorithms, which are usually fast, reactive, and carried out online, ensure safety of the vehicle from unexpected and unforeseen obstacles/collisions. Even though many techniques for both global and local collision avoidance have been proposed in the recent literature, there is a great interest around the globe to solve this important problem comprehensively and efficiently and such techniques are still evolving. This paper presents a brief overview of a few promising and evolving ideas on collision avoidance for unmanned aerial vehicles, with a preferential bias toward local collision avoidance.

AB This paper describes the guidance law design of a group of autonomous cooperative vehicles using model predictive control. The developed control strategy allows one to find a feasible near optimal control sequence with a short and constant computation delay in all situations. The control strategy takes other vehicles predicted positions into account for cooperation purpose. Numerical simulations are provided where a group of quadrotors must reach several way-points while avoiding obstacles and collisions inside the group. Results obtained using a realistic model of small quadrotors show that the approach could be usable in practice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Therefore, modern vehicle research is focused on improving driving comfort as well as passengers' safety. Aiming at that, recent advances in control engineering and modern computer technology enable the engineer to design special control and supervision systems to support the driver. As an example, this contribution presents two possible solutions.

   Vehicle dynamics; Robots; Autonomous driving; reinforcement learning;

AB Autonomous driving in multi-agent dynamic traffic scenarios is challenging: the behaviors of road users are uncertain and are hard to model explicitly, and the ego-vehicle should apply complicated negotiation skills with them, such as yielding, merging and taking turns, to achieve both safe and efficient driving in various settings. Traditional planning methods are largely rule-based and scale poorly in these complex dynamic scenarios, often leading to reactive or even overly conservative behaviors. Therefore, they require tedious human efforts to maintain workability. Recently, deep learning-based methods have shown promising results with better generalization capability but less hand engineering efforts. However, they are either implemented with supervised imitation learning (IL), which suffers from dataset bias and distribution mismatch issues, or are trained with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) but focus on one specific traffic scenario. In this work, we propose DQ-GAT to achieve scalable and proactive autonomous driving, where graph attention-based networks are used to implicitly model interactions, and deep Q-learning is employed to train the network end-to-end in an unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments in a high-fidelity driving simulator show that our method achieves higher success rates than previous learning-based methods and a traditional rule-based method, and better trades off safety and efficiency in both seen and unseen scenarios. Moreover, qualitative results on a trajectory dataset indicate that our learned policy can be transferred to the real world for practical applications with real-time speeds. Demonstration videos are available at https://caipeide.github.io/dq-gat/.

TI Multi-Agent Simulation of a Demand-Responsive Transit System Operated by
   Autonomous Vehicles
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Shared mobility solutions improve traffic efficiency in cities. This paper addresses the design of an urban demand-responsive transit system operated by a fleet of autonomous modules as a public transportation service. We introduce a discrete event-based multi-agent simulation to reflect system dynamics at an operational level. Vehicles, customers, and intelligent stops are modeled as software agents. Each entity has its own decision-making and planning component. Vehicles compete for a limited number of order requests, and decentralized stops manage the matching between a customer and a prospective vehicle. Scheduling and routing events take place highly dynamically. A simulation study evaluates a demand-responsive operation as a replacement for a fixed-route bus service. Results show that a total demand of 2.3 million rides can be fulfilled with a fleet of around 43,000 six-seater modules. In comparison with the current bus system, the total energy consumption and the system's utilization are improved, while transport times and distances result in values below the bus system's performance and therefore must be optimized in further research.

AB Autonomous Mobility-On-Demand (AMoD) provides new options for the morning commute problem. The flexibility of AMoD could help to boost the attractiveness and accessibility of Public Transportation (PT). Intermodal AMoD systems could become a competitive alternative to personal cars. However, considering the convenience, comfort, and expected low fares of autonomous vehicles, there is a risk of competition between privately operated AMoD and PT. The joint design of PT and AMoD can foster their cooperation. This study investigates the joint PT-AMoD design problem in a many-to-one multimodal corridor where three transportation alternatives are available: full personal car on a congested freeway, walking and massive rapid transit (MRT), or autonomous vehicle (AV) and MRT. We introduce a simple dynamic model incorporating a time-dependent mode and route choice subject to user equilibrium (UE) constraints. The model presented: (i) accounts for how UE settles and evolves, (ii) provides insight on PT-AMoD cooperation opportunities and competition risks depending on the design choices, (iii) is compatible with design optimization heuristics. We apply the model to a realistic scenario based in the city of Lyon (France). The number of MRT stations, their locations, the number of AV fleets, and their coverage zone boundaries are optimized with a metaheuristic. The optimization is conducted according to three policies regarding AMoD (protectionism, opportunism, liberalism) and three priority objectives (maximize MRT usage, minimize travel times, reduce car usage). We formulate recommendations for the transportation authority by evaluating the potential benefits of each policy.

AB Path tracking error control is an essential functionality in the development of autonomous vehicles to follow a planned trajectory. Significant path tracking errors could lead to a collision or even out of the control of the vehicle. Model-based control strategies have been developed to minimize the vehicle's path tracking errors. However, the vehicle model may not truly represent the actual vehicle dynamics. Furthermore, the parameters employed in the vehicle dynamic model may not represent the actual operating conditions of the vehicle under environmental uncertainty. This paper proposes a real-time bias-learning method coupling with the model predictive control (MPC) to improve the fidelity of a baseline vehicle model with the aid of a few experiments (or virtual experiments) so that the path tracking error can be reduced in real-time operation. Gaussian process (GP) regression and recurrent neural network (RNN) are employed for bias-learning and their effectiveness are compared under different scenarios. GP regression learns non-linearity of the model bias through its nonlinear kernel function, whereas the RNN model formulates the bias as a linear combination of hidden nodes which capture the non-linearity of the model bias with a recurrent form. Results reveal that RNN is more effective for real-time learning of the nonlinear model bias than the classical GP regression and the proposed bias-learning model is able to improve the fidelity of a baseline vehicle dynamic model. Consequently, path tracking performance can be greatly improved under environmental uncertainty using the bias-learning-based MPC.

AB As driverless vehicles are increasingly becoming possible, so does the use of such vehicles as intelligent carriers in different domains. Intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) show increasingly heterogeneous, cyber-physical, cooperative, and service-oriented features and are beginning to be merged with the emerging cyber-physical-social systems. Given this new trend, how to make these intelligent vehicles cooperate more safely and efficiently with one another according to novel constraints, such as mission type and quality-of-service (QoS), has become a vital aspect of cooperative ITS (C-ITS). With these emerging characteristics, the classical passing-through-intersection problem has gained new connotations, worth further exploring. After analyzing the essences of this new problem, service-oriented cooperation models and mechanisms for whole autonomous vehicles approaching intersections are investigated in this paper. First, related traffic objects and possible vehicular behaviors are abstracted and modeled with the cyber-physical cooperative features and QoS constraints. A new reservation-based scheduling procedure is then conducted by employing the concepts of vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, and typical vehicular passing-through behaviors and several spatial-temporal constraints are designed to coordinate vehicles passing through an intersection divided as a series of continuous static critical sections. Given these considerations, a priority-based centralized scheduling algorithm, named csPriorFIFO, which adopts a novel priority inheritance mechanism to promote the traffic QoS of emergent vehicles, is proposed. Finally, all these designs are implemented in a traffic simulator named QoS-CITS, and the functions and the performance of these studied methods are verified and compared.

AB With the development of Internet of Vehicles, the platooning strategy has been widely studied as the potential approach to ensure the safety of autonomous driving. Vehicles in the form of platoon adopt 802.11p to exchange messages through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. When multiple platoons arrive at an intersection, the leader vehicle of each platoon adjusts its movement characteristics to ensure that it can cross the intersection, and thus the following vehicles have to adjust their movement characteristics accordingly. In this case, the time-varying connectivity among vehicles leads to the significant nonstationary performance change in platooning communications, which may incur safety issues. In this article, we construct the time-dependent model to evaluate the platooning communication performance at the intersection based on the initial movement characteristics. We first consider the movement behaviors of vehicles at the intersection, including turning, accelerating, decelerating, and stopping as well as the periodic change of traffic lights to construct a movement model and then establish a hearing network to reflect the time-varying connectivity among vehicles. Afterward, we adopt the pointwise stationary fluid flow approximation (PSFFA) to model the nonstationary behavior of the transmission queue. Then, we consider four access categories (ACs) and continuous backoff freezing of 802.11p to construct the models to describe the time-dependent access process of 802.11p. Finally, based on the time-dependent model, the packet transmission delay (PTD) and packet delivery ratio (PDR) are derived. The accuracy of our proposed model is verified by comparing the simulation results with analytical results.

AB Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communication allows vehicles to wirelessly exchange information on the surrounding environment and enables cooperative perception. It helps prevent accidents, increase the safety of the passengers, and improve the traffic flow efficiency. However, these benefits can only come when the vehicles can communicate with each other in a fast and reliable manner. Therefore, we investigated two areas to improve the communication quality of V2V: First, using beamforming to increase the bandwidth of V2V communication by establishing accurate and stable collaborative beam connection between vehicles on the road; second, ensuring scalable transmission to decrease the amount of data to be transmitted, thus reduce the bandwidth requirements needed for collaborative perception of autonomous driving vehicles. Beamforming in V2V communication can be achieved by utilizing image-based and LIDAR's 3D data-based vehicle detection and tracking. For vehicle detection and tracking simulation, we tested the Single Shot Multibox Detector deep learning-based object detection method that can achieve a mean Average Precision of 0.837 and the Kalman filter for tracking. For scalable transmission, we simulate the effect of varying pixel resolutions as well as different image compression techniques on the file size of data. Results show that without compression, the file size for only transmitting the bounding boxes containing detected object is up to 10 times less than the original file size. Similar results are also observed when the file is compressed by lossless and lossy compression to varying degrees. Based on these findings using existing databases, the impact of these compression methods and methods of effectively combining feature maps on the performance of object detection and tracking models will be further tested in the real-world autonomous driving system.

AB To make intelligent decisions in an autonomous vehicle, the system must predict the future reactions of surrounding vehicles for any given action plan of the ego vehicle. However, learning reactive trajectories is challenging due to scant action-reaction pair data. That is, building a dataset with multiple action-reaction pairs for an identical scene history is impossible in reality. Here, we propose a semi-supervised learning framework with auxiliary structures to handle this problem. The proposed training framework has two modules: Action Reconstructor and Identifier modules with corresponding loss functions referred to as the Reconstruction Loss and Association Loss. In addition to the conventional supervised approach pertaining to readily available data, the Action Reconstructor module is employed to learn the dependencies on the ego vehicle in an unsupervised manner. Furthermore, reaction trajectory data corresponding to the augmented future trajectories of the ego vehicle are not available, meaning that the model must be trained in an unsupervised manner as well. The main idea of the proposed unsupervised learning method is to find the identity feature vector from both history and future trajectories and associate these features for each vehicle. This idea is realized by introducing the Identifier network and the Association Loss, which are used only during the training process. Interestingly, experimental results show that plausible reaction can be predicted for the augmented future trajectory of the ego vehicle, which indicates that the network can generalize the interactive behavior of vehicles from a partially labelled dataset.

DT Article
DE Lane-keeping; collision avoidance; automotive; autonomous vehicle;
   modeling; obstacle
AB This paper examines a symbolic numerical approach to optimize a vehicles track for autonomous driving and collision avoidance. The new approach uses the classical cost function definition incorporating the essential aspects of the dynamic state of the vehicle as position, orientation, time sampling, and constraints on slip angles of tires. The optimization processes minimize the cost function and simultaneously determine the optimal track by varying steering and breaking amplitudes. The current velocity of the vehicle is limited to a maximal velocity, thus, allowing a stable search of the optimal track. The parametric definition of obstacles generates a flexible environment for low and high speed simulations. The minimal number of influential optimization variables guarantees a stable and direct generation of optimal results. By the current new approach to control a vehicle on an optimal track, we are able to autonomously move the vehicle on an arbitrary track approximated by low order polynomials. The optimization approach is also able to deal with a variety of different obstacles and the corresponding optimal smooth obstacle path. The computations demonstrate the effective control of a four wheel vehicle in normal operation and exceptional obstacle avoidance with continuously differentiable obstacle avoidance tracks. Simulation tests are done using vehicles velocities of 3, 6, 7.6, 10, 12, and 18 m/s. At higher vehicles velocities, a mathematical-only approach is not sufficient and a mechanical intervention for tires is needed as a complimentary part to control the slip angle. The results shows that the cost function reached a considerably high average convergence-to-zero rate success in most of the tested scenarios.

ID LOCALIZATION
AB UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) have been developed and adopted for various fields including military, IT, agriculture, construction, and so on. In particular, UAVs are being heavily used in the field of disaster relief thanks to the fact that UAVs are becoming smaller and more intelligent. Search for a person in a disaster site can be difficult if the mobile communication network is not available, and if the person is in the GPS shadow area. Recently, the search for survivors using unmanned aerial vehicles has been studied, but there are several problems as the search is mainly using images taken with cameras (including thermal imaging cameras). For example, it is difficult to distinguish a distressed person from a long distance especially in the presence of cover. Considering these challenges, we proposed an autonomous UAV smart search system that can complete their missions without interference in search and tracking of castaways even in disaster areas where communication with base stations is likely to be lost. To achieve this goal, we first make UAVs perform autonomous flight with locating and approaching the distressed people without the help of the ground control server (GCS). Second, to locate a survivor accurately, we developed a genetic-based localization algorithm by detecting changes in the signal strength between distress and drones inside the search system. Specifically, we modeled our target platform with a genetic algorithm and we re-defined the genetic algorithm customized to the disaster site's environment for tracking accuracy. Finally, we verified the proposed search system in several real-world sites and found that it successfully located targets with autonomous flight.

TI Extracting Rules from Autonomous-Vehicle-Involved Crashes by Applying
   Decision Tree and Association Rule Methods
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

ID NEURAL-NETWORK MODELS; INJURY SEVERITY; FREQUENCY
AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) can dramatically reduce the number of traffic crashes and associated fatalities by eliminating the avoidable human-error-related crash contributing factors. Many companies have been conducting pilot tests on public roads in several states in the U.S. and other countries to accelerate AV mass deployment. AV pilot operations on Californian public roads saw 251 AV-involved crashes (as of February 2020). These AV-involved crashes provide a unique opportunity to investigate AV crash risks in the mixed traffic environment. This study collected the AV crash reports from the California Department of Motor Vehicles and applied the decision tree and association rule methods to extract the pre-crash rules of AV-involved crashes. Extracted rules revealed that the most frequent types of AV crashes were rear-end crashes and predominantly occurred at intersections when AVs were stopped and engaged in the autonomous mode. AV and non-AV manufacturers and transportation agencies can use the findings of this study to minimize AV-related crashes. AV companies could install a distinct signal/display to inform the operational mode of the AVs (i.e., autonomous or non-autonomous) to human drivers around them. Moreover, the automatic emergency braking system in non-AVs could avoid a significant number of rear-end crashes as, often, rear-end crashes occurred as a result of the failure of following non-AVs to slow down in time behind AVs. Transportation agencies can consider separating AVs from non-AVs by assigning "AV Only" lanes to eliminate the excessive rear-end crashes resulting from the mistakes of human drivers in non-AVs at intersections.

AB Autonomous driving requires robust and highly accurate perception technologies. Various deep learning algorithms based on only image processing satisfy this requirement, but few such algorithms are based on LiDAR. However, images are only one part of the perceptible sensors in an autonomous driving vehicle; LiDAR is also essential for the recognition of driving environments. The main reason why there exist few deep learning algorithms based on LiDAR is a lack of data. Recent translation technology using generative adversarial networks (GANs) has been proposed to deal with this problem. However, these technologies focus on only image-to-image translation, although a lack of data occurs more often with LiDAR than with images. LiDAR translation technology is required not only for data augmentation, but also for driving simulation, which allows algorithms to practice driving as if they were commanding a real vehicle, before doing so in the real world. In other words, driving simulation is a key technology for evaluating and verifying algorithms which are practically applied to vehicles. In this paper, we propose a GAN-based LiDAR translation algorithm for autonomous driving and driving simulation. It is the first LiDAR translation approach that can deal with various types of weather that are based on an empirical approach. We tested the proposed method on the JARI data set, which was collected under various adverse weather scenarios with diverse precipitation and visible distance settings. The proposed method was also applied to the real-world Spain data set. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate realistic LiDAR data under adverse weather conditions.

AB New innovations in warehouse automation systems such as autonomous vehicle-based storage and retrieval (AVS/R) system offer greater flexibility and responsiveness in processing unit-load storage and retrieval transactions in high-density storage areas. To optimise system performance, new technologies should be implemented with optimal setting of design parameters. This research is a first attempt to model a zone-captive' AVS/R system and understand the effect of number and boundary of vertical zones on system performance measures. Further, we also analyse the effect of aisle orientation within a tier on cycle times. A detailed simulation model of a multi-tier zone-captive system is built to capture the dynamics of the system i.e. interaction among the vehicles, lift and incoming transaction requests, and estimate the performance measures of interest. The numerical experiments show that the transaction cycle times can be reduced by 1-12% with optimal partitioning of vertical zones and further reduced by 0.2-15.0% by a better aisle orientation.

AB With recent advances in battery capacity and the development of hydrogen fuel cells, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are being used to undertake longer missions that were previously performed by manned or tethered vehicles. As a result, more advanced navigation systems are needed to maintain an accurate position over a larger operational area. The accuracy of the navigation system is critical to the quality of the data collected during survey missions and the recovery of the AUV. Many different methods for navigation in different underwater environments have been proposed in the literature. In this correspondence paper, the state of the art in navigation technologies for AUVs is investigated for theoretical and operational systems. Their suitability for use in different environments is compared and current limitations of these methods are identified. In addition, new approaches to address these current problems and areas for future research are suggested. Finally, it is concluded that only geophysically referenced methods will enable AUVs to navigate accurately over large areas and that advances in underwater feature recognition are required before these methods can be implemented in operational AUVs.

AB High accuracy vehicle localization information is critical for intelligent transportation systems and future autonomous vehicles. It is challenging to achieve the required centimeter-level localization accuracy, especially in urban or global navigation satellite system denied environments. Here we propose a vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)-based vehicle localization algorithm. First, it is low-cost and hardware requirements are simplified, the minimum requirement is a single roadside unit and single on-board receiver. Second, it is computationally efficient, the available V2I information is formulated as an over-determined system. Then, the vehicle position is estimated in a closed-form manner via the widely used weighted linear least squares (WLLS) method and meter level accuracy is achievable. Furthermore, the numerical performance of WLLS is consistent with the theoretical results in larger signal-to-noise ratio region.

AB Advances in consumer electronics products and the technology seen in personal computers, digital cameras, and smartphones phones have led to the price/performance ratio of sensors and processors falling dramatically over the last decade. In particular, many consumer products are packaged with small cameras, gyroscopes, and accelerometers, all sensors that are needed for autonomous robots in GPS-denied environments. The low mass and small form factor make them particularly well suited for autonomous flight with small flying robots. In this work, we present the first fully autonomous smartphone-based system for quadrotors. We show how multiple quadrotors can be stabilized and controlled to achieve autonomous flight in indoor buildings with application to smart homes, search and rescue, monitoring construction projects, and developing models for architecture design. In our work, the computation for sensing and control runs on an off-the-shelf smartphone, with all the software functionality embedded in a smartphone app. No additional sensors or processors are required for autonomous flight. We are also able to use multiple, coordinated autonomous aerial vehicles to improve the efficiency of our mission. In our framework, multiple vehicles are able to plan safe trajectories avoiding inter-robot collisions, while concurrently building in a cooperative manner a three-dimensional map of the environment. The work allows any consumer with any number of robots equipped with smartphones to autonomously drive a team of quadrotor robots, even without GPS, by downloading our app and cooperatively build three-dimensional maps.

AB In this article, an active collision avoidance based on improved artificial potential field is proposed to satisfy collision avoidance for intelligent vehicle. A longitudinal safety distance model based on analysis of braking process and a lane-changing safety spacing model based on minimum time of lane changing under the constraint of sideslip angle are presented. In addition, an improved artificial potential field method is introduced, which represents the influence of environmental information with artificial force. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm over collision avoidance for intelligent vehicle.

AB Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) has gained increasing interest due to its potential to provide low latency and reduce the load in backhaul networks. In order to meet drastically increasing computation demands from emerging ever-growing vehicular applications, e.g., autonomous driving, abundant computation resources of individual vehicles can play a crucial role in task execution in a VEC scenario, that can further contribute in considerably improving user experience. This is however an extremely challenging task due to high mobility of vehicles that can easily lead to intermittent connectivity, thereby disrupting on-going task processing. In this paper, we propose a task offloading scheme by exploiting multi-hop vehicle computation resources in VEC based on mobility analysis of vehicles. In addition to the vehicles within one hop from the task vehicle that generates computation tasks, certain multi-hop vehicles that meet the given requirements in terms of link connectivity and computation capacity, are also leveraged to carry out the tasks offloaded by the task vehicle. An optimization problem is formulated for the task vehicle to minimize the weighted sum of execution time and computation cost of all tasks. A semidefinite relaxation approach with an adaptive adjustment procedure is proposed to solve the formulated optimization problem for obtaining the corresponding offloading decisions. The simulation results show that our proposed offloading scheme can achieve significant improvement in terms of response delay by at least 34% compared with the other algorithms (e.g., local processing and random offloading).

AB Vehicle detection, the process of identifying vehicles as axis-aligned bounding boxes in still images, is widely used to estimate the range, time-to-collision, and motion of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Bounding boxes, while convenient, are too coarse to adapt well to vehicle shape and pose variations. In this work, we present TBox (Trapezoid & Box), a novel fine-grained representation useful for both localization and recognition that extends the bounding box by restricting the spatial extent of a vehicle to a set of keypoints and indicating semantically significant local areas using subclasses. In contrast to the previous monolithic models, we propose a cascaded anchor-free architecture to estimate the bounding box and TBox. One subnetwork uses a stacked hourglass network to detect each vehicle as a pair of corners without using anchors. Specifically, it learns corner affinity fields, enabling it to perform robust corner grouping. The other subnetwork estimates a TBox as a set of keypoints. This subnetwork utilizes the bounding box results to avoid ambiguous keypoint associations and reuses existing features to reduce the number of parameters. We also propose a multitask learning strategy for training the cascaded model that implicitly integrates the global context with local details, introducing improvements for both tasks. During testing, a refinement algorithm explicitly uses robust local keypoints to correct possible global box errors, ensuring tight geometric representations for nearby critical vehicles. The experiments show that our method outperforms existing anchor-free detectors for vehicle detection and achieves better performance on the TBox task while using a small model.

TI Robust mission planning for Autonomous Marine Vehicle fleets

DT Article
DE Planning Al; Multi-robot systems; Marine robotics
ID ORIENTEERING PROBLEM; ARCHITECTURE; ALGORITHM
AB Mission planning for Autonomous Marine Vehicles (AMVs) is non-trivial because significant uncertainty is present when profiling the operating environment, especially for underwater missions. Mission complexity is compounded for each vehicle added to the mission. In practice, fleet operations are formulated as separate temporal problems by the operator and solved using a temporal planner. This paper proposes a planning method that uses energy as the base planning resource instead of time. Unlike temporal planners, energy planners account for physical loads endured by the vehicles. The extent of uncertainty in the vehicle loads is clarified by using the vehicle dynamics model and Monte Carlo simulation on the model parameters. The planning method is a multistage procedure to decompose operator specified task, obstacle, and vehicle data into an energy formulation of the Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) which is then solved using Discrete Strengthened PSO (DStPSO). The DStPSO algorithm has been modified to include a selective swarm size decay method that allows for larger initial swarm sizes to promote early exploration and preserves a percentage of the best performing particles on each iteration to save computational resources. The planner produces near-optimal routes containing feasible trajectories for individual vehicles that maximise tasks completed according to individual vehicle energy constraints. A case-study mission for long-term, large-scale, underwater inspection of a wind turbine array was converted into input data to evaluate the planner. Energy planning presents the opportunity for vehicles to actively monitor the feasibility of their individual plan against their current energy consumption, allowing for advanced reasoning and fault handling to occur in situ without operator assistance.

AB Packet loss in block erasure channels creates a randomly switching networked system that impacts control performance significantly. This paper employs safety of highway vehicle platoons as a platform to study such an impact. By autonomous intervehicle coordination, a platoon can potentially enhance safety, improve highway utility, increase fuel economy, and reduce emission. By comparing different information structures that utilize radar distance sensors and wireless communication channels, we characterize some intrinsic relationships between communication resources and control performance. The findings of this paper provide useful guidelines in communication resource allocations and vehicle coordination in vehicle safety problems.

ID CALIBRATION; CAMERA; ROAD; VISION; FUSION; RADAR
AB Autonomous driving vehicles rely on sensors for the robust perception of their surroundings. Such vehicles are equipped with multiple perceptive sensors with a high level of redundancy to ensure safety and reliability in any driving condition. However, multi-sensor, such as camera, LiDAR, and radar systems raise requirements related to sensor calibration and synchronization, which are the fundamental blocks of any autonomous system. On the other hand, sensor fusion and integration have become important aspects of autonomous driving research and directly determine the efficiency and accuracy of advanced functions such as object detection and path planning. Classical model-based estimation and data-driven models are two mainstream approaches to achieving such integration. Most recent research is shifting to the latter, showing high robustness in real-world applications but requiring large quantities of data to be collected, synchronized, and properly categorized. However, there are two major research gaps in existing works: (i) they lack fusion (and synchronization) of multi-sensors, camera, LiDAR and radar; and (ii) generic scalable, and user-friendly end-to-end implementation. To generalize the implementation of the multi-sensor perceptive system, we introduce an end-to-end generic sensor dataset collection framework that includes both hardware deploying solutions and sensor fusion algorithms. The framework prototype integrates a diverse set of sensors, such as camera, LiDAR, and radar. Furthermore, we present a universal toolbox to calibrate and synchronize three types of sensors based on their characteristics. The framework also includes the fusion algorithms, which utilize the merits of three sensors, namely, camera, LiDAR, and radar, and fuse their sensory information in a manner that is helpful for object detection and tracking research. The generality of this framework makes it applicable in any robotic or autonomous applications and suitable for quick and large-scale practical deployment.

AB For accurate control and navigation of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) it is critical to know the water current velocities around the vehicle body. The AUV-onboard acoustic doppler current profilers are unable to measure the current near to the vehicle due to their blanking distance, so an AUV model-based observer can serve the purpose of estimating the current velocities surrounding the vehicle. In this paper, a high-gain observer based on an AUV dynamics model was used to estimate 3D water current velocities. The water current velocities were determined by calculating the differences between the vehicle velocities over the ground measured by a Doppler velocity log-aided inertial navigation system and the vehicle velocities through the water estimated by the model-based observer. Modeling and field trials of a Gavia AUV were used to demonstrate the approach. Instead of deriving the roll, pitch, and yaw motions, these were directly given as simulation inputs which allowed the AUV dynamics model to be simplified to 3-degrees of freedom. This paper presents a real-time model identification algorithm to identify the nonlinear parameters of the AUV model by utilizing a recursive least squares method. The real-time model identification algorithm allows the AUV model to be continuously updated in response to the operational environment. A high-gain observer was chosen as a nonlinear estimation algorithm to obtain the vehicle velocities through the water, and the Lyapunov stability of the estimation error dynamics was investigated. The observer gain was computed by solving the linear matrix inequality which represented the error dynamics. By utilizing the observer in the AUV dynamic model, the vehicle's velocity vector through the water was estimated, then the current velocity vector was calculated. In order to investigate the differences between the estimated current velocities and the measured current velocities, the standard deviations between these two were quantified. The results showed that the current estimation found by using the model-based observer was improved compared with the previous water current estimation method, which found the water velocity components in a turbulent water column from the AUV motion response.

AB Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are set to be the next global revolution in transportation. One of the major challenges in a CAV environment is handling the positional-forgery of Basic Safety Messages while calculating critical traffic gaps at a Stop Sign Gap Assist controlled intersection. Traditionally, positional-forgery has been handled by isolated instances of physical layer detection and correction mechanisms, which proved unreliable during the multi-hop and majority malicious vehicle scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Positional-forgEry Resistant traFfic gap Estimation for Connected inTersection management (PERFECT) that performs optimal traffic gap estimation even during multi-hop scenarios and majority malicious positional-forgery attacks. The framework reduces traffic gap estimation error during majority malicious scenarios by over 60%, keeps the average error within 8.17%-10.62% and minimizes the maximum error across a range of malicious situations.

ID PATH-FOLLOWING CONTROL; TRAJECTORY-TRACKING; DESIGN
AB Visual tracking is an essential building block for target tracking and capture of the underwater vehicles. On the basis of remotely autonomous control architecture, this paper has proposed an improved kernelized correlation filter (KCF) tracker and a novel fuzzy controller. The model is trained to learn an online correlation filter from a plenty of positive and negative training samples. In order to overcome the influence from occlusion, the improved KCF tracker has been designed with an added self-discrimination mechanism based on system confidence uncertainty. The novel fuzzy logic tracking controller can automatically generate and optimize fuzzy rules. Through Q-learning algorithm, the fuzzy rules are acquired through the estimating value of each state action pairs. An S surface based fitness function has been designed for the improvement of learning based particle swarm optimization. Tank and channel experiments have been carried out to verify the proposed tracker and controller through pipe tracking and target grasp on the basis of designed open frame underwater vehicle.

AB The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has recently published a new set of specifications to enable advanced driving applications in fifth generation (5G) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) scenarios, with particular effort dedicated to the sidelink resource allocation in the autonomous mode, named Mode 2. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of Mode 2 performance via an open-source system-level simulator, which implements the 5G New Radio (NR) flexible numerology and physical layer aspects together with the newly specified sidelink resource allocation modes for V2X communications and different data traffic patterns. Results collected through extensive simulation campaigns, under a wide variety of vehicle density, data transmission settings and traffic patterns, showcase the effects of the new 5G-V2X features on the sidelink resource allocation performance and provide some insights into possible ways to further improve Mode 2 performance.

AB This investigation takes the first step toward characterizing autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) behavior trying to perform station keeping using bioinspired thrusters under the influence of disturbances with multiple amplitudes and frequencies. We describe the similarities between periodic disturbance rejection and the frequency response of the AUV performing oscillating maneuvers, and the significance of maneuvering regimes previously identified for this type of propulsion. We measured the exact position/orientation of the AUV using an underwater motion capture system and provide position data to the AUV controller in real time for feedback control. A wave disturbance generator was developed for this study in order to characterize the vehicle tracking performance in the presence of both high-amplitude low-frequency disturbances and low-amplitude high-frequency disturbances. The bioinspired maneuvering technique is demonstrated to provide adequate control capabilities for both types of disturbances maintaining in all cases position errors less than half the vehicle diameter, and proved especially adept at compensating for low-amplitude high-frequency disturbances, which can be difficult to overcome using traditional marine thrusters.

AB Varying numbers and types of vehicles, various road structures and traffic rules bring difficulties to an autonomous vehicle driving in highway traffic scenarios. It is important to simultaneously consider all these elements in an integrated framework when predicting the future trajectories of surrounding vehicles. This paper presents a unified graphical representation method for dynamic traffic scenarios based on integrating not only the constraints from vehicles but also the collision risk implied behind road structures and traffic rules. Different from previous studies which ignores road structures and traffic rules or separately represent them in a qualitative way, this method can make better use of the influences of these environment elements in a quantitative way to improve trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles in highway scenarios. Specifically, this method first assesses the permissibility and passability of different types of roads and vehicles, and then defines their collision risk level based on traffic rules like speed limit or priority signs. Secondly, the bird-view scenarios are rasterized and rendered as color-scaled feature maps based on this risk level. Finally, multiple feature maps with various spatial and temporal perspective field are sequentially fed to a convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) network to predict trajectories for surrounding vehicles. We implement the model on NGSIM dataset and achieve satisfying prediction accuracy, for example, the error over 5s time prediction horizon can be reduced to less than 2.78 m in longitudinal and 0.26 m in lateral direction.

   scan sonar; Adaptive line -of -sight
AB Submarine cables and pipelines laid on the seafloor are critical infrastructures for energy transportation and communication transmission and must be inspected in a timely manner to determine maintenance needs. Autonomous inspection of cables (including pipelines) and their surroundings using underwater vehicles is difficult because of sensor myopia and deviations in cable routing. This study proposes an automatic cabletracking method (ACTM) based on side-scan sonar (SSS) that endows autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with autonomous decision-making capabilities to achieve fast localization and stable tracking of submarine cables with large uncertainties. Compared with the traditional predefined waypoint method, the proposed method decomposes the tasks into a series of independent behaviors according to operational objectives; thus, the AUV can perform online dynamic task replanning and realize an autonomous coverage search of the target region. When a cable is detected, the cable-tracking task is constructed as a path-following control problem on the horizontal plane. To reduce uncertainties caused by environmental noise and sensor measurement errors, a uniform motion model based on target tracking theory was used to model the virtual mass abstracted from the cable, and the states of the cable were estimated using the Kalman filter. Subsequently, an adaptive line-of-sight guidance algorithm for the SSS is established to dynamically adjust the look-ahead distance by introducing states such as cable curvature and angular change rate, which somewhat alleviates the tracking loss caused by the SSS short-sightedness. The proposed ACTM effectiveness and robustness were validated through numerical simulations and field tests. The results showed that the proposed method can achieve automatic search and adaptive tracking of cables, further reducing the role of humans in the task.

ID DESIGN
AB Increasing demand for versatile and long-endurance autonomous underwater vehicles puts significant design pressure on all aspects of AUV design and operation, including that of the propulsive system. The present study discusses testing of a thruster unit and several propellers developed to propel a hybrid glider/flight-style underwater vehicle. Due to the AUV being required to operate at largely different speeds and thrust levels between the two configurations, the propulsive subsystem needs to be capable of remaining efficient and effective across a wide range of operating conditions. Thus, the current results focus on quantifying all of the factors affecting the drive train, ranging from open-water performance of the propeller up to electro-mechanical efficiency of the magnetic coupling and geared electric motor. It is shown that, depending on the required operating point, total efficiency of the vehicle is primarily affected by non-linear low Reynolds number effects, sudden drop of gearbox efficiency at low revolutions and applied torques, as well as blade deformation, aside of the baseline propeller efficiency.

AB This paper presents a research that investigates solutions and algorithms for determining the optimum machine layout served by autonomous material handling system, like mobile robot or automated guided vehicle. Unlike previous works which solved the layout problem by optimizing the distance between facilities, in this paper the machine layout is addressed based on optimizing the travel time of the material handling system. The proposed approach can include boundary kinematic constraints of vehicle while optimizing the objective function such as velocity, acceleration, orientation, and trajectory curvature. The nonlinear constrained model is transformed to unconstrained problem using penalty method. Then, a simulated annealing-based algorithm is used to search for the optimum locations of machines among all possible feasible layouts. The simulation results showed that the proposed approach was efficient enough to use in real factories due to including a vehicle path planner integrated in an overall layout design scheme that involves searching of vehicle control parameters.

ID SAMPLE-SIZE; IMPACT
AB With the advancement of technology, sharing and autonomous driving will be the two major themes in the future transportation field, and SAVs (Shared autonomous vehicles) will combine the two things. When SAVs come to market, they will affect the transportation system, so the objective of this paper is to examine people's intentions to use SAVs and clarify the factors affecting people's intentions to use SAVs. Due to the application of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) in traffic travel research having important practical significance, this paper used an extended theory of planned behavior model to study people's intentions to use SAVs. Some important findings are found that the intention to use SAVs is directly affected by attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavior control, barrier, and effects of a public health emergency, and indirectly affected by perceived risk, technical interest, government policy, and environmental awareness. Moreover, perceived behavior control has the mediating effect between government policy and intention to use SAVs, between technical interest and intention to use SAVs, and between subjective norm and intention to use SAVs. According to the influence degree of related influencing factors, the corresponding development recommendations on SAVs development are put forward. The research results of this paper contribute to the subsequent listing of SAVs, promote the further development of intelligent transportation, and provide the scientific basis for future travel policy formulation and traffic planning.

TI Deep-Learning-Based Object Filtering According to Altitude for
   Improvement of Obstacle Recognition during Autonomous Flight
SO REMOTE SENSING
LA English
DT Article
DE computer vision; obstacle recognition; unmanned aerial vehicle
AB The autonomous flight of an unmanned aerial vehicle refers to creating a new flight route after self-recognition and judgment when an unexpected situation occurs during the flight. The unmanned aerial vehicle can fly at a high speed of more than 60 km/h, so obstacle recognition and avoidance must be implemented in real-time. In this paper, we propose to recognize objects quickly and accurately by effectively using the H/W resources of small computers mounted on industrial unmanned air vehicles. Since the number of pixels in the image decreases after the resizing process, filtering and object resizing were performed according to the altitude, so that quick detection and avoidance could be performed. To this end, objects up to 60 m in height were classified by subdividing them at 20 m intervals, and objects unnecessary for object detection were filtered with deep learning methods. In the 40 m to 60 m sections, the average speed of recognition was increased by 38%, without compromising the accuracy of object detection.

TI Data Redundancy Mitigation in V2X Based Collective Perceptions
SO IEEE ACCESS

DE Collective perception; connected and autonomous vehicles; V2X
   communications; data redundancy
ID COMMUNICATION; ASSOCIATION; NETWORKS
AB Collective perception is a new paradigm to extend the limited horizon of individual vehicles. Incorporating with the recent vehicle-2-x (V2X) technology, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can periodically share their sensory information, given that traffic management authorities and other road participants can benefit from these information enormously. Apart from the benefits, employing collective perception could result in a certain level of transmission redundancy, because the same object might fall in the visible region of multiple CAVs, hence wasting the already scarce network resources. In this paper, we analytically study the data redundancy issue in highway scenarios, showing that the redundant transmissions could result in heavy loads on the network under medium to dense traffic. We then propose a probabilistic data selection scheme to suppress redundant transmissions. The scheme allows CAVs adaptively adjust the transmission probability of each tracked objects based on the position, vehicular density and road geometry information. Simulation results confirm that our approach can reduce at most 60% communication overhead in the meanwhile maintain the system reliability at desired levels.

AB This paper presents a multibeam dual-circularly polarized (CP) reflectarray for connected and autonomous vehicles. The developed reflectarray uses one aperture to realize dual-band and multibeam operation. At each frequency band, there are two simultaneously shaped beams with different circular polarizations. Totally four beams are obtained with a single feed and each of the beams can be independently controlled. A simple but effective polarization suppression technique is introduced to suppress cross polarizations at large scan angles so the CP beam of the reflectarray can be configured to point at large angles. Thus, the present reflectarray is suitable to be applied to vehicles for reliable high data-rate satellite communications. To validate the design concept, an X-band prototype was designed, fabricated, and measured. The design concept is flexible and can be applied to the design of dual-band, dual-CP reflectarray with different frequencies ratios. Moreover, the present design can also be extended to a continuous beam-steering design by incorporating phase shifters.

AB This paper presents a discrete-time quasi-sliding mode controller for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the presence of parameter uncertainties and a long sampling interval. The AUV, named VORAM, is used as a model for the verification of the proposed control algorithm, Simulations of depth control and contouring control are performed for a numerical model of the AUV with full nonlinear equations of motion to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes when the vehicle has a long sampling interval. By using the discrete-time quiasi-sliding mode control law, experiments on depth control of the AUV are performed in a towing tank. The controller makes the system stable in the presence of system uncertainties and even external disturbances without any observer nor any predictor producing high rate estimates of vehicle states. As the sampling interval becomes large, the effectiveness of the proposed control law is more prominent when compared with the conventional sliding mode controller.

AB Urban mobility is particularly affected by technology development. This research focuses on the mobility system of cities in the foreseeable future - that is, until the 2030s. A systematic literature review (SLR) of 62 scientific documents and 52 scenarios predicted and developed by researchers are presented here, providing a comprehensive picture of current urban transport research perspectives. Based on a complex method built for this review, four scenarios ('Grumpy old transport', 'At an easy pace', 'Mine is yours', and 'Tech-eager mobility') have been created, each forecasting a different path towards future urban mobility. The scenarios so formed describe the expected role and potential of emerging mobility solutions (namely autonomous vehicles, shared mobility, and electrification) and include socio-economic and environmental perspectives. By 2030, most likely pathways are the 'At an easy pace' or the 'Mine is yours' scenarios, which means that only an incremental advance, such as a slow shift towards self-driving, electric and shared vehicle use is predicted.

AB Within the framework of the vision-based "Intelligent Stop&Go" driver assistance system for both the motorway and the inner city environment, we present a system for segmentation-free detection of overtaking vehicles and estimation of ego-position on motorways as well as a system for the recognition of pedestrians in the inner city traffic scenario. Both systems are running in real-time in the test vehicle UTA of the DaimlerChrysler computer vision lab, relying on the adaptable time delay neural network (ATDNN) algorithm. For object recognition, this neural network processes complete image sequences at a time instead of single images, as it is the case in most conventional neural algorithms. The results are promising in that using the ATDNN algorithm, we are able to perform the described recognition tasks in a large variety of real-world scenarios in a computationally highly efficient and rather robust and reliable manner.

AB The severity of vehicle-pedestrian crashes has prompted authorities worldwide to concentrate on improving pedestrian safety. The situation has only become more urgent with the approach of automated driving scenarios. The Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) model, introduced by Mobileye & REG;, is a rigorous mathematical model developed to facilitate the safe operation of automated vehicles. The RSS model has been calibrated for several vehicle conflict scenarios; however, it has not yet been tested for pedestrian safety. Therefore, this study calibrates and evaluates the RSS model for pedestrian safety using data from the Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study. Nearly 400 vehicle-pedestrian conflicts were extracted from 8,000 trips by the threshold and manual check method, and then divided into 16 basic scenarios in three categories. Because crossing conflicts were the most serious and frequent, they were reproduced in MATLAB's Simulink with each vehicle replaced with a virtual automated vehicle loaded with the RSS controller module. With the objectives of maximizing safety and minimizing conservativeness, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II was applied to calibrate the RSS model for vehicle-pedestrian conflicts. The safety performance of the RSS model was then compared with that of the commonly used active safety function, autonomous emergency braking (AEB), and with human driving. Findings verified that the RSS model was safer in vehicle-pedestrian conflicts than both the AEB model and human driving. Its performance also yielded the best test results in producing smooth and stable driving. This study provides a reliable reference for the safe control of automated vehicles with respect to pedestrians.

ID MODEL
AB Autonomous vehicles (AV) technology is designed for replacing conventional transportation systems ahead of energy conservation, pollution control, accident prevention, etc. The benefits of AV are feasible by the incorporation of information technology and connected infrastructures. These provide seamless support for driving and navigation assistance with the knowledge of the environment. However, the vehicles' independent assistance relies on the cooperative nature of the neighbors and infrastructure units. In this article, assisted cooperative decision-support (ACDS) is proposed for improving the spontaneous decisions for vehicle connectivity and navigation issues. The interrupt due to multiple connectivity issues from a specific infrastructure region is addressed for leveraging the decision support for AVs. In this decision-making process, neural learning is used for improving the analysis of radial inputs. The learning process categorizes connectivity and outage information based on the assisted navigation ratio between the neighbors and infrastructures. This helps to provide flexible, cooperative analysis in different navigation scenarios, promoting accuracy, and reducing the input complexity. The performance of ACDS is verified using outage, complexity, analysis time, and accuracy measures.

AB In this paper, we present a novel method for highly-scalable coordination of free-ranging automated guided vehicles in industrial logistics and manufacturing scenarios. The primary aim of this method is to enhance the current industrial state-of-the-art multi-vehicle transportation systems, which, despite their long presence on the factory floor and significant advances over the last decades, still rely on a centralized controller and predetermined network of paths. In order to eliminate the major drawbacks of such systems, including poor scalability, low flexibility, and the presence of a single point of failure, in the proposed control approach vehicles autonomously execute their assigned pick-up and delivery operations by running a fully decentralized control algorithm. The algorithm integrates path planning and motion coordination capabilities and relies on a two-layer control architecture with topological workspace representation on the top layer and state-lattice representation on the bottom layer. Each vehicle plans its own shortest feasible path toward the assigned goal location and resolves conflict situations with other vehicles as they arise along the way. The motion coordination strategy relies on the private-zone mechanism ensuring reliable collision avoidance, and local negotiations within the limited communication radius ensuring high scalability as the number of vehicles in the fleet increases. We present experimental validation results obtained on a system comprising six Pioneer 3DX robots in four different scenarios and simulation results with up to fifty vehicles. We also analyze the overall quality of the proposed traffic management method and compare its performance to other state-of-the-art multi-vehicle coordination approaches.

AB This paper proposes the lightweight autonomous vehicle self-diagnosis (LAVS) using machine learning based on sensors and the internet of things (IoT) gateway. It collects sensor data from in-vehicle sensors and changes the sensor data to sensor messages as it passes through protocol buses. The changed messages are divided into header information, sensor messages, and payloads and they are stored in an address table, a message queue, and a data collection table separately. In sequence, the sensor messages are converted to the message type of the other protocol and the payloads are transferred to an in-vehicle diagnosis module (In-VDM). The LAVS informs the diagnosis result of Cloud or road side unit(RSU) by the internet of vehicles (IoV) and of drivers by Bluetooth. To design the LAVS, the following two modules are needed. First, a multi-protocol integrated gateway module (MIGM) converts sensor messages for communication between two different protocols, transfers the extracted payloads to the In-VDM, and performs IoV to transfer the diagnosis result and payloads to the Cloud through wireless access in vehicular environment(WAVE). Second, the In-VDM uses random forest to diagnose parts of the vehicle, and delivers the results of the random forest as an input to the neural network to diagnose the total condition of the vehicle. Since the In-VDM uses them for self-diagnosis, it can diagnose a vehicle with efficiency. In addition, because the LAVS converts payloads to a WAVE message and uses IoV to transfer the WAVE messages to RSU or the Cloud, it prevents accidents in advance by informing the vehicle condition of drivers rapidly.

AB This literature review investigates how self-driving autonomous delivery robots (ADRs) impact last-mile deliveries, add value to the logistics and transport industry, and contribute to creating competitive business models. Autonomous vehicles are still a developing technology and ADRs could possibly be one of the solutions to the last-mile problem, in particular in cities and for urban freight with an increasing number of parcels to deliver. Last-mile delivery is also changing as e-commerce and more demanding customers emerge. Such development, however, faces challenges regarding infrastructure, externalities such as CO2 emissions, and shorter delivery-time requirements. This review, focused on ADRs, reveals four major themes (operations, infrastructure, regulations, and acceptance) through which we explain the barriers and benefits of using ADRs for last-mile deliveries. The review shows that the operations of ADRs can impact last-mile deliveries by lowering costs, optimising the use of time, and reducing externalities. The review also shows that the foundation of last-mile infrastructure would have to change if ADRs are to be used to a greater extent. Regulations for ADRs are still not yet in place, which makes the market somewhat confused. The acceptance of ADRs in society is another challenge because the innovation of ADRs is still new and unfamiliar. Altogether, the use of ADRs for last-mile deliveries shows great potential, based on the promising results of the articles reviewed. However, most studies on ADRs have been theoretical in nature, such as models, which highlights the need for real-world case studies and implementations.

AB An essential prerequisite for autonomous vehicles deploying in urban scenarios is the ability to accurately recognize the behavioral intentions of pedestrians and other vulnerable road users and take measures to ensure their safety. In this paper, a spatial-temporal feature fusion-based multi-attention network (STFF-MANet) is designed to predict pedestrian crossing intention. Pedestrian information, vehicle information, scene context, and optical flow are extracted from continuous image sequences as feature sources. A lightweight 3D convolutional network is designed to extract temporal features from optical flow. Construct a spatial encoding module to extract the spatial features from the context. Pedestrian motion information are re-encoded using a collection of gated recurrent units. The final network structure is created through ablation research, which introduces attention mechanisms into the network to merge pedestrian motion features and spatio-temporal features. The efficiency of the suggested strategy is demonstrated by comparison experiments on the datasets JAAD and PIE. On the JAAD dataset, the intent recognition accuracy is 9% more accurate than the existing techniques.

AB This paper presents a study on how cooperation versus non-cooperation, and centralization versus distribution impact the performance of a traffic game of autonomous vehicles. A model using a particle-based, Lagrange representation, is developed, instead of an Eulerian, flow-based one, usual in routing problems of the game-theoretical approach. This choice allows representation of phenomena such as fuel exhaustion, vehicle collision, and wave propagation. The elements necessary to represent interactions in a multi-agent transportation system are defined, including a distributed, priority-based resource allocation protocol, where resources are nodes and links in a spatial network and individual routing strategies are performed. A fuel consumption dynamics is developed in order to account for energy cost and vehicles having limited range. The analysis shows that only the scenarios with cooperative resource allocation can achieve optimal values of either collective cost or equity coefficient, corresponding respectively to the centralized and to the distributed cases.

AB Autonomous coverage of a specified area by robots operating in close proximity with each other has many potential applications such as real-time monitoring of rapidly changing environments, and search and rescue; however, coordination and safety are two fundamental challenges. For coordination, we propose a distributed controller for covering moving, compact domains which consists in a double integrator with bounded input forces. This control policy is based on artificial potentials and alignment forces designed to promote desired vehicle-domain and intervehicle separations and relative velocities. We prove that certain coverage configurations are locally asymptotically stable. For safety, we establish energy conditions for collision-free motion and utilize Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability theory for last-resort pairwise collision avoidance. We derive an analytical solution to the associated HJ partial differential equation corresponding to the collision avoidance problem between two double integrator vehicles. We demonstrate our approach in several numerical simulations involving vehicles covering convex and nonconvex moving domains.

AB This work solves the robust passive fault-tolerant control problem for autonomous electric vehicles based on an adaptive event triggered mechanism. Firstly, given the system uncertainties from the tire dynamics and the longitudinal speed, the T-S fuzzy model method is used to approximate the vehicle lateral dynamics. Secondly, taking the communication constraints caused by band-limited networks into account, an adaptive event-triggered scheme is introduced in the process of the control design. Moreover, the asynchronous constraint of the weight function between the controller and system is considered. Thirdly, considering that the actuator faults are inevitably encountered in the control system, a robust passive fault-tolerant control method is proposed to improve vehicle performances. Finally, simulations are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach. (c) 2021 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The development of complex self-adaptive systems has accelerated rapidly over the past decade, led by the Department of Defense, which has sought to develop and field military systems, such as unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles, with elevated levels of autonomy to accomplish their mission with reduced funding and manpower. As their role increases, such systems must be able to adapt and learn, and make nondeterministic decisions. To field such systems requires extensive testing, evaluation, verification, and validation-a challenging task. To address this, we apply a novel systems perspective to develop a framework to predict future system performance based on the complexity of the operating environment using newly introduced complexity measures and learned costs. In this paper, we consider an autonomous military ground robot navigating in complex off-road environments. Using our model and experimental data from Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency-led experiments, we demonstrate the accuracy with which our model can predict system performance and then validate our model against other experimental results.

TI Driver Behavior at a Freeway Merge to Mixed Traffic of Conventional and
   Connected Autonomous Vehicles
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID MODEL
AB Freeway merge ramps serve as one of the most challenging areas in traffic operations. This paper primarily focuses on creating a mixed traffic of conventional and connected/autonomous vehicles (CAVs) on freeways, and capturing driver behaviors both for the merging vehicle on the ramp and the freeway vehicles. The mixed distribution of vehicle headways of the freeway vehicles, developed based on various market penetration rates of the CAVs, was used to randomly generate vehicles through Monte Carlo simulation, and assigned as headways in a driving simulator. Based on perception, young drivers on the merge ramp were observed to choose critical headway gaps of 2.9 s, 1.8 s, and 1.7 s for freeway traffic of 0%, 50%, 75% penetration rates, respectively. For similar CAV penetration rates, the critical gaps observed for elderly drivers were 3.5 s, 2.0 s, and 1.9 s, respectively. When actually driving in the simulator, for the scenarios of 0% CAVs and 50% CAVs on the freeway, the values of average headway gaps accepted by young drivers were estimated as 2.36 s and 1.53 s, respectively. For the elderly drivers driving the simulator, the average headway gap values accepted were estimated as 2.72 s and 1.55 s, respectively, in the 0% and 50% penetration rates on the freeway traffic. Analyses of the speed profiles of the vehicles showed the effects of the acceleration/deceleration of merging vehicles, for both young and older drivers, on the freeway vehicles, including a few cases of collision. Overall, it was observed that the subject drivers accepted shorter headway gaps for increased CAV penetration levels.

AB Ocean survey is more difficult than land-based investigation, since the underwater vehicles are susceptible to being swept away by sea currents. Present study proposes a new concept of underwater vehicle, in which the robot is moored by a tether and utilizes the sea current for movement. Two tether mooring type of underwater vehicles, named "Anchor Diver I" and "Anchor Diver II", will be introduced in this paper. Anchor Diver I is an AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles) developed for long-term ocean survey and Anchor Diver II is a ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicles) which moves with a principle similar to flying a kite in the sky.

AB The trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles is the basis for reasonable decision-making of autonomous vehicles (AV), which is helpful for improving their safety and comfort. Aiming to predict lane-changing trajectories, we propose a behavior-based method of predicting diverse lane-changing trajectories of surrounding vehicles, which includes two parts: lane-changing behavior recognition and diverse lane-changing trajectory prediction. Firstly, a lane-changing behavior recognition model based on the Continuous Hidden Markov Model (CHMM) is established to identify the lane-changing behavior of surrounding vehicles. Secondly, considering the driving styles will lead to diverse lane-changing patterns, a diverse lane-changing trajectory prediction method based on LSTM is proposed to predict three lane-changing trajectories when the driving style is unknown, which is composed of three LSTM trajectory generators representing three lane-changing patterns. Finally, the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset is used to train, validate and test the behavior recognition model and the trajectory prediction model. The results show good accuracy and anticipative ability of the behavior recognition model. The average accuracy of surrounding vehicle behavior detection is 98.98%, the accuracy of surrounding vehicle behavior detection in 2s before lane change point is above 95%, the average anticipation time of left and right lane-changing behavior recognition is 3.24s and 3.71s, the average proportion of anticipation time in the lane-changing duration time is 46.78% and 55.54%. In the trajectory prediction section, with considering the diversity of lane changing trajectory caused by driving style, the proposed method for predicting diverse lane-changing trajectories reduces the error between the predicted and actual trajectories. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the Final Displacement Error (FDE) of the longitudinal and lateral positions are reduced by more than 21% over a 5s time horizon. In conclusion, the diverse trajectory prediction method based on the early detection of lane-changing behavior can provide AV with future trajectory of other vehicle under different driving styles, which is conducive to a more comprehensive and accurate driving risk assessment.

AB The importance of vehicle security has increased in recent years in the automotive field, drawing the attention of both the industry and academia. This is due to the rise in cybersecurity threats caused by (1) the increase in vehicle connectivity schemes, such as the Internet of Things, vehicle-to-x communication, and over-the-air updates, and (2) the increased impact of such threats because of the added functionalities that are controlled by vehicle software. These causes and threats are further amplified in autonomous vehicles, which are generally equipped with more electronic control units (ECUs) that are connected through controller area networks (CANs). Due to the holistic nature of CANs, attacks on the networks can affect the functionality of all vehicle ECUs and the whole system. This can lead to a breach of privacy, denial of services, alteration of vehicle performance, and exposure to safety threats. Although cryptographic encryption and authentication algorithms and intrusion detection systems (IDS) are currently being used to detect and prevent CAN bus attacks, they have certain limitations. Therefore, this study proposed a mitigation scheme that can detect and prevent such attacks at the ECU level, which could address the limitations of existing algorithms. This study proposed the usage of a secure boot scheme to detect and prevent the execution of malicious codes, as the presence of one or more ECUs with a malicious code is the root cause of most CAN bus attacks. Secure boot schemes apply cryptographic data integrity algorithms to ensure that only authentic and untampered software can run on the vehicle's ECUs. The selection of an appropriate cryptographic algorithm is important because it affects the secure boot schemes' security level and performance. Therefore, this study also tested and compared the performance of the proposed secure boot scheme with five different data security algorithms implemented using the hardware security module (HSM) of the TC399 32-bit AURIX (TM) TriCore (TM) microcontroller through an electric autonomous vehicle's control unit. The tests showed that the two most favorable schemes with the selected hardware are the secure boot scheme with the cipher-based message authentication code (CMAC), because it possesses the highest performance with an execution rate of 26.07 (ms/MB), and the secure boot scheme with the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA), because it provides a higher security level with an acceptable compromise in speed. This study also introduced and tested a novel variation of the ECDSA algorithm based on the CMAC algorithm, which was found to have a 19% performance gain over the standard ECDSA-based secure boot scheme.

AB Rear-end collision avoidance relies on mathematical models to calculate the safety distance. Vehicle deceleration is a key parameter for the accuracy of the models. Current models, however, assume a constant deceleration during braking, which is unrealistic. This assumption results in large over-approximation / under-approximation. In this paper, we rectify this limitation by proposing a new model that accounts for realistic vehicle deceleration during braking. Simulation results show that our approach guarantees safety. Moreover, traffic flow is improved by 21.6% compared to the widely adopted the Berkeley algorithm.

AB Fluctuating demand for public transport (PT) is one of the main reasons for unreliable PT service, and subsequent passenger frustration at being left behind at PT stops. A novel way to solve this situation is to optimally use autonomous PT vehicles with coupling and decoupling (C&D) of vehicle units to accommodate the fluctuating PT demand and reliability issues. In this way, vehicle size is added as a variable of the problem. This work proposes a new class of C&D tactics in the process of solving the problems of PT route timetabling subject to passenger demand. Resolving the optimisation problem involves determining the C&D arrangement at stops/stations to accommodate the C&D options and departure times. The validation of the model is performed by a small example and a real case study with a bilevel heuristic algorithm that manages to completely (100%) eliminate left-behind passengers using practical, even-headway, and even-load timetables.

AB Mediating the divergent interest of vehicle stability and strengthened path tracking performance when aiming at the design of a path tracking controller for autonomous vehicles is a challenging issue. Accordingly, this paper proposes an improved-LQR (linear quadratic regulator) control applied using an improved path planning algorithm. A feedforward and feedback LQR control is constructed by applying the path optimization solution method, which is a different traditional polynomial trajectory fitting method, and then solving the path planning information and the control input parameter in real time to make the tracking error as convergent as possible. To verify the superiority of the improved-LQR, this study compares the proposed controller and model predictive control by the traditional path solving method on a closed-loop test road using Carsim/Simulink. The comparative results show the efficiency, accurate tracking, vehicle stability, and reliability of the proposed controller.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are the next-generation driver-less vehicular entities with advanced tech-nologies. Overtaking is an important and challenging maneuver that needs to be frequently performed in diverse environments during the run. The maneuvering of AVs, in present scenarios, improves driving precision, fuel efficiency, and travel time and minimizes road accidents caused by human error, waiting time, carbon emission, etc. Despite all these benefits, AVs face several critical issues, such as traffic safety, market issues, environmental aspects, technical compatibility, market introduction, etc. In traffic safety, the overtaking scenario is considered one of the most complex driving maneuvers out of several driving maneuvers, such as lane changing, lane following, tailgating, and many more. Despite this, to the best of authors' knowledge, an extensive study on autonomous vehicular overtaking maneuvers still needs to be explored. Therefore, this survey aims to visualize the current methods used to enhance traffic safety in an intelligent transport system by handling the most complex driving maneuver in autonomous driving (overtaking). In this survey, we present the taxonomy, simulators, and methods used for AVs overtaking maneuver, and the state-of-the-art methods are further categorized under theoretical and AI-based tech-niques. Furthermore, the theoretical and AI-based techniques are classified based on the applications of the respective technique in overtaking maneuvers. While designing this survey, several theoretical and practical studies are taken into consideration. As the outcomes of this study, several research gaps, chal-lenges, future research directions, and open research problems in overtaking maneuvers are identified. The outcomes of this study would be helpful for the researchers to carry out their research in the do-main of AVs overtaking maneuvers. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The autonomous vehicles (AVs), like that in knight rider, were completely a scientific fiction just a few years ago, but are now already practical with real-world commercial deployments. A salient challenge of AVs, however, is the intensive computing tasks to carry out on board for the real-time traffic detection and driving decision making; this imposes heavy load to AVs due to the limited computing power. To explore more computing power and enable scalable autonomous driving, in this paper, we propose a collaborative task computing scheme for AVs, in which the AVs in proximity dynamically share idle computing power among each other. This, however, raises another fundamental problem on how to incentivize AVs to contribute their computing power and how to fully utilize the pool of group computing power in an optimal way. This paper studies the problem by modeling the issue as a market-based optimal computing resource allocation problem. In specific, we develop a software-defined network (SDN) architecture and consider a star topology where a centered AV outsources its computing tasks to the surrounding AVs for its autonomous driving. A market mechanism is developed in which the surrounding AVs sell their computing power at a cost based on their local idle computing resources. Then, we classify the tasks requested by the centered AV into two types which are task with time to live (TTL) and task without TTL, respectively. With different task types, we define corresponding cost models of the centered AV and formulate them as two minimization problems. The optimal solutions of the problems are achieved to guide the centered AV to wisely allocate computing tasks to surrounding AVs towards minimal cost. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using simulations, which show that the proposed scheme can result in the guaranteed computing performance yet the lowest costs compared with other conventional schemes.

AB New transportation technologies (e.g., electric autonomous vehicles [EAVs]) and operation paradigms (e.g., car sharing) are discussed, researched, and to a small degree also deployed in recent years in response to rising energy crises and aggravating traffic congestions. In this research, we present a station-based car-sharing service system that integrates both EAV technologies and car-sharing operations. Based on the simulation model, a dynamic and time-continuous optimization model seeking a near-optimum design of charging station location and EAV deployment is developed. By discretizing the model, we proposed a Monte Carlo simulation model to evaluate the total system cost for a given location and vehicle deployment design. A heuristic approach based on the genetic algorithm is developed to solve the system design of station location and vehicle deployment. A numerical test in Yantai City, China, is conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and to draw managerial insights into how the key parameters affect the system design.

AB Autonomous driving perceives surroundings with line-of-sight sensors that are compromised under environmental uncertainties. To achieve real time global information in high definition map, we investigate to share perception information among connected and automated vehicles. However, it is challenging to achieve real time perception sharing under varying network dynamics in automotive edge computing. In this paper, we propose a novel real time dynamic map, named LiveMap to detect, match, and track objects on the road. We design the data plane of LiveMap to efficiently process individual vehicle data with multiple sequential computation components, including detection, projection, extraction, matching and combination. We design the control plane of LiveMap to achieve adaptive vehicular offloading with two new algorithms (central and distributed) to balance the latency and coverage performance based on deep reinforcement learning techniques. We conduct extensive evaluation through both realistic experiments on a small-scale physical testbed and network simulations on an edge network simulator. The results suggest that LiveMap significantly outperforms existing solutions in terms of latency, coverage, and accuracy.

AB With the deployment of 5G, researchers and experts begin to look forward to 6G. They predict that 6G will be the key driving force for information interaction and social life after 2030. With the help of artificial intelligence (AI), 6G will be a highly autonomous closed-loop network, and will make up for 5G's shortcomings in communications, computing and global coverage, achieving "AI of things (AIoT)". In 6G life, vehicles may become another indispensable devices for people besides smartphones, and non-polluting, highly safe as well as full-autonomous vehicles will be the goal of vehicular development. In order to ensure the safe driving of future vehicles and meet the entertainment needs of passengers, it is necessary to investigate future 6G vehicular intelligence. In this paper, we will discuss its networking, communications, computing and intelligence, look into future technological developments and applications, and identify forthcoming challenges and research directions.

AB We present a dataset of several fault types in control surfaces of a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for use in fault detection and isolation (FDI) and anomaly detection (AD) research. Currently, the dataset includes processed data for 47 autonomous flights with 23 sudden full engine failure scenarios and 24 scenarios for 7 other types of sudden control surface (actuator) faults, with a total of 66 minutes of flight under normal conditions and 13 minutes of post-fault flight time. It additionally includes many hours of raw data of fully autonomous, autopilot-assisted and manual flights with tens of fault scenarios. The ground truth of the time and type of faults is provided in each scenario to enable evaluation of the methods using the dataset. We have also provided the helper tools in several programming languages to load and work with the data and to help the evaluation of a detection method using the dataset. A set of metrics is proposed to help to compare different methods using the dataset. Most of the current fault detection methods are evaluated in simulation and, as far as we know, this dataset is the only one providing the real flight data with faults in such capacity. We hope it will help advance the state of the art in AD or FDI research for autonomous aerial vehicles and mobile robots to enhance the safety of autonomous and remote flight operations further. The dataset and the provided tools can be accessed from .

AB Terrain aided navigation (TAN) technology can yield accurate navigation results in long-endurance underwater operation of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Most TAN research focus on the high-precision terrain matching algorithms. However, terrain matching algorithms estimate the position of the vehicle by observing a unique combination of features in the terrain, making it difficult to locate a vehicle with flat terrain. This paper presents a path planning method for AUV seabed TAN process to decrease positioning errors by avoiding flat areas. In this paper, a TAN path planning algorithm based on sector search is proposed. Parameters of the sector search algorithm are determined through theoretical analysis, which means the generated path can stably provide accurate TAN location results. Meanwhile, a control coefficient is proposed to maximize the terrain information contained in the sector searching area, bring out a high success rate of AUV positioning. The TAN performance of the paths generated using the proposed path planning method was verified in simulations, which show that the TAN can yield accurate positioning results stably on the path planned.

AB Magnetic sensors provide an advantageous alternative localization method, primarily focusing on localization in surroundings where GPS, other radio frequency-based, as well as optical localization do not work or has severe limitations. Suitable for distances in the meter range, such magnetic localization may in particular be useful as artificial landmarks, e.g., for automatic drift correction. To easily use such artificial landmarks, we propose an integration process based on Transducer Electronic Data Sheets. With this approach, the landmarks can be used by passing autonomous vehicles, e.g., UAVs, for re-orientation and re-calibration. During this process, all necessary information such as data formats, reference coordinates, calibration data, provider of the landmark etc. is made known to the vehicle passing by. Based on the provided so-called meta-information, the vehicle itself can decide whether and how to use the provided sensory information. To provide a certain level of trust in the landmarks and their provided information, the corresponding data sheets are certified using a digital signature.

AB A method for dynamics investigation and coupling detection between velocities of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is presented in this paper. The method is based on transformation of equations of motion, which are usually used for an underwater vehicle, into equations with a diagonal mass matrix. The obtained equations contain quasi-velocities and allow one to give a further insight into the AUV dynamics especially for an underactuated system. Some advantages of the proposed approach are discussed, too. An analytical example for a 3-DOF AUV shows possible application of the transformed equations. Moreover, the given approach is validated via simulation on a 6-DOF vehicle. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION

DT Article
AB An analysis of stability and chaotic dynamics is presented by a single-axis rate gyro subjected to linear feedback control loops. This rate gyro is supposed to be mounted on a space vehicle which undergoes an uncertain angular velocity w(Z)(t) around its spin axis. And simultaneously acceleration 6)x(t) occurs with respect to the output axis. The necessary and sufficient conditions of stability for the autonomous case, whose vehicle undergoes a steady rotation, were provided by Routh-Hurwitz theory. Also, the degeneracy conditions of the non-hyperbolic point were derived and the dynamics of the resulting system on the center manifold near the double-zero degenerate point by using center manifold and normal form methods were examined. The stability of the non-linear non-autonomous system was investigated by Liapunov stability and instability theorems. As the electrical time constant is much smaller than the mechanical time constant, the singularly perturbed system can be obtained by the singular perturbation theory. The Liapunov stability of this system by studying the reduced and boundary-layer systems was also analyzed. Numerical simulations were performed to verify the analytical results. The stable regions of the autonomous system were obtained in parametric diagrams. For the non-autonomous case in which w(Z)(t) oscillates near boundary of stability, periodic, quasiperiodic and chaotic motions were demonstrated by using time history, phase plane and Poincare maps.

AB Infrastructure-enabled autonomous driving systems have been increasingly applied in confined environments. Automated valet parking (AVP) in smart parking garages is one of the notable applications that require high-precision indoor positioning services. However, the performances of the existing wireless indoor positioning techniques, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ultra-wideband (UWB), tend to decline substantially as the working time increases and the building environment varies. In this paper, we propose a lifelong framework using crowdsourced data of fully instrumented autonomous vehicles(e.g. vehicles equipping with LiDAR), to maintain the availability and precision of indoor positioning systems. We establish a map-aided deep learning positioning correction model based on continuous data sequences, which utilizes convolution and long short-term memory (LSTM) modules to extract the spatial and temporal features of positioning errors. A local grid map generator is designed and embedded into the correction model to learn the influencing factors of errors from the building environment and facility. A deep-learning-based anomaly detector is designed to keep the lifelong stability of our framework. Based on the proposed method, we develop a lifelong UWB positioning correction system and apply it for the path tracking of AVP in a real underground parking garage. The test results show that the system can maintain positioning correction precision in the environment of varying sensor errors and reduce the positioning error by 60% and the tracking error by 40%. The study showcases an innovative infrastructure-enabled application that can accelerate the widespread use of autonomous driving systems.

AB This article is intended as a tutorial to assist engineers who want to develop and implement low-cost underwater vehicle inertial navigation systems (INS) aided by time-delayed hydroacoustic position measure-ments. A discrete-time unit quaternion error-state Kalman filter (ESKF) is used for sensor fusion. The ESKF is implemented as a feedback algorithm with reset functionality. This is motivated by the need for long -endurance autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Proprietary navigation systems do not allow users to add more measurement equations to the code if additional sensors are available. However, the open-source filter architecture presented in the article provides for this. The article also aims to make in-house development of strapdown INS accessible and affordable for vendors of low-cost AUV systems. Finally, a case study of an AUV with a standard sensor suite is included to demonstrate the performance of the ESKF aided by time-delayed position measurements.

AB This paper introduces the a framework that simplifies the process of designing and describing autonomous vehicle platooning manoeuvres which implements four design principles: Standardisation, Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Decoupling (SEAD). Although a large body of research has been formulating platooning manoeuvres, it is still challenging to design, describe, read, and understand them. This difficulty largely arises from missing formalisation. To fill this gap, we analysed existing ways of describing manoeuvres, derived the causes of difficulty, and designed a framework that simplifies the manoeuvre design process. Alongside, a Manoeuvre Design Language was developed to structurally describe manoeuvres in a machine-readable format. Unlike state-of-the-art manoeuvre descriptions that require one state machine for every participating vehicle, the SEAD framework allows describing any manoeuvre from the single perspective of the platoon leader. We hope that the SEAD framework will pave the way for further research in the area of new manoeuvre design and optimisation by largely simplifying and unifying platooning manoeuvre representation.

AB Utilizing autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) in the last-mile delivery of parcels is regarded as the ultimate disruptive technology that might significantly reduce the GHG emissions in the freight sector. This study estimates the CO(2)e emissions for UAVs under different policies compared to diesel and electric ground delivery modes. First, the international UAV flight regulations are synthesized and classified into three groups representing varying degrees of policy strictness. Second, utilizing real-word delivery demand data, full-day parcel-delivery operations of a three-digit postal code area in both urban and rural contexts are simulated for UAVs and ground delivery modes. The results show that in general, UAVs produce significantly lower emissions compared to ground delivery per parcel-km and up to 35% compared to electric vehicles. However, UAV emissions are highly dependent on the fuel mix used in electricity generation. In urban contexts, UAV policy strictness can increase GHG emissions by up to 400%.

AB When making trips in urban environments, cyclists lose time as they stop and idle at signalized intersections. The main objective of this study was to show how augmenting the situational awareness of traffic signal controllers, using observations from moving sensor platforms, can enable prioritization of cyclists and reduce lost time within the control cycle in an effective way. We investigated the potential of using observations from connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) as a source of new information, using a revised vehicle-actuated controller. This controller exploits CAV-generated observations of cyclists to optimize the control for cyclists. The results from a simulation study indicated that with a low CAV penetration rate, prioritizing cyclists by tracking reduced cyclist delays and stops, even with a small field of view. As the delay of car directions were not taken into account in this study, the average car delay increased considerably with an increasing number of cyclists. Future work is needed to optimize the control that balances the delays and stops of cyclists and cars.

AB Precise understanding of the mobility is essential for high performance autonomous tracked vehicles in challenging circumstances, though the complex track/terrain interaction is difficult to model. A slip model based on the instantaneous centers of rotation (ICRs) of treads is presented and identified to predict the motion of the vehicle in a short term. Unlike many research studies estimating current ICRs locations using velocity measurements for feedback controllers, we focus on predicting the forward trajectories by estimating ICRs locations using position measurements. ICRs locations are parameterized over both tracks rolling speeds and the kinematic parameters are estimated in real time using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) without requiring prior knowledge of terrain parameters. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm performs better than the traditional method when the pose measuring frequencies are low. Experiments are conducted on a tracked vehicle with a weight of 13.6 tons. Results demonstrate that the predicted position and heading errors are reduced by about 75% and the reduction of pose errors is over 24% in the absence of the real-time kinematic global positioning system (RTK GPS).

AB The automatic control of a vehicle's steering wheel is now one of the most important challenges in the Intelligent Transportation Systems field. In this paper, we present a fuzzy logic-based automatic steering control system for mass-produced electric power steering (EPS) wheel-equipped vehicles that assures human-like behavior. In the literature, we find a lot of theoretical proposals and some simulations, but only a few work teams offer real solutions for this task. One such solution is the work developed by the Autopia Program in which some vehicles have been automated and can perform some maneuvers mimicking human reactions. In this paper, we use the EPS of a Citroen C3 Pluriel to effect the car's behavior. The actuator is controlled from an onboard computer housing a fuzzy logic-based autonomous steering system. The vehicle's internal computers generate the input information, which is read by a CAN bus and a high precision GPS. Some experiments using this equipment on a private test circuit are presented, obtaining an human-like behavior in all the maneuvers.

AB This article studies the informative trajectory planning problem of an autonomous vehicle for field exploration. In contrast to existing works concerned with maximizing the amount of information about spatial fields, this work considers efficient exploration of spatiotemporal fields with unknown distributions and seeks minimum-time trajectories of the vehicle while respecting a cumulative information constraint. In this work, upon adopting the observability constant as an information measure for expressing the cumulative information constraint, the existence of a minimum-time trajectory is proven under mild conditions. Given the spatiotemporal nature, the problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), for which a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to learn a continuous planning policy. To accelerate the policy learning, we design a new reward function by leveraging field approximations, which is demonstrated to yield dense rewards. Simulations show that the learned policy can steer the vehicle to achieve an efficient exploration, and it outperforms the commonly-used coverage planning method in terms of exploration time for sufficient cumulative information.

ID INERTIAL ODOMETRY
AB Autonomous and intelligent vehicles are multi-sensor systems operating in various environments and conditions. Due to their characteristics, inertial measurement units (IMUs) are typically the core component of such systems. However, these sensors rapidly accumulate errors due to biases and noise, degrading the positioning solution. Therefore, this article presents a positioning solution that only uses three gyroscopes and one radar. The proposed method was tested using low-cost sensors in different scenarios, such as open-sky, urban and indoor areas. The key components of the method are the invariant Kalman filters and the use of deep neural networks to estimate the forward speed of the car using the radar readings. The method was tested on a custom dataset, and our integrated solution accurately estimates the vehicle's position, velocity, and orientation. We achieved, on average, a $1.45\%$ translational error in the tested scenarios, making the proposed method a robust alternative to current IMU-based positioning methods.

ID AUTOMATED VEHICLES; COORDINATION
AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), unlike conventional cars, will utilise the whole space of intersections and cross in a lane-free order. This article formulates such a lane-free crossing of intersections as a multi-objective optimal control problem (OCP) that minimises the overall crossing time, as well as the energy consumption due to the acceleration of CAVs. The constraints that avoid collision of vehicles with each other and with road boundaries are smoothed by applying the dual problem theory of convex optimisation. The developed algorithm is capable of finding the lower boundary of the crossing time of a junction which can be used as a benchmark for comparing other intersection crossing algorithms. Simulation results show that the lane-free crossing time is better by an average of 40% as compared to the state-of-the-art reservation-based method, whilst consuming the same amount of energy. Furthermore, it is shown that the lane-free crossing time through intersections is fixed to a constant value regardless of the number of CAVs.

TI Phase Modulation-Based SINS Damping Method for Autonomous Vehicles

ID NAVIGATION SYSTEM; INITIAL ALIGNMENT; SCHEME; FILTER
AB Compared with many other types of navigation systems, the greatest advantage of strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) is entirely self-contained. It can work autonomously without any external aids. Therefore, improving the navigation accuracy of SINS in pure inertial state is of great significance especially for autonomous vehicles. Traditional damping methods of inertial navigation system (INS) for Schuler error suppressing were mainly based on a second-order or third-order damping network. However the traditional methods work fine only when the external speed information is available. If there is an error in the external speed or lack of external information, traditional methods will produce some errors in navigation outputs. So some problems still exist to be tackled down. For the purpose of solving the problems of traditional methods, a completely autonomous damping method called phase modulation-based SINS damping method (PMD for short) is proposed in this paper. Two calculation loops are established for damping of SINS. Using virtual extended inertial data, phase difference of the two loops is constructed based on the analysis of the error characteristics of SINS. By averaging the outputs of the two loops, the Schuler oscillation errors in attitude, velocity, and position are mostly suppressed. Both of the two loops keep in pure inertial state, and no external aid is required in PMD. Simulation and field experiments demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.

AB The reaction of schooling wintering herring (Clupea harengus L.) in Ofotflord in northern Norway is studied when approached by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with electrical propulsion. The reaction of herring is recorded running the AUV in the beam of the mother vessel's 38-kHz echosounder and in more detail with an onboard 120-kHz echosounder. The results indicate an insignificant reaction of herring to the approaching AUV, although some variations were observed depending on the experimental set-up. Technical uncertainty in the recordings close to the AUV transducer creates some ambiguity in the results. No reaction could be identified from the ship's sounder when the AUV passed under the vessel. Processing of the onboard echosounder data suggests a mean avoidance distance of 8.0 m in these experiments. In a realistic autonomous survey situation it is assumed that the AUV can approach as closely as 5-10 m to herring schools without affecting the acoustic observation, which makes it a potentially useful platform for hydroacoustic research and survey. More systematic studies are needed to precisely define the threshold reaction distance to the AUV, and the work should be conducted with transducers on a more silent platform than RV "Johan Hjort", which was used in this study.

AB This study explores consumers' expectations for autonomous cars in Korea, which will soon be available. We applied exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to derive consumer expectations using responses from 1,506 potential autonomous car consumers. Then, we carried out a structural equation analysis to identify relationships among expectations, attitude, and behavioral intention. Seven consumer expectations were identified; of these, convenience, safety, ethics, licensing, and monetary cost were found to have a direct effect on attitude, whereas convenience, safety, and monetary cost were found to have a direct effect on intention. In addition, we demonstrate that attitude has a significant effect on intention. Autonomous cars are driving innovation in the automotive industry, transportation systems, and consumer experience. By analyzing the main factors that affect consumers' purchasing intentions prior to the release of autonomous cars, this study provides guidance for fields preparing for the launch of autonomous cars.

AB By equipping various sensors and analyzing sensed data, vehicles can perform automatic driving; these vehicles are known as connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). In CAVs, tampered data will result in incorrect driving decisions. Hence, secure data transmission should be ensured to enable correct life-critical decisions. Untrusted resource-constrained modules allow attackers to obtain private data from CAVs, such as the key. Benefitting from trusted computing, the proposed scheme can verify the trusted status of internal modules and achieve secure data transmission by adopting the remote attestation and hash message authentication code. The scheme is proven to be secure in the random oracle model under the computational Diffie-Hellman problem. Furthermore, we perform experiments and evaluate the performance using Intel Software Guard eXtensions, which provide part of the trusted computing function. The experimental results show that the scheme could be efficient and suitable for CAVs.

AB Research on trajectory tracking is crucial for the development of autonomous vehicles. This paper presents a trajectory tracking scheme by utilizing model predictive control (MPC) and preview-follower theory (PFT), which includes a reference generation module and a MPC controller. The reference generation module could calculate reference lateral acceleration at the preview point by PFT to update state variables, and generate a reference yaw rate in each prediction point. Since the preview range is increased, PFT makes the calculation of yaw rate more accurate. Through physical constraints, the MPC controller can achieve the best tracking of the reference path. The MPC problem is formulated as a linear time-varying (LTV) MPC controller to achieve a predictive model from nonlinear vehicle dynamics to continuous online linearization. The MPC-PFT controller method performs well by increasing the effective length of the reference path. Compared with MPC and PFT controllers, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method are proved by simulations of two typical working conditions.

TI Measurements of Directional Wave Spectra and Wind Stress from a Wave

AB Methods for measuring waves and winds from a Wave Glider autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) are described and evaluated. The wave method utilizes the frequency spectra of orbital velocities measured by GPS, and the wind stress method utilizes the frequency spectra of turbulent wind fluctuations measured by an ultrasonic anemometer. Both methods evaluate contaminations from vehicle motion. The methods were evaluated with 68 days of data over a full range of open ocean conditions, in which wave heights varied from 1 to 8m and wind speeds varied from 1 to 17 ms(-1). Reference data were collected using additional sensors on board the vehicle. For the waves method, several additional datasets are included that use independently moored Datawell Waverider buoys as reference data. Bulk wave parameters are determined within 5% error with biases of less than 5%. Wind stress is determined within 4% error with 1% bias. Wave directional spectra also compare well, although the Wave Glider results have more spread at low frequencies.

ID INVERSE NEURAL-NETWORK; PERFORMANCE
AB The role of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is more important in the quest to reach the deep seas today than ever before. The hull shape of the AUV can differ depending on the special mission considered for the vehicle. Therefore, different types of algorithms for the body shape design of these kinds of vehicles are being developed every day. In the current work, a new procedure has been proposed for designing the body shape of an AUV. Using this method which is based on a desired pressure distribution, it is possible to obtain the desired hull shape design. Artificial neural network algorithm has been used for this purpose. Preliminary data for training and testing of the network have been obtained from CFD simulation of the flow around the body of Hydrolab500 AUV. In this regard, pressure distribution has been evaluated around each body by changing the nose and tail profile of AUV. The results obtained from this research indicate that a body correlated to the desired pressure can be designed properly.

AB With the recent emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, autonomous vehicle industry has rapidly adopted this technology to investigate self-driving systems based on AI technology. Although autonomous driving is frequently used in high-speed environments, most studies are conducted on low-speed driving on complex urban roads. Currently, most commercialized self-driving cars in SAE autonomous driving level 2 provide practical performance on high-speed roads using various sensors. However, these systems have to process huge sensor data and apply complex control algorithms. Recently, studies have been conducted on the use of image-based end-to-end deep learning to control autonomous driving systems that can be configured at a low cost without expensive sensors and complex processes. In this study, we proposed an autonomous driving control system using a novel end-to-end deep learning model for high-speed environments, and also compared the performance of the proposed system with NVIDIA end-to-end driving system.

AB This paper presents a Monte Carlo localization algorithm for an autonomous car based on an integration of multiple sensors data. The sensor system is composed of onboard motion sensors, a low-cost GPS receiver, a precise digital map, and multiple cameras. Data from the onboard motion sensors, such as yaw rate and wheel speeds, are used to predict the vehicle motion, and the GPS receiver is applied to establish the validation boundary of the ego-vehicle position. The digital map contains location information at the centimeter level about road surface markers (RSMs), such as lane markers, stop lines, and traffic sign markers. The multiple images from the front and rear mono-cameras and the around-view monitoring system are used to detect the RSM features. The localization algorithm updates the measurements by matching the RSM features from the cameras to the digital map based on a particle filter. Because the particle filter updates the measurements based on a probabilistic sensor model, the exact probabilistic modeling of sensor noise is a key factor to enhance the localization performance. To design the probabilistic noise model of the RSM features more explicitly, we analyze the results of the RSM feature detection for various real driving conditions. The proposed localization algorithm is verified and evaluated through experiments under various test scenarios and configurations. From the experimental results, we conclude that the presented localization algorithm based on the probabilistic noise model of RSM features provides sufficient accuracy and reliability for autonomous driving system applications.

   Q network; path following
ID BEHAVIOR
AB Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) plays an increasingly important role in ocean exploration. Existing AUVs are usually not fully autonomous and generally limited to pre-planning or pre-programming tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) and deep reinforcement learning have been introduced into the AUV design and research to improve its autonomy. However, these methods are still difficult to apply directly to the actual AUV system because of the sparse rewards and low learning efficiency. In this paper, we proposed a deep interactive reinforcement learning method for path following of AUV by combining the advantages of deep reinforcement learning and interactive RL. In addition, since the human trainer cannot provide human rewards for AUV when it is running in the ocean and AUV needs to adapt to a changing environment, we further propose a deep reinforcement learning method that learns from both human rewards and environmental rewards at the same time. We test our methods in two path following tasks & x2014;straight line and sinusoids curve following of AUV by simulating in the Gazebo platform. Our experimental results show that with our proposed deep interactive RL method, AUV can converge faster than a DQN learner from only environmental reward. Moreover, AUV learning with our deep RL from both human and environmental rewards can also achieve a similar or even better performance than that with deep interactive RL and can adapt to the actual environment by further learning from environmental rewards.

AB A direct or indirect network effect is defined as the phenomenon where the number of users of a product/service or the number of complementary products of a product/service increases the value of that product/service. In case of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), the value to consumers is positively affected by the number of users and interoperable road facilities, so the network effect is important in CAV diffusion. In this study, we empirically analyzed the direct and indirect network effects on CAV adoption from the perspective of consumer preference. We conducted a choice experiment and derived the consumer utility function with a mixed logit model. We considered the percentage of CAVs on the road (i.e., the number of CAV users) and ICT infrastructure coverage (i.e., the level of complimentary CAV services) for the direct and indirect network effect, exclusive CAV lanes, autonomous driving technology, fuel efficiency, and price as key attributes of CAVs. We found empirical evidence that there is extensive heterogeneity among consumers regarding CAV attributes, and that potential CAV consumers are influenced highly by the indirect network effect followed by the direct network effect. Based on scenario analyses, we suggest some government policies and corporate strategies for CAV market.

AB Shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEVs) have recently attracted significant public interest. The dynamic ride-sharing using SAEVs appears to have the advantages of reducing travel costs and relieving urban traffic congestion. It is meant to improve the practical application value of the dynamic ride-sharing mode of SAEVs. In this paper, to reduce the solution time complexity, a pre-matching algorithm considering the driverless and charging characteristics of SAEVs is developed, and then a two-stage, graph-based many-to-one ride-matching (GMOM) algorithm is proposed for the dynamic ride-sharing problem in the Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand system (AMOD). The dataset from DiDi during the peak travel time and the real-time traffic flow from the AutoNavi map were used to verify the effects of the method. The results demonstrate that the GMOM approach can effectively reduce computational complexity and improve user satisfaction. The dynamic ride-sharing mode based on the GMOM algorithm has a 5.67% higher service rate and 45.56% more vehicle calls than the non-ride-sharing mode under the same conditions. It is found that the cost-effectiveness of using ride-sharing services is relatively high for 10-20 km trips during peak travel time and the dynamic ride-sharing may extend total travel time but will reduce passengers' waiting time.

AB Computer simulation based on digital twin is an essential process when designing self-driving cars. However, designing a simulation program that is exactly equivalent to real phenomena can be arduous and cost-ineffective because too many things must be implemented. In this paper, we propose the method using the online game GTA5 (Grand Theft Auto5), as a groundwork for autonomous vehicle simulation. As GTA5 has a variety of well-implemented objects, people, and roads, it can be considered a suitable tool for simulation. By using OpenCV (Open source computer vision) to capture the GTA5 game screen and analyzing images with YOLO (You Only Look Once) and TensorFlow based on Python, we can build a quite accurate object recognition system. This can lead to writing of algorithms for object avoidance and lane recognition. Once these algorithms have been completed, vehicles in GTA5 can be controlled through codes composed of the basic functions of autonomous driving, such as collision avoidance and lane-departure prevention. In addition, the algorithm tested with GTA5 has been implemented with a programmable RC car (Radio control car), DonkeyCar, to increase reliability. By testing those algorithms, we can ensure that the algorithms can be conducted in real time and they cost low power and low memory size. Therefore, we have found a way to approach digital twin technology one step more easily.

AB Augmented intelligence is an innovative amplification of artificial intelligence that allows human experts to take over the autonomous decision of machines. It also facilitates human-intelligence-based decisions on the network edge using low-cost and small-sized devices. Augmented intelligence and the Internet of Things collectively create augmented intelligence of things. It logically and effortlessly interrelates human intelligence to articulate smart decisions. Unmanned aerial vehicles find various applications ranging from search operations during disasters to intruders identification; thus, they are suitable for aerial networks, where connections between base stations and servers are extinct. This article presents an approach to enhance the lifetime of unmanned-aerial-vehicles-enabled aerial networks via augmented intelligence. It first considers the available battery power to transform a large-size deep neural network into a lightweight. We next present a knowledge-distillation-based approach, which reduces training time and enhances accuracy. Finally, we evaluate the approach on the existing dataset.

TI LiDAR Localization by Removing Moveable Objects
SO ELECTRONICS
LA English
DT Article
DE LiDAR; NDT; autonomous vehicle; semantic segmentation
AB In this study, we propose reliable Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) mapping and localization via the removal of moveable objects, which can cause noise for autonomous driving vehicles based on the Normal Distributions Transform (NDT). LiDAR measures the distances to objects such as parked and moving cars and objects on the road, calculating the time of flight required for the sensor's beam to reflect off an object and return to the system. The proposed localization system uses LiDAR to implement mapping and matching for the surroundings of an autonomous vehicle. This localization is applied to an autonomous vehicle, a mid-size Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) that has a 64-channel Velodyne sensor, detecting moveable objects via modified DeepLabV3 and semantic segmentation. LiDAR and vision sensors are popular perception sensors, but vision sensors have a weakness that does not allow for an object to be detected accurately under special circumstances, such as at night or when there is a backlight in daylight. Even if LiDAR is more expensive than other detecting sensors, LiDAR can more reliably and accurately sense an object with the right depth because a LiDAR sensor estimates an object's distance using the time of flight required for the LiDAR sensor's beam to detect the object and return to the system. The cost of a LiDAR product will decrease dramatically in the case of skyrocketing demand for LiDAR in the industrial areas of autonomous vehicles, humanoid robots, service robots, and unmanned drones. As a result, this study develops a precise application of LiDAR localization for a mid-size SUV, which gives the best performance with respect to acquiring an object's information and contributing to the appropriate, timely control of the mid-size SUV. We suggest mapping and localization using only LiDAR, without support from any other sensors, such as a Global Positioning System (GPS) or an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor; using only a LiDAR sensor will be beneficial for cost competitiveness and reliability. With the powerful modified DeepLabV3, which is faster and more accurate, we identify and remove a moveable object through semantic segmentation. The improvement rate of the mapping and matching performance of our proposed NDT, by removing the moveable objects, was approximately 12% in terms of the Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) for the first fifth of the test course, where there were fewer parked cars and more moving cars.

AB Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) are a fleet of autonomous taxis that provide point-to-point transportation services for travellers, and have the potential to reshape the nature of the transportation market in terms of operational costs, environmental outcomes, increased tolling efficiency, etc. However, the number of waiting passengers could become arbitrarily large when the fleet size is too small for travel demand, which could cause an unstable network. An unstable network will make passengers impatient and some people will choose some other alternative travel modes, such as metro or bus. To achieve stable and reliable SAV services, this study designs a dynamic queueing model for waiting passengers and provides a fast maximum stability dispatch policy for SAVs when the average number of waiting for passengers is bounded in expectation, which is analytically proven by the Lyapunov drift techniques. After that, we expand the stability proof to a more realistic scenario accounting for the existence of exiting passengers. Unlike previous work, this study considers exiting passengers in stability analyses for the first time. Moreover, the maximum stability of the network doesn't require a planning horizon based on the proposed dispatch policy. The simulation results show that the proposed dispatch policy can ensure the waiting queues and the number of exiting passengers remain bound in several experimental settings.

ID LOCALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION; PERCEPTION
AB Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has become an indispensable sensor for autonomous vehicles due to its unique properties. Segmentation of raw point cloud is a fundamental step in the perception processing pipeline, which is critical to the safe driving of autonomous vehicles. However, some existing methods are prone to over-segmentation, insufficient segmentation, or poor real-time performance in the process of point cloud segmentation. Therefore, we propose a coarse-to-fine segmentation strategy to balance segmentation accuracy and speed. The ground segmentation includes applying robust locally weighted regression (RLWR) to the nonuniformly divided bins of polar grids in concentric model to achieve coarse ground segmentation. The processing results are mapped to a range image, and the improved range image convolution method is used to refine the ground segmentation. We evaluate the proposed method on two public datasets, and the precision, recall, and harmonic mean of the ground segmentation are all above 93%, which is sufficient to demonstrate the robustness of our method. Using the segmentation strategy from coarse to fine, the average processing time per frame of the SemanticKITTI dataset and the Nagoya dataset are 39.49 and 42.63 ms, respectively, with an average of 41.06 ms, which can meet the real-time requirements of autonomous driving.

AB In recent decades, many learning-based autonomous driving systems have been proposed, and researchers have also created toolkits for developing these systems. These toolkits allow developers to train their models easily, and then test them using simulators. Existing toolkits for learning-based autonomous driving systems have some limitations however, which include inability to reuse modules or to perform accurate comparisons with model-based systems, as well as a lack of support for middle-to-middle models. As a solution, in this paper we introduce Deepware, an end-to-end toolkit for developing and evaluating learning-based autonomous driving models. Deepware includes the tools needed for collecting and evaluating datasets, training models, and evaluating models on simulators or in real-world environments using actual vehicles. Unlike existing toolkits, we used ROS as our platform, which is a set of software frameworks for robot software development widely used in autonomous driving systems as middleware, which allows cooperation with model-based systems. This approach also allows system modules to be shared when building models. In addition, it allows the comparison of learning-based and model-based methods under the same conditions. Moreover, by extracting features from model-based systems, our toolkit can also support middle-to-middle models. The proposed Deepware toolkit and dataset are available at: https://github.com/shunchan0677/deepware.

AB Human drivers have excellent perception and reaction abilities in complex environments such as dangerous highways, busy intersections, and harsh weather conditions. To achieve human-level driving performance, autonomous driving systems require powerful environmental perception systems and the ability to make accurate decisions in difficult situations, enabling vehicles to maintain smooth driving. However, making decisions based on visual perception is still a daunting challenge for autonomous vehicles, also current end-to-end networks and modular frameworks have limitations in effectively addressing perception, decision-making, and control, such as a lack of interpretability and weak generalization ability in complex environments. This paper proposes an elaborate modular pipeline for autonomous driving that effectively integrates semantic perception information, multi-level decision tasks, and control modules. The decision-making module comprehensively considers high-level maneuver selection and low-level motion control in both horizontal and vertical directions. The proposed MP framework is trained end-to-end by a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning method with a new action sampling mechanism. To adapt to the experimental scenarios, we use the CARLA simulation platform to collect data to evaluate the proposed autonomous driving framework and its new training method, considering various environmental factors such as sunny, dusk, and rainy weather. The results show that the framework exhibits smooth and effective driving strategies in different environments and can converge quickly and stably. The method improves learning efficiency and reduces unnecessary coupling and error propagation. Overall, the proposed framework and training method provide new ideas for improving existing autonomous driving systems.

AB This paper proposes a homography-based visual servo control approach for the stabilization of underactuated unmanned aerial vehicles in GPS-denied environments. A virtual homography matrix is proposed, and a new visual error vector is defined to obtain the passivity-like visual error equation. In addition, a homography-based online translation velocity estimator and a nonlinear backstepping visual servo control approach are addressed to promote fast maneuvering without linear velocity feedback. Unlike conventional homography-based visual servo control solutions that only guarantee the local stability in the equilibrium, the proposed control scheme can get the global stability in large offset. Simulation and experimental tests with a realistic quadrotor subject to the measurement noise are carried out to verify the robustness and performance of the control approach. In addition, the autonomous tracking experiment when the target speed is unpredictable are also reported.

AB Vehicle-infrastructure cooperative perception is an ingenious way to eliminate environmental perception blind areas of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). However, if the infrastructure transmits all environmental information to the nearby CAVs, the transmission load is so heavy that it causes a waste of network resources, such as time and bandwidth, because parts of the information are redundant for the CAVs. It is an efficient manner for the infrastructure to merely transmit the information about objects which cannot be perceived by the CAVs. Therefore, the infrastructure needs to predict whether an object is perceptible for a CAV. In this paper, a machine-leaning-based model is established to settle this problem, and a data filter is also designed to enhance the prediction accuracy in various scenarios. Based on the proposed model, the infrastructure transmits the environmental information selectively, which significantly reduces the transmission load. The experiments prove that the prediction accuracy of the model achieves up to 95%, and the transmission load is reduced by 55%.

AB In recent years, the implementation of autonomous vehicles has been widely discussed world-wide. In particular, urban transportation demand is expected to change significantly when autonomous taxis (ATs) are introduced. Thus, planners must anticipate changes in traffic con-ditions and the number of users of other transport modes. Therefore, changes in travel behavior and traffic conditions must be quantified with respect to comprehensive changes in the service level of ATs, including changes in fares and the possibility of delays. However, previous studies have not sufficiently considered factors such as the intention to use ATs, the interrelationship between mode choice and traffic congestion, and the impact of ATs on public transit. Therefore, they are not applicable to city-level transportation demand forecasts. The purpose of this study was to propose an easily implementable method for forecasting urban transportation demand when AT services are adopted, which overcomes such problems. In this study, we developed a combined modal split-assignment model and analyzed the effects of various AT service imple-mentation scenarios in Nagoya, Japan. The results showed that the number of trips using taxis will increase by a factor of 11 when AT services are implemented. Additionally, the usage of other modes is expected to decrease by 4%-5%, except for rail usage with a decrease of 1.5%.

TI Learning how to dynamically route autonomous vehicles on shared roads
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
LA English
DT Article
DE Dynamic routing; Reinforcement learning; Mixed-autonomy traffic
ID CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT
AB Road congestion induces significant costs across the world, and road network disturbances, such as traffic accidents, can cause highly congested traffic patterns. If a planner had control over the routing of all vehicles in the network, they could easily reverse this effect. In a more realistic scenario, we consider a planner that controls autonomous cars, which are a fraction of all present cars. We study a dynamic routing game, in which the route choices of autonomous cars can be controlled and the human drivers react selfishly and dynamically. As the problem is prohibitively large, we use deep reinforcement learning to learn a policy for controlling the autonomous vehicles. This policy indirectly influences human drivers to route themselves in such a way that minimizes congestion on the network. To gauge the effectiveness of our learned policies, we establish theoretical results characterizing equilibria and empirically compare the learned policy results with best possible equilibria. We prove properties of equilibria on parallel roads and provide a polynomial-time optimization for computing the most efficient equilibrium. Moreover, we show that in the absence of these policies, high demand and network perturbations would result in large congestion, whereas using the policy greatly decreases the travel times by minimizing the congestion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that employs deep reinforcement learning to reduce congestion by indirectly influencing humans' routing decisions in mixed-autonomy traffic.

AB Results from a recent travel behavior survey are used to examine the impacts of generational and attitudinal factors on autonomous vehicle (AV) adoption and willingness to pay (WTP). Initial exploratory data analysis confirmed generational differences in various aspects of travel behavior. A structural equation model (SEM) was developed to capture the causal effects of different variables on AV adoption/WTP. In particular, Interaction effects with generational cohorts were analyzed. Generally, it could be inferred that WTP significantly and positively affects adoption levels, so do technology savviness, the desire for driving assistance/higher safety features, and mobility for non-drivers. The WTP is also affected by income, employment status, and previous technology experience. Further, our model suggests that millennials who appreciate the on-demand aspect of AVs are more likely to adopt a fully or partially automated vehicle. The middle-aged cohort (35-39 years old) as well as transit-user millennials are likely to have higher WTP values.

AB Unmanned, autonomous air-to-sea vehicles, fully capable of transitioning between the two mediums, have only recently become technologically possible and have attracted great interest due to their numerous applications. However, current vehicles are unable to withstand the environmental conditions of the deep sea, especially with regards to their electronics. Previous methods for protecting electronics in the deep sea are not optimized for transitions to air. Here, a novel, lightweight, thermally-conductive, easily processed, mechanically robust, epoxy-based nanocomposite coating is presented. This material was developed with the intention of bringing the multi-domain air-water drone, known as the Naviator, to the deep ocean. In this work, the coating is thoroughly characterized and demonstrated to protect electronics submerged in water at high-pressure benchtop conditions as well as in an actual deep sea mission. The coating is also contrasted against unmodified epoxy, as well as commercial syntactic foam, and deemed superior for this application.

AB This paper presents an integrated active steering control (ASC) and direct yaw control (DYC) strategy for improving path following performance of the vehicle subject to the uncertain tire-ground adhesion and road curvature conditions. To begin with, a model predictive control (MPC)-based path following controller is designed to deal with system state constraints and actuator actuation limitations. After that, a constrained weighted least square (CWLS)-based torque distributor is developed to distribute the target resultant yaw moment signal into the four executive wheels. Then, the developed control strategy and methods are implemented and evaluated on an eight degree of freedom (8DOF) nonlinear vehicle model include longitudinal, lateral, yaw, roll and four wheels' rotation dynamics. In the end, simulation results compared with ASC strategy, under the uncertain tire-ground adhesion and varied road curvature cases, confirm the feasibility and efficiency of the presented strategy and methods even subject to the uncertain tire-ground adhesion and varied road curvature.
