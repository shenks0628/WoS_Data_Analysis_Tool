AB Blockchain is an underlying technology for securing many real-time applications and their data. The automobile is one such sector in which auto-manufacturers are looking forward to accepting the advantages of distributed ledger technology in autonomous vehicles or systems and improving their products, customer satisfaction, and other valuable experiences. This work aims to find the significance of blockchain technology in Autonomous Vehicles, including Autonomous Electric Vehicles (AEV), Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV), Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGV), Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (AAeV), and Autonomous Driving. In this work, a comparative analysis of blockchain-integrated autonomous vehicle systems is explored to identify the present scenario and futuristic challenges. In addition to blockchain technology, the uses and importance of sensors, architectures and infrastructure requirements, vehicle types, driving modes, vehicles target and tracking approaches, intelligent contracts, intelligent data handling, and industry-specific use cases are also explored. This study is based on the exploration of recent technologies and practices. As autonomous vehicles are expected to be the future of intelligent transportation, this paper surveys recent advances in autonomous vehicles and systems and how blockchain can help in improving user experiences and improving industry practices. Finally, limitations of work, future research directions, and challenges associated with different autonomous vehicles and systems are presented.

AB Vehicle groups that are composed of autonomous vehicles can increase the perception range of vehicles, and their dynamic evolution can provide guidance for the operation of autonomous vehicles. Most existing studies on vehicle group formation neither propose a standard vehicle group model, nor consider vehicle mobility and dynamic topology of vehicle groups. Instead, they focus on detecting dynamic evolution without predicting it. This work proposes a dynamic evolution method for autonomous vehicle groups. It first defines five vehicle states and their transitions. Then, it proposes an autonomous vehicle group formation method based on vehicle states and formulates an autonomous vehicle group model. Next, it uses meta vehicle group sequences to manage vehicle groups at different times. Finally, it gives detection and prediction methods of vehicle group dynamic evolution. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed method can be used to establish interconnection among autonomous vehicle nodes, detect dynamic evolution characteristics inside a vehicle group precisely, and predict dynamic evolution trends of vehicle groups effectively.

AB A more critical evaluation of the actions of autonomous vehicles in comparison to those of human drivers in accident scenarios may complicate the introduction of autonomous vehicles into daily traffic. In two experiments, we tested whether the evaluation of actions in road-accident scenarios differs as a function of whether the actions were performed by human drivers or autonomous vehicles. Participants judged how morally adequate they found the actions of a non-anthropomorphized autonomous vehicle (Experiments 1 and 2), an anthropomorphized autonomous vehicle (Experiment 2), and a human driver (Experiments 1 and 2) in otherwise identical road-accident scenarios. The more lives were spared, the better the action was evaluated irrespective of the agent. However, regardless of the specific action that was chosen, the actions of the human driver were always considered more morally justifiable than the corresponding actions of the autonomous vehicle. The differences in the moral evaluations between the human driver and the autonomous vehicle were reduced, albeit not completely eliminated, when the autonomous vehicle was anthropomorphized (Experiment 2). Anthropomorphizing autonomous vehicles may thus influence the processes underlying moral judgments about the actions of autonomous vehicles such that the actions of anthropomorphized autonomous vehicles appear closer in moral justifiability to the actions of humans. The observed differences in the moral evaluation of the actions of human drivers and autonomous vehicles could cause a more critical public response to accidents involving autonomous vehicles compared to those involving human drivers which might be reduced by anthropomorphizing the autonomous vehicles.

AB This paper presents factors that affect and influence individual concern on autonomous vehicles. An ordered probit model with random parameters is applied to estimate concern about characteristics of autonomous vehicle: equipment and safety, legal liability, system and security, reaction to driving environment, and performance in poor weather condition. The analysis results show that factors such as individual age, educational level, household income, interest in owning private autonomous vehicles, number of vehicles, ownership of driver's license, and when people responded the survey have significant effects on individual concern about autonomous vehicles. The conclusion is that if characteristics of autonomous vehicles including equipment and safety, legal liability, system and security, reaction to driving environment, and poor weather performance can be addressed sufficiently, full market penetration is feasible in the future.

AB In this study, reducing motion blur in images taken by our unmanned aerial vehicle is investigated. Since shakes of unmanned aerial vehicle cause motion blur in taken images, autonomous performance of our unmanned aerial vehicle is maximized to prevent it from shakes. In order to maximize autonomous performance of unmanned aerial vehicle (i.e. to reduce motion blur), initially, camera mounted unmanned aerial vehicle dynamics are obtained. Then, optimum location of unmanned aerial vehicle camera is estimated by considering unmanned aerial vehicle dynamics and autopilot parameters. After improving unmanned aerial vehicle by optimum camera location, dynamics and controller parameters, it is called as improved autonomous controlled unmanned aerial vehicle. Also, unmanned aerial vehicle with camera fixed at the closest point to center of gravity is called as standard autonomous controlled unmanned aerial vehicle. Both improved autonomous controlled and standard autonomous controlled unmanned aerial vehicles are performed in real time flights, and approximately same trajectories are tracked. In order to compare performance of improved autonomous controlled and standard autonomous controlled unmanned aerial vehicles in reducing motion blur, a motion blur kernel model which is derived using recorded roll, pitch and yaw angles of unmanned aerial vehicle is improved. Finally, taken images are simulated to examine effect of unmanned aerial vehicle shakes. In comparison with standard autonomous controlled flight, important improvements on reducing motion blur are demonstrated by improved autonomous controlled unmanned aerial vehicle.

AB Autonomous vehicles are believed to be the next-generation technology for future societies. The energy and environmental impacts of autonomous vehicles have been realized to be important issues, but quantitative analysis is lacking. In this study, by using China's passenger vehicle fleet as an example, we evaluate the effects of autonomous vehicle deployment on greenhouse gas emissions in different scenarios of autonomous vehicle penetration rates and fuel consumption changes. A comprehensive literature review is conducted to support the study. Autonomous vehicles are found to potentially affect the total greenhouse gas emissions in multiple ways, including reducing vehicle ownership, increasing vehicle use intensity, and changing the vehicle fuel consumption rate. These impacts are mostly internally offset such that the overall impact of autonomous vehicle deployment on greenhouse gas emissions is not significant in the near-to mid-term. With a higher autonomous vehicle penetration rate achieved, in the optimistic scenario, a net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is expected to be realized. In addition, the fuel economy levels of autonomous vehicles are highly uncertain and cause major uncertainties in the simulation results. More field tests and evidence are needed to improve the evaluation reliability.

AB Dynamic robustness and stability control is a requirement for self-driving of autonomous vehicle. Longitudinal control technique of autonomous vehicle is basic theory and one key complex technique which must have the reliability and precision of vehicle controller. The longitudinal control technique is one of the foundations of the safety and stability of autonomous vehicle control. In our paper, we present a longitudinal control algorithm based on cloud model for Mengshi autonomous vehicle to ensure the dynamic stability and tracking performance of Mengshi autonomous vehicle. The longitudinal control algorithm mainly uses cloud model generator to control the acceleration of the autonomous vehicle to achieve the goal that controls the speed of Mengshi autonomous vehicle. The proposed longitudinal control algorithm based on cloud model is verified by real experiments on Highway driving scene. The experiments results of the acceleration and speed show that the algorithm is validity and stability.

AB In this study, changes in traffic flow characteristics were examined in a mixed system consisting of human drivers and autonomous vehicles. In the study, it is accepted that in the environment where the autonomous vehicles are presented, neither vehicle to vehicle communication (V2V) nor the environment and infrastructure communication of vehicles (V2I) exist. The behavioral characteristics of human drivers (reaction time, acceleration, and deceleration, etc.) are derived from data collected from field studies, while the characteristics of autonomous vehicles are determined on the basis of assumptions in literature. Using these data together, the behaviors of the different driver profiles and the movements of the autonomous vehicles under the same conditions are compared by using the SIDRA TRIP program. By using the outcomes of the program and producing different scenenarios, a passenger car equivalence value for autonomous vehicles was tried to be obtained. In the last section of the study, the effect of autonomous vehicles on signalized intersection performance in an unconnected environment is discussed. The results show that autonomous vehicles may significantly decrease intersection capacity.

AB Autonomous vehicles have the potential to disrupt the mobility system. Therefore, it is important to understand attitude formation towards autonomous vehicles. The focus of this study is on the private user's technology acceptance of an autonomous vehicle. The study applies the determinants of technology acceptance to capture users' attitude towards and intention to adopt autonomous vehicles. A field experiment with 27 participants was conducted to assess changes in determinants before and after a test ride with a level 2 automated vehicle. The automated vehicle was equipped with technology that allowed a hands-off, feet-off experience on a public road in real traffic. The results show that a ride has a positive and significant effect on attitudes towards autonomous vehicles. Additionally, participants with higher ratings of technology anxiety show a remarkable increase in attitude towards autonomous vehicles after the ride compared to participants with lower levels of technology anxiety. These findings indicate that experience with a partially automated vehicle has a potentially positive effect on the acceptance of autonomous vehicles. As such, our study illustrates the importance of continuous pilot testing with private automated vehicles to increase future user acceptance of autonomous vehicles.

AB With the rapid development of autonomous driving technology and the sharing economy, future transport systems may be a mixed traffic environment of conventional travel modes and autonomous vehicles. This study designed a travel survey with cognitive experience for autonomous vehicles to obtain the stated preference data of different commuters for multimodal travel choices. Then, discrete choice models were established, and sensitivity analysis was conducted to deeply analyze commuters' choice preferences and heterogeneity in the multimodal travel environment. It is concluded that mixed logit models incorporating cognitive and attitudinal variables are more suitable for discussing travel choice behavior for autonomous vehicles. In addition to factors related to travel modes and personal information, cognitive experiences and attitudes are the two main determinants of multimodal travel choices regarding autonomous vehicles. Increasing travelers' cognitive levels and inculcating attitudes toward autonomous vehicles through advertisements and experiences can encourage more commuters to choose private or shared autonomous vehicles. Private car commuters mainly switch to private autonomous vehicles, and public transport commuters mainly switch to shared autonomous vehicles with increasing cognitive change and inculcating attitudes toward using autonomous vehicles. The research results can provide a reference for travel behavior analysis and traffic policy formulation for different commuters in the era of autonomous vehicles.

AB Autonomous vehicles, popularly known as self-driving cars, have the potential to transform travel behavior. However, existing analyses have ignored strategic interactions with other road users. In this article, I use game theory to analyze the interactions between pedestrians and autonomous vehicles, with a focus on yielding at crosswalks. Because autonomous vehicles will be risk-averse, the model suggests that pedestrians will be able to behave with impunity, and autonomous vehicles may facilitate a shift toward pedestrian-oriented urban neighborhoods. At the same time, autonomous vehicle adoption may be hampered by their strategic disadvantage that slows them down in urban traffic.

AB The cooperation between an autonomous vehicle and a nearby vehicle is critical to ensure driving safety in the lane-exchanging scenario. The nearby vehicle trajectory needs to be predicted, from which the autonomous vehicle is controlled to prevent possible collisions. This paper proposes a lane-exchanging driving strategy for the autonomous vehicle to cooperate with the nearby vehicle by integrating vehicle trajectory prediction and motion control. A trajectory prediction method is developed to anticipate the nearby vehicle trajectory. The Gaussian mixture model (GMM), together with the vehicle kinematic model, are synthesized to predict the nearby vehicle trajectory. A potential-field-based model predictive control (MPC) approach is utilized by the autonomous vehicle to conduct the lane-exchanging maneuver. The potential field of the nearby vehicle is considered in the controller design for collision avoidance. On-road driving data verification shows that the nearby vehicle trajectory can be predicted by the proposed method. CarSim (R) simulations validate that the autonomous vehicle can perform the lane-exchanging maneuver and avoid the nearby vehicle using the proposed driving strategy. The autonomous vehicle can thus safely perform the lane-exchanging maneuver and avoid the nearby vehicle.

AB The development of autonomous vehicle or self-driving car integrates with the wireless communication technology which would be a forward step for road transportation in the near future. The autonomous crossing of an intersection with an autonomous vehicle will play a crucial role in the future of intelligent transportation system (ITS). The fundamental objectives of this work are to manage autonomous vehicles crossing an intersection with no collisions, maintaining that a vehicle drives continuously, and to decrease the waiting time at an intersection. In this paper, a discrete model of the one-way single intersection is designed. The vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication is implemented to exchange information between a vehicle and an intersection manager which is the roadside infrastructure. The safe trajectory of autonomous vehicles for the autonomous intersection management is determined and presented by using discrete mathematics.

AB In recent years, autonomous driving technology has made good progress, but the non-cooperative intelligence of vehicle for autonomous driving still has many technical bottlenecks when facing urban road autonomous driving challenges. V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) communication is a potential solution to enable cooperative intelligence of vehicles and roads. In this paper, the RGB-PVRCNN, an environment perception framework, is proposed to improve the environmental awareness of autonomous vehicles at intersections by leveraging V2I communication technology. This framework integrates vision feature based on PVRCNN. The normal distributions transform(NDT) point cloud registration algorithm is deployed both on onboard and roadside to obtain the position of the autonomous vehicles and to build the local map objects detected by roadside multi-sensor system are sent back to autonomous vehicles to enhance the perception ability of autonomous vehicles for benefiting path planning and traffic efficiency at the intersection. The field-testing results show that our method can effectively extend the environmental perception ability and range of autonomous vehicles at the intersection and outperform the PointPillar algorithm and the Voxe1RCNN algorithm in detection accuracy.

AB Autonomous electric vehicles have attracted enormous interests as an effective way to significantly improve urban transportation efficiency, reduce commute cost and the corresponding environmental burden. This work proposed a multiphysics energy model to quantify the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from an autonomous electric vehicle based on vehicle dynamics and the vehicle system energy demand. A case study is conducted on a mid-size autonomous electric vehicles taxi operating in New York City based on possible driving data and scenarios. It is found that the monthly average unit energy consumption for the autonomous electric vehicle ranges from 325 to 397 Wh km(-1), and the greenhouse gas emissions is 6.5% more from an autonomous electric vehicle with a driver than that without a driver. The study provides a physical approach for quantifying the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from an autonomous electric vehicle, and can support the sustainable development and deployment of autonomous electric vehicle technologies in future.

AB The congestion caused by ramp overflow has an essential impact on the energy consumption of autonomous vehicles. It is urgent to solve the energy waste of ramp overflow on connected and autonomous vehicles and improve the energy utilization rate. Aiming at the traffic congestion caused by ramp overflow, this paper obtains the data of autonomous vehicles and traffic flow based on vehicle road cooperative perception, analyzes the impact mechanism of vehicle energy consumption, and summarizes the energy consumption modes of autonomous vehicles into three categories. Second, an energy consumption evaluation framework is proposed based on the CSANS strategy. This strategy can make up for the deficiency of constructing neighborhoods within European distance, find important influencing variables on connected and autonomous vehicles' energy consumption, and accurately capture the manifold characteristics of energy consumption data. Finally, flow control is carried out from the macro perspective of traffic engineering to optimize ramp overflow's impact on autonomous vehicles' energy consumption. Through multiple groups of experiments, it has been found that it can effectively reduce the energy consumption of autonomous vehicles.

AB Forming a stable autonomous vehicle group is extremely challenging in a highway scene that has several entrances and exits. Existing studies focus on centralized autonomous vehicle groups with leading nodes. Such groups suffer from unbalanced computing tasks, asymmetric information, and weak stability. This article introduces a side chain consensus-based decentralized autonomous vehicle group formation method in a highway scene. First, we side chain consensus to describe states of autonomous vehicles. Then, we give decentralized autonomous vehicle group formation and maintenance methods based on side chain consensus. Finally, we conduct simulations to evaluate the quality of side chain consensus and stability of vehicle groups, which shows that our method has better properties in the balance of computing tasks, information symmetry, and stability than existing methods.

AB Autonomous driving has been achieving great progress since last several years. However, the autonomous vehicles always ignore the important traffic information on the road because of the uncertainties of driving environment and the limitations of onboard sensors. This might cause serious safety problem in autonomous driving. This study argues that the connected vehicles could share much more environmental information with each other. Therefore, a decision-making method based on reinforcement learning is proposed for V2X autonomous vehicles. First, the V2X autonomous driving architecture with three subsystems is designed. By V2V communication, an autonomous vehicle could obtain much more environmental information. Second, a reinforcement learning based model is applied to learn from the V2V observation data. A simulation environment is setup based on OpenAI reinforcement learning framework. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the V2X in autonomous driving.

AB Autonomous marine systems, such as autonomous ships and autonomous underwater vehicles, gain increased interest in industry and academia. Expected benefits of autonomous marine system in comparison to conventional marine systems are reduced cost, reduced risk to operators, and increased efficiency of such systems. Autonomous underwater vehicles are applied in scientific, commercial, and military applications for surveys and inspections of the sea floor, the water column, marine structures, and objects of interest. Autonomous underwater vehicles are costly vehicles and may carry expensive payloads. Hence, risk models are needed to assess the mission success before a mission and adapt the mission plan if necessary. The operators prepare and interact with autonomous underwater vehicles to carry out a mission successfully. Risk models need to reflect these interactions. This article presents a Bayesian belief network to assess the human-autonomy collaboration performance, as part of a risk model for autonomous underwater vehicle operation. Human-autonomy collaboration represents the joint performance of the human operators in conjunction with an autonomous system to achieve a mission aim. A case study shows that the human-autonomy collaboration can be improved in two ways: (1) through better training and inclusion of experienced operators and (2) through improved reliability of autonomous functions and situation awareness of vehicles. It is believed that the human-autonomy collaboration Bayesian belief network can improve autonomous underwater vehicle design and autonomous underwater vehicle operations by clarifying relationships between technical, human, and organizational factors and their influence on mission risk. The article focuses on autonomous underwater vehicle, but the results should be applicable to other types of autonomous marine systems.

AB Autonomous driving vehicles have some advantages, such as alleviating tasks of drivers and reducing carbon emissions. With the advancement of intelligent network connection technology, autonomous driving vehicles are showing a trend of practicality and popularization, so it is crucial to study the decision-making mechanism of autonomous driving vehicles. This paper focuses on the lane-changing decision-making behavior of autonomous driving vehicles. Firstly, the objective quantification of lane-changing intention is carried out to reasonably show the lane-changing intention of autonomous driving vehicles as a prerequisite for lane-changing decision-making. Besides, the lane-changing collision probability and the lane-changing dynamic risky coefficient are introduced, and explore the dynamic influencing factors of lane-changing process for autonomous driving vehicles. Based on the game theory, the decision-making behavior model of the lane-changing game for autonomous driving vehicles is established. Analyze the decision-making behavior mechanism of lane-changing, so that the autonomous driving vehicle can change lanes safely and reasonably. Finally, with SUMO software, the traditional LC2013 lane-changing model and the decision-making behavior model of the lane-changing game are used for simulation experiments and comparative analysis. The results show that under the decision-making behavior model of the lane-changing game, the average speed of vehicles increases by 3.6%, and the average number of passed vehicles increases by 10.3%, which has higher stability, safety, speed gains, and lane utilization. The modeling of lane-changing game strategy for autonomous driving vehicles comprehensively considers the dynamic factors in the traffic environment, and scientifically shows the lane-changing decision-making mechanism of autonomous driving vehicles.

AB Based on an online survey with 1164 participants, this paper investigates the risk perceptions and anticipation of insurance demand for autonomous vehicles in the Chinese market. The findings reveal that autonomous vehicles are highly familiar and have a positive impression in China. Of the respondents, 42.35% and 45.28% expect lower risk and lower insurance premiums for autonomous vehicles, respectively. By using one-way analyses of variance, this paper further examines the statistical effects of perception of autonomous vehicles, insurance purchases and claim experiences as well as personal information on responses to risk perception and insurance anticipation. Several significant factors were found that correlate with each other. Both the understanding of autonomous vehicles and personal information affect risk perception of autonomous vehicles, all of which collectively determine the anticipation of insurance demand for autonomous vehicles.

AB The emergence of autonomous vehicles marks a shift in mobility. Conventional vehicles have been designed to prioritize the safety of drivers and passengers and increase fuel efficiency, while autonomous vehicles are developing as convergence technologies with a focus on more than just transportation. With the potential for autonomous vehicles to serve as an office or leisure space, the accuracy and stability of their driving technology is of utmost importance. However, commercializing autonomous vehicles has been challenging due to the limitations of current technology. This paper proposes a method to build a precision map for multi-sensor-based autonomous driving to improve the accuracy and stability of autonomous vehicle technology. The proposed method leverages dynamic high-definition maps to enhance the recognition rates and autonomous driving path recognition of objects in the vicinity of the vehicle, utilizing multiple sensors such as cameras, LIDAR, and RADAR. The goal is to improve the accuracy and stability of autonomous driving technology.

AB Technological advancement has transformed traditional vehicles into autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles play an important role since they are considered an essential component of smart cities. The autonomous vehicle is an intelligent vehicle capable of maintaining safe driving by avoiding crashes caused by drivers. Unlike traditional vehicles, which are fully controlled and operated by humans, autonomous vehicles collect information about the outside environment using sensors to ensure safe navigation. Autonomous vehicles reduce environmental impact because they usually use electricity to operate instead of fossil fuel, thus decreasing the greenhouse gasses. However, autonomous vehicles could be threatened by cyberattacks, posing risks to human life. For example, researchers reported that Wi-Fi technology could be vulnerable to cyberattacks through Tesla and BMW autonomous vehicles. Therefore, further research is needed to detect cyberattacks targeting the control components of autonomous vehicles to mitigate their negative consequences. This research will contribute to the security of autonomous vehicles by detecting cyberattacks in the early stages. First, we inject False Data Injection (FDI) attacks into an autonomous vehicle simulation-based system developed by MathWorks. Inc. Second, we collect the dataset generated from the simulation model after integrating the cyberattack. Third, we implement an intelligent symmetrical anomaly detection method to identify false data cyber-attacks targeting the control system of autonomous vehicles through a compromised sensor. We utilize long short-term memory (LSTM) deep networks to detect False Data Injection (FDI) attacks in the early stage to ensure the stability of the operation of autonomous vehicles. Our method classifies the collected dataset into two classifications: normal and anomaly data. The experimental result shows that our proposed model's accuracy is 99.95%. To this end, the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art models in the same study area.

AB Autonomous vehicles, understood as vehicles that do not require manual steering, will cause disruptive changes in the transportation sector. Many studies on autonomous vehicles address the sustainability potential of this technology, and they assume that vehicles will no longer be privately owned and will be used with pooling options (multiple riders on a trip). However, there is currently little evidence to indicate whether this assumption is supported by user preference. To address this gap, an online choice experiment including 709 participants was conducted. It assumed the full-market penetration of autonomous vehicles and explored future mode choices, considering both short-term and long-term mobility decisions. The experiment tested the influence of 15 short-term and 13 long-term decision instruments to encourage the adoption of shared and pooled use of autonomous vehicles, like autonomous taxis and autonomous public transport. Our findings partly support the assumption in the existing literature that vehicles are likely to be used in a pooled mode. In the control condition, 61% of Swiss respondents preferred pooled autonomous vehicles over private autonomous cars. Moreover, stated preferences indicated that combined instruments influencing comfort, cost, and time are likely to increase the proportion of pooled uses of autonomous vehicles.

AB The impact of autonomous vehicles on the spatial size of cities remains ambiguous, as the future is highly uncertain. This paper uses counterfactual analysis techniques to examine the effects of autonomous vehicles on urban expansion for metropolitan areas in the United States if autonomous vehicles had been introduced before. We argue that distance cost and congestion cost, which are the two components of transportation cost with different effects on urban expansion, should be addressed in autonomous vehicle research. By coupling historical data with hypothetical scenarios of introducing autonomous vehicles to cities, we find that urban expansion, rather than urban densification, would have been the dominant effect if autonomous vehicles had been introduced into cities. The finding indicates that if autonomous vehicles are widely adopted in the future, they are likely to have similar, or even larger, effects on future urban expansion than in the counterfactual past.

AB Autonomous vehicles have the potential to reduce the risk of accidents as they eliminate the element of human error from driving. Lack of attention, poor judgement, or physical limitations may lead to road incidents. Thus, the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles should be a priority. However, before being publicly available, autonomous vehicles must be tested to ensure their viability and safety by conducting public road testing. Autonomous vehicles have been designed and tested since the early 1900s; however, deployment of fully autonomous vehicles on public roads only started in the 2000s. Numerous countries have developed guidelines for public road testing, but those rules are not uniform, and discrepancies occur between nations. Issues such as vehicular safety, registrations, authority, insurance, cybersecurity, and infrastructures weigh differently in each country. Synthesizing these diverse national regulations into global guidelines would promote the safety and sustainability of autonomous vehicle testing and benefit all parties interested in autonomous vehicles.

AB With the rapid development and application of autonomous technology in vehicles, we are going to see more autonomous vehicles on the roads in a foreseeable future. While autonomous vehicles may have the advantage of reducing traffic accidents caused by human drivers' neglect and/or fatigue, one of the challenges is how to develop autonomous driving algorithms such that autonomous vehicles can be safely deployed in a mixed traffic environment with both autonomous vehicles and human-driven vehicles. Instantaneous lane-changing type may be significantly different for human drivers, which would lead to traffic accidents with other vehicles including autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose a resilient algorithm for the prediction of the human driver's lane-changing behaviors. The proposed algorithm uses a long-short term memory (LSTM) classifier to identify the conservative lane change and the aggressive lane changing and accordingly makes the accurate prediction on lane changes in the driving of vehicles by human drivers. The proposed method provides a useful addition in facilitating the design of more advanced driving algorithms for autonomous vehicles. Using the vehicle trajectory data in the NGSIM data set for a large number of simulations, the effectiveness of this method has been confirmed.

AB Autonomous vehicles are expected to shift not only the driving paradigms but also the notion of vehicle ownership. Although autonomous vehicles are believed to introduce many safety, mobility, and environmental benefits, they will be initially priced relatively highly. This paper assesses the potential for circumventing this barrier by promoting a shared ownership program in which households form clusters that share the ownership and ridership of a set of autonomous vehicles. Such a program will increase the utilization rate of vehicles, making ownership of autonomous vehicles more economical. We study parameters that affect the benefits expected from autonomous vehicles, and introduce policy directions that can boost these benefits.

AB Intermediate modes of transport, such as shared vehicles or ride sharing, are starting to increase their market share at the expense of traditional modes of car, public transport, and taxi. In the advent of autonomous vehicles, single occupancy shared vehicles are expected to substitute at least in part private conventional vehicle trips. The objective of this paper is to estimate the impact of shared autonomous vehicles on average trip duration and vehicle-km traveled in a large metropolitan area. A stated preference online survey was designed to gather data on the willingness to use shared autonomous vehicles. Then, commute trips and home-based other trips were generated microscopically for a synthetic population in the greater Munich metropolitan area. Individuals who traveled by auto were selected to switch from a conventional vehicle to a shared autonomous vehicle subject to their willingness to use them. The effect of shared autonomous vehicles on urban mobility was assessed through traffic simulations in MATSim with a varying autonomous taxi fleet size. The results indicated that the total traveled distance increased by up to 8% after autonomous fleets were introduced. Current travel demand can still be satisfied with an acceptable waiting time when 10 conventional vehicles are replaced with 4 shared autonomous vehicles.

AB Autonomous vehicles must be comprehensively evaluated before deployed in cities and highways. However, most existing evaluation approaches for autonomous vehicles are static and model environmental vehicles with predefined trajectories, which ignore the time-sequential interactions between the ego vehicle and environmental vehicles. In this paper, we propose a dynamic test scenario generation method to evaluate autonomous vehicles by modeling environmental vehicles as agents with human behavior and simulating the interaction process between the autonomous vehicle and environmental vehicles. Considering the multimodal features of traffic scenarios, we cluster the real-word traffic environments, and integrate the scenario class labels into the conditional generative adversarial imitation learning (CGAIL) model to generate different types of traffic scenarios. The proposed method is validated in a typical lane-change scenario that involves frequent interactions between ego vehicle and environmental vehicles. Results show that the proposed method further test autonomous vehicles' ability to cope with dynamic scenarios, and can be used to infer the weaknesses of the tested vehicles.

AB Despite the fact that significant research efforts have been made to the traffic flow theory of autonomous vehicles and manual vehicles, few existing studies have incorporated different modes of both vehicles in their analysis. In this study, we develop a cellular automata simulation model to investigate the impact of different modes of autonomous vehicles (autonomous car, autonomous bus, and autonomous micro car) and conventional vehicles (manual car, manual bus, and manual micro car) on the characteristics of traffic flow. A new type of autonomous mode, i.e., autonomous micro car, is investigated in the model to study the effects of this vehicle mode on the overall capacity of the network. Furthermore, two types of lane-changing behavior, i.e., aggressive lane changing and polite lane changing, are incorporated into the model. The results reveal that micro cars (manual and autonomous) have the potential to reduce traffic congestions and increase the capacity or flow rate (vehicles/hour) of the road. Where the average vehicle occupancy is less than 2, if autonomous micro cars are deployed alongside autonomous cars, the flow rate (vehicles/hour) can be increased significantly. The results highlight the significance of the autonomous micro cars to traffic flow, passenger occupancy, and road capacity.

AB To understand the public's acceptance of autonomous vehicles, studies were conducted from the perspectives of personal attributes, travel demand and cognitions of autonomous vehicles based on 403 valid questionnaires. Influencing factors of whether travelers are purchasing autonomous vehicles, whether travelers without a driver's license intend to take a driver's license in the future and whether travelers are choosing an autonomous private car if travelers can only take a taxi or drive a private car are analyzed by building Logistic regression models. The results show that personal monthly income, driver's license, driving confidence, preference for autonomous vehicles and convenience of arriving at public transport stations will affect the purchase decision of autonomous vehicles; teenagers, long-distance travelers, students and employees of enterprises and institutions, those who believe that traditional taxis/taxi-hailing are unsafe, and those who lack confidence in driving have a higher probability of choosing autonomous vehicles. This research can be used to predict the probability of future purchase and use decisions for autonomous vehicles based on data from other populations.

AB Nowadays, vehicles with a high level of automation are being driven everywhere. With the apparent success of autonomous driving technology, we keep working to achieve fully autonomous vehicles on roads. Efficient and accurate vehicle detection is one of the essential tasks in the environment perception of an autonomous vehicle. Therefore, numerous algorithms for vehicle detection have been developed. However, their strengths in terms of performance have not been deeply assessed or highlighted yet. This work comprehensively reviews the existing methods and datasets for vehicle detection considering their performances and applications in the field of autonomous driving. First, we briefly describe tasks, evaluation criteria, and existing public datasets for vehicle detection in autonomous driving. Second, we provide a rigorous review of both classical and latest vehicle detection methods, including machine vision-based, mmWave radar-based, LiDAR-based, and sensor fusion-based methods. Finally, we analyze the pertinent challenges of autonomous vehicles and provide recommendations for future works concerning vehicle detection. The present review covers over 300 research works and aims to help researchers interested in autonomous driving, especially in vehicle detection.

AB This paper introduces a procedure for controlling autonomous vehicles entering roundabouts. The aim of the centralized controller is to define the velocity profile of each autonomous vehicle by which collisions can be avoided and traveling times can be minimized. To achieve these performances, a model predictive control is introduced based on the solution of an analytical calculation of traveling times spent in the roundabout and designing the autonomous vehicles' velocity profiles in order to avoid conflict situations while ensuring a time-optimal solution. By the application of the proposed procedure, safety of autonomous vehicles can be enhanced and the possibility of a forming congestion can be minimized. The operation of the proposed method is demonstrated by a few simulation examples in the CarSim simulation environment.

AB In this paper, we study how to test the intelligence of an autonomous vehicle. Comprehensive testing is crucial to both vehicle manufactories and customers. Existing testing approaches can be categorized into two kinds: scenario-based testing and functionality-based testing. We first discuss the shortcomings of these two kinds of approaches, and then propose a new testing framework to combine the benefits of them. Based on the new semantic diagram definition for the intelligence of autonomous vehicles, we explain how to design a task for autonomous vehicle testing and how to evaluate test results. Experiments show that this new approach provides a quantitative way to test the intelligence of an autonomous vehicle.

AB The general expectation is that the traffic in the cities will be almost optimal when the collective behaviour of autonomous vehicles will determine the traffic. Each member of the collective of autonomous vehicles tries to adapt to the changing environment, therefore together they execute decentralised autonomous adaptation by exploiting real-time information about their environment. The routing of these vehicles needs proper computer science models to be able to develop the best information technology for their control. We review different traffic flow models in computer science, and we evaluate their usefulness and applicability to autonomous vehicles. The classical game theory model implies flow level decision making in route selection. Non-cooperative autonomous vehicles may produce unwanted traffic patterns. Improved decentralised autonomous adaptation techniques try to establish some kind of coordination among autonomous vehicles, mainly through intention awareness. The aggregation of the intentions of autonomous vehicles may help to predict future traffic situations. The novel intention-aware online routing game model points out that intention-awareness helps to avoid that the traffic generated by autonomous vehicles be worse than the traffic indicated by classical traffic flow models. The review helps to make the first steps towards research on global level control of autonomous vehicles by highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the different formal models. The review also highlights the importance of research on intention-awareness and intention-aware traffic flow prediction methods.

   steel deck (OSD); lightweight composite OSD (LWCD); fatigue life
ID PERFORMANCE
AB The fatigue life of orthotropic steel decks (OSDs) is significantly affected by vehicle loads, and the local stress response of OSDs is sensitive to the transverse position of vehicle loads. However, the presence of autonomous vehicles is likely to change the transverse distribution of vehicles within the lane, thereby affecting vehicle-induced fatigue damage to OSDs. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the potential effect of autonomous vehicles on the fatigue life of OSDs so that appropriate strategies can be implemented to control the transverse positions of autonomous vehicles passing the bridge deck. To this end, fatigue damages of several typical fatigue details in a conventional OSD (COSD) and a lightweight composite OSD (LWCD) induced by vehicle loads were calculated based on finite element analysis, and their fatigue lives were evaluated based on Miner's Rule, in which different transverse distribution patterns of autonomous vehicles and their proportions in the mixed traffic flow were considered. The results indicate that fatigue lives of both the COSD and the LWCD can be negatively affected by autonomous vehicles traveling across the bridge without any constraints on the transverse distribution, especially when their proportion in the mixed traffic flow exceeds 30%. Compared to the scenario without autonomous vehicles, the fatigue damage of most fatigue details in OSDs may increase by 51% to 210% in the most unfavorable case due to the presence of autonomous vehicles. Nevertheless, it is feasible to extend the fatigue life of OSDs by optimizing the transverse distribution of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, the fatigue life of most fatigue details in the COSD could be extended by more than 86% in the most favorable case when a bimodal Gaussian distribution is adopted as the transverse distribution pattern of autonomous vehicles. Moreover, both the negative and positive effects of autonomous vehicles on the fatigue life of the COSD are more significant than those of the LWCD in most cases. The results can provide references for the maintenance of OSDs under the action of autonomous vehicles.

AB The recent progress in autonomous vehicle research and development has led to increasingly widespread testing of fully autonomous vehicles on public roads, where complex traffic scenarios arise. Along with these vehicles, partially autonomous vehicles, manually-driven vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, and some animals can be present on the road, to which autonomous vehicles must react. This study focuses on a comprehensive survey of the literature on motion prediction and state estimation of vehicles and VRUs, which are essential for path planning and navigation functionalities of an autonomous vehicle. Motion prediction and state estimation methods utilize the vehicle's own sensory perception capabilities and information obtained through cooperative perception from V2V and V2X connections. This survey summarizes the significant progress that has been made in both categories, discusses the most promising results to date and outlines critical research challenges that need to be overcome to achieve full autonomy, from an ego vehicle's perspective in mixed traffic environments.

AB The articles in this special section focus on fully autonomous and networked vehicles. Around 5,000 years ago, our ancestors invented the wheel, sparking generations of revolutionary innovations from the wheelbarrow to the automobile. Today, we are poised to revolutionize the wheel again. Autonomous and networked vehicles can observe their surroundings, assess their state, communicate with other vehicles, and maneuver the environment-without human intervention. Commensurate with their impact, the technologies underlying autonomous and networked vehicles are being adopted rapidly. In 2020, over 200 automobile models can autonomously manage their speed, steering or brakes.

AB Autonomous vehicles are expected to offer a higher comfort of traveling at lower prices and at the same time to increase road capacity - a pattern recalling the rise of the private car and later of motorway construction. Using the Swiss national transport model, this research simulates the impact of autonomous vehicles on accessibility of the Swiss municipalities. The results show that autonomous vehicles could cause another quantum leap in accessibility. Moreover, the spatial distribution of the accessibility impacts implies that autonomous vehicles favor urban sprawl and may render public transport superfluous except for dense urban areas.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB This paper presents a solution to the problem of providing an autonomous vehicle with a safe control task when moving around many other autonomous vehicles. This is achieved by developing an appropriate computer control algorithm that takes into account the possible risk of a collision resulting from both the impact of environmental disturbances and the imperfection of the rules of maneuvering in situations where many vehicles pass each other, giving the control process a decisive character. For this purpose, three types of algorithms were synthesized: kinematic and dynamic optimization with neural domains, as well as sequential game control of an autonomous vehicle. The control algorithms determine a safe trajectory, which is implemented by the actuators of the autonomous vehicle. Computer simulations of the control algorithms in the Matlab/Simulink software allow for their comparative analysis in terms of meeting the criteria for the optimality and safety of an autonomous vehicle when passing a larger number of other autonomous vehicles. For this purpose, scenarios of multidirectional and one-way traffic of autonomous vehicles were used.

AB Autonomous Vehicles have captured the imagination of our society and have promised a future of safe and efficient mobility. However, there is a need to understand behaviour and its consequences in the use of autonomous vehicles. Using paradigms of behavioural and experimental economics, we show that risk attitudes play a role in acceptability of autonomous vehicles, productivity in autonomous vehicles and safety under risk of failures of autonomous systems. We found that risk attitudes and age have a significant impact on these. We believe these findings will help provide guidance to insurance agencies, licensing, vehicle design, and policies around automated vehicles.

TI Vision-Based Navigation of Autonomous Vehicles in Roadway Environments
   with Unexpected Hazards
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Vision-based navigation of autonomous vehicles primarily depends on the deep neural network (DNN) based systems in which the controller obtains input from sensors/detectors, such as cameras, and produces a vehicle control output, such as a steering wheel angle to navigate the vehicle safely in a roadway traffic environment. Typically, these DNN-based systems in the autonomous vehicle are trained through supervised learning; however, recent studies show that a trained DNN-based system can be compromised by perturbation or adverse inputs. Similarly, this perturbation can be introduced into the DNN-based systems of autonomous vehicles by unexpected roadway hazards, such as debris or roadblocks. In this study, we first introduce a hazardous roadway environment that can compromise the DNN-based navigational system of an autonomous vehicle, and produce an incorrect steering wheel angle, which could cause crashes resulting in fatality or injury. Then, we develop a DNN-based autonomous vehicle driving system using object detection and semantic segmentation to mitigate the adverse effect of this type of hazard, which helps the autonomous vehicle to navigate safely around such hazards. We find that our developed DNN-based autonomous vehicle driving system, including hazardous object detection and semantic segmentation, improves the navigational ability of an autonomous vehicle to avoid a potential hazard by 21% compared with the traditional DNN-based autonomous vehicle driving system.

ID INTERSECTION
AB To reduce the impact of congestion, it is necessary to improve our overall understanding of the influence of the autonomous vehicle. Recently, deep reinforcement learning has become an effective means of solving complex control tasks. Accordingly, we show an advanced deep reinforcement learning that investigates how the leading autonomous vehicles affect the urban network under a mixed-traffic environment. We also suggest a set of hyperparameters for achieving better performance. Firstly, we feed a set of hyperparameters into our deep reinforcement learning agents. Secondly, we investigate the leading autonomous vehicle experiment in the urban network with different autonomous vehicle penetration rates. Thirdly, the advantage of leading autonomous vehicles is evaluated using entire manual vehicle and leading manual vehicle experiments. Finally, the proximal policy optimization with a clipped objective is compared to the proximal policy optimization with an adaptive Kullback-Leibler penalty to verify the superiority of the proposed hyperparameter. We demonstrate that full automation traffic increased the average speed 1.27 times greater compared with the entire manual vehicle experiment. Our proposed method becomes significantly more effective at a higher autonomous vehicle penetration rate. Furthermore, the leading autonomous vehicles could help to mitigate traffic congestion.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB The continuous development of technologies, including intelligent networking, machine vision, and new energy vehicles, has made autonomous driving vehicles a research focus. Autonomous vehicles significantly affect road performance under mixed traffic flow conditions with their excellent lateral control ability and driving stability. A finite element model is established to analyze the impact of these modes on pavement deformation under maximum air temperature in Nanjing, China. Based on the simulation results, it has been shown that lateral control of autonomous vehicles significantly reduces pavement deformation. The proportion of autonomous vehicles affects the difference in distribution modes, and the uniform distribution mode is the most favorable for horizontal distribution. Additionally, the edge lane experiences less pavement deformation than the center lane and varies more when the distribution pattern changes. By comparing the deformation of the center and edge lanes, the edge lane experiences a significant reduction in deformation under the uniform distribution mode, with a maximum reduction of 73.7%. Comparing the pavement deformation of center and edge lanes under normal distribution mode and uniform distribution mode shows that safe solutions for the lateral distribution of autonomous vehicles depend on the proportion of autonomous vehicles. The optimal driving speed for autonomous vehicles is 80 km/h under the uniform distribution model, while under the normal distribution model it is 90 km/h or 110 km/h. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the lateral control of autonomous vehicles in the future and propose safe solutions for the lateral distribution of autonomous vehicles.

AB Autonomous driving and its real-world implementation have been among the most actively studied topics in the past few years. In recent years, this growth has been accelerated by the development of advanced deep learning-based data processing technologies. Moreover, large automakers manufacture vehicles that can achieve partially or fully autonomous driving for driving on real roads. However, self-driving cars are limited to some areas with multi-lane roads, such as highways, and self-driving cars that drive in urban areas or residential complexes are still in the development stage. Among autonomous vehicles for various purposes, this paper focused on the development of autonomous vehicles for garbage collection in residential areas. Since we set the target environment of the vehicle as a residential complex, there is a difference from the target environment of a general autonomous vehicle. Therefore, in this paper, we defined ODD, including vehicle length, speed, and driving conditions for the development vehicle to drive in a residential area. In addition, to recognize the vehicle's surroundings and respond to various situations, it is equipped with various sensors and additional devices that can notify the outside of the vehicle's state or operate it in an emergency. In addition, an autonomous driving system capable of object recognition, lane recognition, route planning, vehicle manipulation, and abnormal situation detection was configured to suit the vehicle hardware and driving environment configured in this way. Finally, by performing autonomous driving in the actual experimental section with the developed vehicle, it was confirmed that the function of autonomous driving in the residential area works appropriately. Moreover, we confirmed that this vehicle would support garbage collection works through the experiment of work efficiency.

AB Autonomous vehicles have the potential to improve automotive safety, largely by removing human error as a possible cause of collisions. However, it cannot be guaranteed that autonomous vehicles will be able to eliminate all collisions. Therefore, automotive safety will continue to be a necessity for automotive design. This paper proposes a decision making system which selects the least severe collision for an autonomous vehicle to take, when facing multiple imminent and unavoidable collisions on a motorway. The novel decision making system developed combines simulation results and multi-attribute decision making (MADM) methods. The simulator includes models of vehicle dynamics and the manoeuvre trajectory path. MADM methods are used to decide which vehicle(s) the autonomous vehicle should collide with, based on the severity of collisions. Severity of collisions is calculated in the simulator using the following variables: impact velocity between autonomous vehicle and vehicle ahead, impact velocity between vehicle behind and autonomous vehicle, manoeuvre acceleration and time-to-collision. Various MADM methods are investigated and three methods are selected including the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), and the Analytical Network Process (ANP). Various collision scenarios are defined and tested in order to understand the impact that small changes in parameters of the autonomous vehicle and vehicles ahead and behind have on the decision made. The analysed decision making results are promising and lead to the conclusion that MADM methods can be successfully applied in autonomous vehicles.

AB The increasing requirements for vehicle driving safety improvement have led to numerous and in-depth studies on vehicle stability, especially for autonomous vehicles. The main concerns of vehicle stability research in autonomous vehicles include the vehicle stability analyzing, criterion constructing and controller designing. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art vehicle stability criterion and control application for autonomous vehicles. First, the lateral vehicle linear stability criterion and widely-used active stability control applications are introduced. Next, the nonlinear vehicle stability analysis algorithm and criterion, based on the well-known phase plane method, are discussed in detail. The stability controller design, including the activation strategy and tracking objectives, is reviewed. In addition, emerging research challenges and trends for future improvement in lateral stabilization of autonomous vehicles are finally summarized.

AB In recent years, technological advancements have made a promising impact on the development of autonomous vehicles. The evolution of electric vehicles, development of state-of-the-art sensors, and advances in artificial intelligence have provided necessary tools for the academia and industry to develop the prototypes of autonomous vehicles that enhance the road safety and traffic efficiency. The increase in the deployment of sensors for the autonomous vehicle, make it less cost-effective to be utilized by the consumer. This work focuses on the development of full-stack autonomous vehicle using the limited amount of sensors suite. The architecture aspect of the autonomous vehicle is categorized into four layers that include sensor layer, perception layer, planning layer and control layer. In the sensor layer, the integration of exteroceptive and proprioceptive sensors on the autonomous vehicle are presented. The perception of the environment in term localization and detection using exteroceptive sensors are included in the perception layer. In the planning layer, algorithms for mission and motion planning are illustrated by incorporating the route information, velocity replanning and obstacle avoidance. The control layer constitutes lateral and longitudinal control for the autonomous vehicle. For the verification of the proposed system, the autonomous vehicle is tested in an unconstrained environment. The experimentation results show the efficacy of each module, including localization, object detection, mission and motion planning, obstacle avoidance, velocity replanning, lateral and longitudinal control. Further, in order to demonstrate the experimental validation and the application aspect of the autonomous vehicle, the proposed system is tested as an autonomous taxi service.

AB The development of light detection and ranging, Radar, camera, and other advanced sensor technologies inaugurated a new era in autonomous driving. However, due to the intrinsic limitations of these sensors, autonomous vehicles are prone to making erroneous decisions and causing serious disasters. At this point, networking and communication technologies can greatly make up for sensor deficiencies, and are more reliable, feasible and efficient to promote the information interaction, thereby improving autonomous vehicle's perception and planning capabilities as well as realizing better vehicle control. This paper surveys the networking and communication technologies in autonomous driving from two aspects: intra- and inter-vehicle. The intra-vehicle network as the basis of realizing autonomous driving connects the on-hoard electronic parts. The inter-vehicle network is the medium for interaction between vehicles and outside information. In addition, we present the new trends of communication technologies in autonomous driving, as well as investigate the current mainstream verification methods and emphasize the challenges and open issues of networking and communications in autonomous driving.

AB In order to explore the changes that autonomous vehicles would bring to the current traffic system, we analyze the car-following behavior of different traffic scenarios based on an anti-collision theory and establish a traffic flow model with an arbitrary proportion (p) of autonomous vehicles. Using calculus and difference methods, a speed transformation model is established which could make the autonomous/human-driven vehicles maintain synchronized speed changes. Based on multi-hydrodynamic theory, a mixed traffic flow model capable of numerical calculation is established to predict the changes in traffic flow under different proportions of autonomous vehicles, then obtain the redistribution characteristics of traffic flow. Results show that the reaction time of autonomous vehicles has a decisive influence on traffic capacity; the q-k curve for mixed human/autonomous traffic remains in the region between the q-k curves for 100% human and 100% autonomous traffic; the participation of autonomous vehicles won't bring essential changes to road traffic parameters; the speed-following transformation model minimizes the safety distance and provides a reference for the bottom program design of autonomous vehicles. In general, the research could not only optimize the stability of transportation system operation but also save road resources.

   security survey
AB As technology has evolved, cities have become increasingly smart. Smart mobility is a crucial element in smart cities, and autonomous vehicles are an essential part of smart mobility. However, vulnerabilities in autonomous vehicles can be damaging to quality of life and human safety. For this reason, many security researchers have studied attacks and defenses for autonomous vehicles. However, there has not been systematic research on attacks and defenses for autonomous vehicles. In this survey, we analyzed previously conducted attack and defense studies described in 151 papers from 2008 to 2019 for a systematic and comprehensive investigation of autonomous vehicles. We classified autonomous attacks into the three categories of autonomous control system, autonomous driving systems components, and vehicle-to-everything communications. Defense against such attacks was classified into security architecture, intrusion detection, and anomaly detection. Due to the development of big data and communication technologies, techniques for detecting abnormalities using artificial intelligence and machine learning are gradually being developed. Lastly, we provide implications based on our systemic survey that future research on autonomous attacks and defenses is strongly combined with artificial intelligence and major component of smart cities.

AB Autonomous vehicles have been envisioned to increase vehicle safety, primarily via the reduction of accidents. However, their design could also affect the vehicle travel demand and energy consumption. Although battery-powered electric and hybrid-electric autonomous vehicles assume more widespread use than conventional autonomous vehicles, energy management is harder and more significant for conventional autonomous vehicles. As such, it is necessary to investigate how to manage energy consumption in conventional autonomous vehicles. In this paper, an energy management system is constructed and analyzed by using a road-power-demand model and an intelligent system to reduce fuel consumption for a conventional autonomous vehicle. The road-power-demand model utilizes three impact factors (i) environment-conditions (ii) driver-behavior, and (iii) vehicle-specifications. The proposed intelligent energy management system includes a fuzzy-logic-system with the aim of generating the desired engine torque, based on the vehicle road power demand and a PID controller to control the air/fuel ratio, by changing the throttle angle. Results show that the intelligent energy management system reduces the vehicle energy consumption from 7.2 to 6.71 L/100 km. Next, the parameters of the fuzzy-logic-system are intelligently optimized by the particle-swarm-optimization method and new results indicate that the vehicle energy consumption is reduced by around 9.58%.

AB The growing relevance of sustainability, as well as the necessity to replace traditional forms of transportation with sustainable ones, has made sustainable urban mobility an imperative. In order to respond to the ever-increasing need to develop sustainable modes of transport, the importance of electric, autonomous, and electric autonomous vehicles is increasingly emphasized. In addition, as trends of growth and development in electric autonomous vehicle technology are increasing, one of the questions that has appeared is whether autonomous electric vehicles represent one of the mechanisms that will be used to increase the sustainability of urban mobility. With this in mind, the results of a systematic analysis of existing research in the WOS and Scopus databases using the keywords "urban mobility", "electric vehicles", and "autonomous vehicles" was carried out to identify research trends in the use of autonomous electric vehicles in urban areas. The research showed that authors focus on the advantages and disadvantages of autonomous electric vehicles and their usage in the urban mobility system, but an insufficient number of authors consider and define the need to plan the transition towards incorporating autonomous electric vehicles into the urban system. The results of this research also indicate an insufficient number of papers that research and describe the application of autonomous electric vehicles in distribution logistics. This paper provides an overview of existing research related to autonomous electric vehicles and the challenges of transition in the context of infrastructure and the development of a culture of sustainability among urban residents.

TI Erasing Lane Changes From Roads: A Design of Future Road Intersections

AB Imagine in the future that autonomous vehicles coordinated and guided by signal-free autonomous intersections are able to pass through the intersections immediately after the vehicles in the conflicting direction leave. Meanwhile, with the coordination of the autonomous intersections, autonomous vehicles on any approaching lane are able to turn onto any downstream lane, expecting that driving in such a road system, autonomous vehicles can reach their destinations without any on-road lane changes, and high traffic efficiency will be achieved as well as great traffic safety. To draw the picture in detail, this paper designs a signal-free autonomous intersection with all-direction turn lanes (ADTL) under the environment of autonomous vehicles, and proposes a conflict-avoidance-based approach to coordinate all approaching vehicles in different directions. Communicating with the approaching autonomous vehicles and utilizing the approach, the autonomous ADTL intersection is able to coordinate the approaching vehicles in all directions and guide them to safely and efficiently pass through the intersection. Two simulation scenarios are conducted in a road network with an isolated intersection composed of four three-lane arms. One scenario validates the collision-free design of the system, and the other shows that the designed ADTL intersection outperforms the conventional signal controlled intersection in terms of traffic efficiency, and is potentially better than the autonomous intersection with specific-direction turn lanes. The autonomous ADTL intersection can be an important basis for designing a future autonomous urban road traffic system.

AB This article presents the three-dimensional leader-follower formation control strategy of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles on the basis of line-of-sight measurement. Sensors on autonomous underwater vehicles can measure line-of-sight range and bearing information, and autonomous underwater vehicles in formation do not require mutual exchange with one another, which could avoid the problem of data transmission delay. The proposed Lyapunov-based backstepping approach is developed for the formation controller. The backstepping controller propels the follower autonomous underwater vehicles to follow the desired virtual reference route provided according to the range and bearing information of the leader autonomous underwater vehicle and the predetermined formation. Simulation results indicate that follower autonomous underwater vehicles can travel along the desired route and successfully achieve the designed formation shape. The effectiveness of the employed method is validated.

AB Autonomous vehicles are on the horizon and will be transforming transportation safety and comfort. These vehicles will be connected to various external systems and utilize advanced embedded systems to perceive their environment and make intelligent decisions. However, this increased connectivity makes these vehicles vulnerable to various cyber-attacks that can have catastrophic effects. Attacks on automotive systems are already on the rise in today's vehicles and are expected to become more commonplace in future autonomous vehicles. Thus, there is a need to strengthen cybersecurity in future autonomous vehicles. In this article, we discuss major automotive cyber-attacks over the past decade and present state-of-the-art solutions that leverage artificial intelligence. We propose a roadmap toward building secure autonomous vehicles and highlight key open challenges that need to be addressed.

AB Based on analytical and simulation methods, this paper discusses the path choice behavior of mixed traffic flow with autonomous vehicles, advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) vehicles and ordinary vehicles, aiming to promote the development of autonomous vehicles. Firstly, a bi-level programming model of mixed traffic flow assignments constrained by link capacity is established to minimize travel time. Subsequently, the algorithm based on the incremental allocation method and method of successive averages is proposed to solve the model. Through a numerical example, the road network capacity under different modes is obtained, the impact of market penetration on travel time is analyzed, and the state and characteristics of single equilibrium flow and mixed equilibrium flow are explored. Analysis results show that the road network can be maximized based on saving travel time when all vehicles are autonomous, especially when the autonomous lane is adopted. The travel time can be shortened by increasing the market penetration of autonomous vehicles and ATIS vehicles, while the former is more effective. However, the popularization of autonomous vehicles cannot be realized in the short term; the market penetration of autonomous vehicles and ATIS vehicles can be set to 0.2 and 0.6, respectively, during the introduction period.

AB Autonomous vehicles must be comprehensively evaluated before deployed in cities and highways. However, most existing evaluation approaches for autonomous vehicles are static and lack adaptability, so they are usually inefficient in generating challenging scenarios for tested vehicles. In this paper, we propose an adaptive evaluation framework to efficiently evaluate autonomous vehicles in adversarial environments generated by deep reinforcement learning. Considering the multimodal nature of dangerous scenarios, we use ensemble models to represent different local optimums for diversity. We then utilize a nonparametric Bayesian method to cluster the adversarial policies. The proposed method is validated in a typical lane-change scenario that involves frequent interactions between the ego vehicle and the surrounding vehicles. Results show that the adversarial scenarios generated by our method significantly degrade the performance of the tested vehicles. We also illustrate different patterns of generated adversarial environments, which can be used to infer the weaknesses of the tested vehicles.

AB The safe human-level decision-making for expressing the autonomous vehicles and the estimation of the eco vehicles has been proposed for the motion control for the driving behavior. For efficient decision-making, the sensor-based tracking of the autonomous machine for blockchain is to be done. The sensor-based history recording management has to propose, and storing the vehicle's traveling history must be managed. For security reasons, the blockchain is done. Self-determination theory and energy-efficient mixed-precision neural networks are used in autonomous vehicles' decision-making, and this technique is used in making moral decisions. The self-determination theory is used in creating the vehicles traveling steps using the innovative signal delivery system of the autonomous vehicles. The energy-efficient mixed-precision neural networks are used in managing the problem that travels the signal to the vehicles using the mixed-precision neural networks. The vehicle network has been made more efficient for storing the data of the mixed precision value and its neural network from autonomous vehicles. Here 80% of the precision value is raised compared to the previous days. In previous days, 20% of the precision has been calculated in autonomous vehicles. Comparing this, 60% of the precision value has been raised in traveling history. According to these variations, 40%-50% of autonomous vehicles' data transmission that delivers the neural network has been proposed. By improving autonomous vehicles, the efficiency of mixed precision neural networks is the decision-making for efficient precision.

AB Car-following is an essential trajectory control strategy for the autonomous vehicle, which not only improves traffic efficiency, but also reduces fuel consumption and emissions. However, the prediction of lane change intentions in adjacent lanes is problematic, and will significantly affect the car-following control of the autonomous vehicle, especially when the vehicle changing lanes is only a connected unintelligent vehicle without expensive and accurate sensors. Autonomous vehicles suffer from adjacent vehicles' abrupt lane changes, which may reduce ride comfort and increase energy consumption, and even lead to a collision. A machine learning-based lane change intention prediction and real time autonomous vehicle controller is proposed to respond to this problem. First, an interval-based support vector machine is designed to predict the vehicles' lane change intention utilizing limited low-level vehicle status through vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Then, a conditional artificial potential field method is used to design the car-following controller by incorporating the lane-change intentions of the vehicle. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method can estimate a vehicle's lane change intention more accurately. The autonomous vehicle avoids collisions with a lane-changing connected unintelligent vehicle with reliable safety and favorable dynamic performance.

AB This paper presents a probabilistic trajectory prediction of cut-in vehicles exploiting the information of interacting vehicles. First, a probability distribution of behavioral parameters, which represents the characteristics of lane-change motion, is obtained via Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). For this purpose, Gaussian Process (GP) models are trained using real-world trajectories of lane-changing vehicles and adjacent vehicles. Subsequently, the future states of the lane-change vehicle are probabilistically estimated using a path-following model, which introduces virtual measurements based on the information of behavioral parameters. The proposed predictor is applied to the motion planning and control of autonomous vehicles. A Model Predictive Control (MPC) is designed to achieve predictive maneuvering of autonomous vehicles against cut-in preceding vehicles. The proposed predictor has been evaluated in terms of its prediction accuracy. Also, the performance of the proposed predictor-based control has been validated via computer simulations and autonomous driving vehicle tests. Compared to conventional prediction methods, it is shown that the interaction-aware proposed predictor provides improved prediction of cut-in vehicles' motion in multi-vehicle scenarios. Furthermore, the control results indicate that the proposed predictor helps the autonomous vehicle to reduce the control effort and improve ride quality for passengers in cut-in scenarios, while guaranteeing safety.

AB Autonomous vehicles are expected to be commercialized within a few years, and researchers have investigated various factors that influence their adoption. However, only a few studies have considered comparative and psychological perspectives that can affect user-vehicle relationships. Focusing on this limitation, this study investigates influential factors on the use of autonomous vehicles in terms of a technology acceptance model (which considers perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and intention to use) and factors for autonomous vehicle use (e.g., perceived risk, relative advantage, self-efficacy, and psychological ownership (i.e., feeling of ownership)). Our results show that self-efficacy positively affects the perceived ease of use and intention to use, while the relative advantage affects perceived usefulness. Psychological ownership affects the intention to use but not the perceived usefulness. This implies that encouraging a consumer to form a psychological bond (i.e., psychological ownership) with an autonomous vehicle may be an effective strategy for promoting the use of autonomous vehicles.

AB This paper proposes that autonomous vehicles should be designed to reduce light pollution. In support of this specific proposal, a moral assessment of autonomous vehicles more comprehensive than the dilemmatic life-and-death questions of trolley problem-style situations is presented. The paper therefore consists of two interrelated arguments. The first is that autonomous vehicles are currently still a technology in development, and not one that has acquired its definitive shape, meaning the design of both the vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure is open-ended. Design for values is utilized to articulate a path forward, by which engineering ethics should strive to incorporate values into a technology during its development phase. Second, it is argued that nighttime lighting-a critical supporting infrastructure-should be a prima facie consideration for autonomous vehicles during their development phase. It is shown that a reduction in light pollution, and more boldly a better balance of lighting and darkness, can be achieved via the design of future autonomous vehicles. Two case studies are examined (parking lots and highways) through which autonomous vehicles may be designed for "driving in the dark." Nighttime lighting issues are thus inserted into a broader ethics of autonomous vehicles, while simultaneously introducing questions of autonomous vehicles into debates about light pollution.

AB Autonomous vehicles are one of the most highly anticipated technological developments of our time, with potentially wide-ranging social implications. Where dominant popular discourses around autonomous vehicles have tended to espouse a crude form of technological determinism, social scientific engagements with autonomous vehicles have tended to focus on rather narrow utilitarian dimensions related to regulation, safety or efficiency. This article argues that what is therefore largely missing from current debates is a sensitivity to the broader social implications of autonomous vehicles. The article aims to remedy this absence. Through a speculative mode, it is shown how a mobilities approach provides an ideal conceptual lens through which the broader social impacts of autonomous vehicles might be identified and evaluated. The argument is organized across four dimensions: transformations to experiences, inequalities, labour and systems. The article develops an agenda for critical sociological work on automated vehicles; and it calls on sociologists to contribute much-needed critical voices to the institutional and public debates on the development of autonomous vehicles.

AB Several transport policies reduce pollution levels caused by private vehicles by introducing autonomous or electric vehicles and encouraging mode shift from private to public transport through park and ride (P&R) facilities. However, combining the policies of introducing autonomous vehicles with the implementation of electric vehicles and using the P&R system could amplify the decrease of transport sector emissions. The COPERT software has been used to calculate the emissions. This article aims to study these policies and determine which combinations can better reduce pollution. The result shows that each combination of autonomous vehicles reduces pollution to different degrees. In conclusion, the shift to more sustainable transport modes through autonomous electric vehicles and P&R systems reduces pollution in the urban environment to a higher percentage. In contrast, the combination of autonomous vehicles has lower emission reduction but is easier to implement with the currently available infrastructure.

ID EXTRACTION
AB For autonomous driving, a control system that supports precise road maps is required to monitor the operation status of autonomous vehicles in the research stage. Such a system is also required for research related to automobile engineering, sensors, and artificial intelligence. The design of Google Maps and other map services is limited to the provision of map support at 20 levels of high-resolution precision. An ideal map should include information on roads, autonomous vehicles, and Internet of Things (IOT) facilities that support autonomous driving. The aim of this study was to design a map suitable for the control of autonomous vehicles in Gyeonggi Province in Korea. This work was part of the project "Building a Testbed for Pilot Operations of Autonomous Vehicles". The map design scheme was redesigned for an autonomous vehicle control system based on the "Easy Map" developed by the National Geography Center, which provides free design schema. In addition, a vector-based precision map, including roads, sidewalks, and road markings, was produced to provide content suitable for 20 levels. A hybrid map that combines the vector layer of the road and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) orthographic map was designed to facilitate vehicle identification. A control system that can display vehicle and sensor information based on the designed map was developed, and an environment to monitor the operation of autonomous vehicles was established. Finally, the high-precision map was verified through an accuracy test and driving data from autonomous vehicles.

AB Emerging transportation technologies have the potential to significantly reshape the transportation systems and household vehicle ownership. Key among these transportation technologies are the autonomous vehicles, particularly when introduced in shared vehicle fleets. In this paper, we focus on the potential impact that fleets of shared autonomous vehicles might have on household vehicle ownership. To obtain initial insights into this issue, we asked a sample of university personnel and members of the American Automobile Association as to how likely they would consider relinquishing one of their household's personal vehicles if shared autonomous vehicles were available (thus reducing their household vehicle ownership level by one). For single-vehicle households, this would be relinquishing their only vehicle, and for multivehicle households (households owning two or more vehicles) this would be relinquishing just one of their vehicles. Possible responses to the question about relinquishing a household vehicle if shared autonomous vehicles are present are: extremely unlikely, unlikely, unsure, likely, and extremely likely. To determine the factors that influence this response, random parameters ordered probit models are estimated to account for the likelihood that considerable unobserved heterogeneity is likely to be present in the data. The findings show that a wide range of socioeconomic factors affects people's likelihood of vehicle relinquishment in the presence of shared autonomous vehicles. Key among these are gender effects, generational elements, commuting patterns, and respondents' vehicle crash history and experiences. While people's opinions of shared autonomous vehicles are evolving with the continual introduction of new autonomous vehicle technologies and shifting travel behavior, the results of this study provide important initial insights into the likely effects of shared autonomous vehicles on household vehicle ownership.

AB The actions of autonomous vehicle manufacturers and related industrial partners, as well as the interest from policy makers and researchers, point towards the likely initial deployment of autonomous vehicles as shared autonomous mobility services. Numerous studies are lately being published regarding Shared Autonomous Vehicle (SAV) applications and hence, it is imperative to have a comprehensive outlook, consolidating the existing knowledge base. This work comprehensively consolidates studies in the rapidly emerging field of SAV. The primary focus is the comprehensive review of the foreseen impacts, which are categorised into seven groups, namely (i) Traffic & Safety, (ii) Travel behaviour, (iii) Economy, (iv) Transport supply, (v) Land use, (vi) Environment & (vii) Governance. Pertinently, an SAV typology is presented and the components involved in modelling SAV services are described. Issues relating to the expected demand patterns and a required suitable policy framework are explicitly discussed.

AB This paper proposes models and algorithms for the estimation of traffic flows generated by the centralised management of autonomous vehicles under exclusive and mixed traffic conditions. It is assumed that the autonomous vehicle manager wants to obtain the system optimum that minimises the total travel time on the network, of autonomous vehicles in the case of exclusive traffic, and of all flows in the case of mixed traffic. In the case of mixed traffic, the drivers of the human-guided vehicles choose their routes from a user-optimal perspective; in this case, a fixedpoint problem has to be solved, which represents a state of equilibrium between the flows of human-guided vehicles, the flows of autonomous vehicles, which follow paths aimed at the system optimum, and the link costs. The proposed models and algorithms are tested on a small network with a single origin-destination pair, and on the Sioux Falls network, with different levels of congestion and different percentages of autonomous vehicles. The results show the validity of the proposed methods and the impact of autonomous vehicles on network performance. The proposed static/equilibrium approach is necessary to evaluate transport planning, design or policy interventions that include the presence of autonomous vehicles in traffic flows.

AB Autonomous driving of multi-lane vehicle platoons have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their potential to enhance the traffic-carrying capacity of the roads and produce better safety for drivers and passengers. This paper proposes a distributed motion planning algorithm to ensure safe overtaking of autonomous vehicles in a dynamic environment using the Artificial Potential Field method. Unlike the conventional overtaking techniques, autonomous driving strategies can be used to implement safe overtaking via formation control of unmanned vehicles in a complex vehicle platoon in the presence of human-operated vehicles. Firstly, we formulate the overtaking problem of a group of autonomous vehicles into a multi-target tracking problem, where the targets are dynamic. To model a multi-vehicle system consisting of both autonomous and human-operated vehicles, we introduce the notion of velocity difference potential field and acceleration difference potential field. We then analyze the stability of the multi-lane vehicle platoon and propose an optimization-based algorithm for solving the overtaking problem by placing a dynamic target in the traditional artificial potential field. A simulation case study has been performed to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed distributed motion control strategy for safe overtaking in a multi-lane vehicle platoon.

AB Currently, the autonomous driving technique is attracting increasing research focus from all over the world. Generally, the control systems of an autonomous vehicle include environment perception, path planning and path tracking control systems. In this paper, the path tracking control issue of the autonomous vehicle will be focused on. Few of the previous proposed path tracking controllers consider the vehicle driving and handling limit, which degenerates the potential of the autonomous vehicle to finish the desired path as quick as possible. To this end, this paper proposes a path tracking controller for autonomous vehicle, which aims at pushing it to the driving and handling limit. The limit dynamic performance of the autonomous vehicle is represented by the G-G diagram, which indicates the acceleration capability of the autonomous vehicle. The G-G diagram is obtained by phase portrait method and it is validated by a modified FSAE racing car. Finally, a path tracking controller based on the G-G diagram is proposed. The simulation validation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

AB Many nations' transportation strategies have highlighted the potential of autonomous vehicles and have made plans to slowly phase them into societies over the next decade. Consequently, public acceptance of autonomous vehicles is crucial, and this study will be applying the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) and Computers as Social Actors as the theoretical backbone. Five hundred valid survey responses from people residing in Singapore were collected and structural equation modeling was utilized to confirm the theoretical model. From the results, all of the identified constructs from UTAUT2 and Computer as Social Actors are significant. The performance expectancy of autonomous vehicles and interaction quality of the intelligent in-vehicle interaction technology also mediate public acceptance of autonomous vehicles. Moreover, among the constructs, interaction quality, social influence, and performance expectancy have the greatest total effect on the acceptance of autonomous vehicles. Accordingly, regular feedback sessions must be conducted to ensure consumer-centric improvements in interaction quality and performance expectancy of autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, test drives and collaborative educational campaigns can be organized to generate positive word of mouth about the vehicles among the public.

AB This paper presents a trajectory planning and control algorithm of autonomous vehicles for static traffic agent avoidance in multi vehicle urban environments. In urban autonomous driving, the subject vehicle encounters diverse traffic scenes including lane changing, intersection driving, and illegally parked static vehicle avoidance. Among these, dealing with illegally parked static target vehicle is a major challenge to urban autonomous driving due to large velocity difference between ego and target vehicles and interactions with surrounding vehicles. In order to tackle this problem, we introduce a decision making and motion planning framework for static vehicle avoidance considering both the preceding static vehicles and surrounding vehicles. Among the surrounding vehicles, the set of objects with potential collision risk is selected based on the lane boundaries and road geometry. Then, the driving status of the selected target vehicles are classified as normal driving vehicles or parked vehicles based on their longitudinal speed, lateral position and lateral space occupancy. For the preceding parked vehicles, the motion planner generates lateral and longitudinal evasive motion, by taking side lane traffic flow and risk into account. The desired motion is executed by applying optimized control inputs computed by lateral and longitudinal model predictive controllers. The performance validation of the proposed algorithm has been conducted with actual autonomous test vehicles. The test results confirmed that the proposed algorithm can successfully perform evasive maneuvers on urban roads to ensure safety and mitigate collision risk with the surrounding traffic agents.

AB Traffic congestion has become increasingly prevalent in many urban areas, and researchers are continuously looking into new ways to resolve this pertinent issue. Autonomous vehicles are one of the technologies expected to revolutionize transportation systems. To this very day, there are limited studies focused on the impact of autonomous vehicles in heterogeneous traffic flow in terms of different driving modes (manual and self-driving). Autonomous vehicles in the near future will be running parallel with manual vehicles, and drivers will have different characteristics and attributes. Previous studies that have focused on the impact of autonomous vehicles in these conditions are scarce. This paper proposes a new cellular automata model to address this issue, where different autonomous vehicles (cars and buses) and manual vehicles (cars and buses) are compared in terms of fundamental traffic parameters. Manual cars are further divided into subcategories on the basis of age groups and gender. Each category has its own distinct attributes, which make it different from the others. This is done in order to obtain a simulation as close as possible to a real-world scenario. Furthermore, different lane-changing behavior patterns have been modeled for autonomous and manual vehicles. Subsequently, different scenarios with different compositions are simulated to investigate the impact of autonomous vehicles on traffic flow in heterogeneous conditions. The results suggest that autonomous vehicles can raise the flow rate of any network considerably despite the running heterogeneous traffic flow.

AB The energy utilization efficiency of autonomous electric vehicles is seriously affected by the longitudinal motion control performance. However, the longitudinal motion control is constrained by the driving scene. This article proposes an energy-saving optimization and control (ESOC) method to improve the energy utilization efficiency of autonomous electric vehicles. In ESOC, the constraints from the driving scene are thoroughly considered, and the autonomous driving scene constraints are mapped to the vehicle dynamics and control domain. On this basis, the efficiency self-searching method and the multiconstraint energy-saving control strategy are designed. The main ideology of the proposed ESOC is that the energy utilization efficiency of an autonomous electric vehicle can be improved by optimizing and controlling the operation point distribution of the powertrain efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate that the operation point distribution of the autonomous electric vehicle's powertrain efficiency can be well optimized by the proposed ESOC, and the energy consumption results indicate that the proposed ESOC outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

AB There is rapidly growing interest in autonomous electric vehicles due to their potential in improving safety, accessibility, and environmental outcomes. However, their market penetration rate is dependent on costs. Use of autonomous electric vehicles for shared-use mobility may improve their cost competitiveness. So far, most of the research has focused on the cost impact of autonomy on taxis and ridesourcing services. Singapore is planning for island-wide deployment of autonomous vehicles for both scheduled and on-demand services as part of their transit system in the year 2030. TUMCREATE developed an autonomous electric vehicle concept, a microtransit vehicle with 30-passenger capacity, which can complement the existing bus transit system. This study aims to determine the cost of autonomous electric microtransit vehicles and compare them to those of buses. A total cost of ownership (TCO) approach was used to compare the lifecycle costs. It was shown that although the acquisition costs of autonomous electric vehicles are higher than those of their conventional counterparts, they can reduce the TCO per passenger-km up to 75% and 60% compared to their conventional counterparts and buses, respectively.

AB Autonomous vehicles are expected to influence daily travel significantly. Despite autonomous vehicles' potential to enhance safety and to reduce congestion, energy consumption, and emissions, many studies suggest that the system-level effects will be minimal at low market penetration rates. Introducing reserved lanes for autonomous vehicles is one potential approach to address this limitation because these lanes increase autonomous vehicles' density. However, preventing regular vehicles from using specific lanes can significantly increase congestion in other lanes. Accordingly, this study explored the potential effects of reserving one lane for autonomous vehicles on traffic flow dynamics and travel time reliability. A two-lane hypothetical segment with an on-ramp and a four-lane highway segment in Chicago, Illinois, was simulated under different market penetration rates of autonomous vehicles. Three strategies were evaluated: (a) mandatory use of the reserved lane by autonomous vehicles, (b) optional use of the reserved lane by autonomous vehicles, and (c) limiting autonomous vehicles to operate autonomously in the reserved lane. Policies based on combinations of these strategies were simulated. It was found that optional use of the reserved lane without any limitation on the type of operation could improve congestion and could reduce the scatter in a fundamental diagram. Throughput analysis showed the potential benefit of reserving a lane for autonomous vehicles at market penetration rates of more than 50% for the two-lane highway and 30% for the four-lane highway. Travel time reliability analysis revealed that the optional use of the reserved lane was also significantly beneficial.

AB Human drivers naturally adapt their behaviour depending on the traffic conditions, such as the current weather and road type. Autonomous vehicles need to do the same, in a way that is both safe and efficient in traffic composed of both conventional and autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we demonstrate the applicability of a reconfigurable vehicle controller agent for autonomous vehicles that adapts the parameters of a used car-following model at runtime, so as to maintain a high degree of traffic quality (efficiency and safety) under different weather conditions. We follow a dynamic software product line approach to model the variability of the car-following model parameters, context changes and traffic quality, and generate specific configurations for each particular context. Under realistic conditions, autonomous vehicles have only a very local knowledge of other vehicles' variables. We investigate a distributed model predictive controller agent for autonomous vehicles to estimate their behavioural parameters at runtime, based on their available knowledge of the system. We show that autonomous vehicles with the proposed reconfigurable controller agent lead to behaviour similar to that achieved by human drivers, depending on the context.

AB A commercially available tracked vehicle was modified to make it capable of autonomous operation in a forest environment. The vehicle, of 1364 kg mass (3000 lbs weight), was powered by a 22 kW (30 hp) diesel engine coupled to a hydraulic drive. For autonomous operation, the vehicle was equipped with shaft encoders on the drive wheels, a magnetic compass, three ultrasonic sensors, and a stereoscopic camera. Autonomous operation was enabled by hierarchical fuzzy logic controllers. Two controllers were considered One controller used shaft encoder counts on the drive wheels, ultrasonic waveform echoes, the magnetic compass for heading, and training data to navigate a forest path. The other controller added stereoscopic vision and dispensed with the training data to reactively navigate the autonomous outdoor vehicle. The vehicle was equipped with GPS, but GPS was only used as an independent measure of vehicle performance in the autonomous mode. Tests using both controllers showed that the autonomous vehicle was able to reliably navigate several forest paths with lengths ranging from 229 to 430 m (750 to 1410 ft) without relying on GPS for navigation. These tests indicate that an industrial-size vehicle may be capable of performing useful forestry functions in an autonomous mode.

AB The impacts of autonomous vehicles, coupled with greater inter-vehicle and system connectivity, may be far-reaching on several levels. They entail changes to (1) the demand and behavior side, (2) the supply of mobility services, and (3) network and facility operational performance. We focus here on their impact on traffic flow and operations, especially in mixed traffic situations in which autonomous vehicles share the road with regular, human-driven vehicles, along with connected vehicles that may also have some automated functions. These mixed traffic situations correspond to likely deployment scenarios of the technologies, especially in the long transition towards 100% deployment. We explain using elementary traffic science concepts how autonomous vehicles and connected vehicles are expected to increase the throughput of highway facilities, as well as improve the stability of the traffic stream. A microsimulation framework featuring varying behavioral mechanisms for the three classes of vehicles is introduced. The framework is used to examine the throughput and stability questions through a series of experiments under varying market penetration rates of autonomous and/or connected vehicles; at low market shares, the impacts are relatively minor on either throughput or stability. However, as market shares increase, autonomous vehicles exert a greater influence on both dimensions compared to the same shares of connected vehicles. Applications of the framework to examine the effectiveness of selected traffic management approaches are discussed, including dedicated lanes for autonomous vehicles (good only if its use is optional and when the market share of autonomous vehicles is greater than the percentage of nominal capacity represented by that lane), and speed harmonization.

AB The emergence of autonomous vehicles will significantly improve traffic efficiency and safety. Before the fully autonomous driving of traffic system, the mixed traffic with autonomous and human-driven vehicles will be a typical feature for the future road traffic. To study the properties of a mixed traffic mode combining autonomous and human-driven vehicles, a cellular automata model based traffic system considering autonomous and human-driven vehicles is proposed. In the mixed traffic model, human-driven vehicles can use multiple preceding vehicles' information within drivers' visual range for vehicle motion. For autonomous vehicles, the interaction mechanism of information is iterative and the communication range for vehicle-to-vehicle is considered. The results from this study show that the average traffic flow can be enhanced with the increase of communication range for autonomous vehicles. But when the communication range is big enough, its role on traffic flow is little. Also, it is found that human-driven vehicles' behavior of obtaining multiple preceding vehicles' information can significantly impact the meta-stable state of traffic flow in the average flow density phase. Further, the relationship between the average flow and vehicle density of the mixed traffic flow with random distribution, uniform distribution and separate distribution is discussed. And it reveals that the traffic capacity of the mixed traffic flow with separate distribution is more impressive comparing to the traffic capacity with random distribution and uniform distribution. Finally, the traffic congestion rate under different values of penetration rate is verified and it uncovers that the congestion rate is reduced with the increase of penetration rate.

AB With the rapid development of autonomous vehicles, it is necessary to explore new business opportunities, especially under the assistance of internet of things, which accelerate the penetration in vehicle markets. Automated valet parking and shared autonomous vehicles will be the most active cases promoted by autonomous driving. In this paper, the business models of automated valet parking and shared autonomous vehicles were proposed, further, the cost structures of autonomous vehicles under two cases were investigated from points of car users and owners. In the business models, autonomous driving packages, internet of things devices, and service provider companies are considered as new stakeholders. The cost structure of automated valet parking users changes greatly, with the development of autonomous driving packages whose cost share decreases from similar to 60% to similar to 5%. The total cost of automated valet parking users is much higher than conventional parking before 2024. Additionally, the use of shared vehicles relieves financial burden, without trouble of periodical maintenance. For station-based and free-floating car sharing, the price drop of autonomous driving package brings about huge benefits for companies. Peer-to-peer car sharing business effectively decreases financial burden of car owners such that the decrease is less than 20% starting from 2017.

AB This study investigates the probability of visibility limitation of autonomous driving system sensors under various road geometry conditions. This limited visibility can be a concern for the safety of the transportation system, while it is believed that the reliable autonomous driving system will improve traffic safety based on the enhanced detection and recognition capability of autonomous vehicle sensors. So, this study is conducted with the assumption that inadequate road geometry specifications can negatively affect the reliability of the sensor performance and ultimately increase autonomous vehicle crash risks. First, the study analyzes the forward detection range of an autonomous vehicle's light detection system and radar sensors, which are affected by road curvature and slope. Second, the forward detection range of an AV is analyzed according to the actual road geometry data of expressways, national highways, and urban roads. The findings of this study emphasizes that even though autonomous vehicle manufacturers claim that their vehicles are equipped with specific automation levels allowing these vehicles to be safely driven on a particular road category, there are certain road sections that will be difficult for autonomous vehicles to traverse because of poor road geometry. Furthermore, by estimating forward detection range relative to actual road geometry data, it is demonstrated that the performance requirement level of autonomous driving systems increases when road geometries are less complex.

AB Autonomous vehicles offer the opportunity of significant benefits to social life, such as improving safety, reducing crashes, decreasing fuel consumption and so on. This study presents a novel adaptive dynamic surface longitudinal tracking control strategy for autonomous vehicles to deal with the effects of non-linearities and parametric uncertainties of vehicles. First, a longitudinal vehicle model, which can describe the features of non-linear and external disturbances of autonomous vehicles, is established. Then, an adaptive dynamic surface longitudinal control system is proposed to avoid the explosion of complexity. In addition, an adaptive estimated approach based on neural networks technique is designed to approximate the model uncertainties of autonomous vehicles. The stability of the proposed adaptive control system is discussed by the Lyapunov theory. It has been illustrated for both simulation and experimental tests that the proposed adaptive control system has a remarkable longitudinal tracking performance of the autonomous vehicle.

AB Forming a stable autonomous vehicle group is extremely challenging in an urban scene, which is disturbed by many environmental factors, e.g., manned vehicles, roadside obstacles, traffic lights, and pedestrians. Existing work focuses on autonomous vehicle group formation (AVGF) in a highway scene only. Its outcomes cannot be directly applied to an urban scene because of different environmental factors and poor communication quality. This work presents an autonomous vehicle group model in an urban scene. First, it proposes a prediction method to analyze the impact of environmental factors on communications among autonomous vehicles. Then, it defines preperception degree, vehicle activity, and mobility similarity of autonomous vehicles and selects leader vehicles based on them. Next, it measures connectivity, coupling, and timeliness increments of a vehicle group, based on which a vehicle group model is formulated. Finally, it solves the proposed vehicle group model by using a modified distributed multiobjective optimization method, proves its convergence, and analyzes its time complexity. The simulation results on synthetic and real roads show that the proposed prediction method achieves lower errors than XGBoost and a multilayer perceptron, and the proposed vehicle group model outperforms two AVGF methods and a dynamic clustering method for vehicular ad-hoc network.

AB Nowadays, the concept of new mobility solutions like shared mobility systems is becoming more and more popular in current transport systems. The next technological step will be the idea of replacing traditional vehicles with autonomous ones. Because autonomous vehicles are a new concept in the automotive market, we dedicated this article to the idea of using autonomous vehicles as a part of car-sharing systems in intelligent, urban transport systems. The research herein is focused on the economic aspects of using autonomous vehicles in comparison to the classic car fleet available in car-sharing systems and to vehicles that belong to individual owners. We present our method for appropriate fleet selection based on the Delphi method and the calculations made through a scientific experiment performed based on Hartley's plan. The results indicate the relation of travel parameters (including vehicle type) to the total cost of travel in urban transport systems. We also present the main terms related to autonomous vehicles. This article provides support for people who want to deepen knowledge about autonomous vehicles and new mobility solutions used in urban transport systems.

AB This article presents a navigation method for an autonomous underwater vehicle being recovered by a human-occupied vehicle. The autonomous underwater vehicle is considered to carry underwater navigation sensors such as ultra-short baseline, Doppler velocity log, and inertial navigation system. Using these sensors' information, a navigation module combining the ultra-short baseline positioning and inertial positioning is established. In this study, there is assumed to be no communication between the autonomous underwater vehicle and human-occupied vehicle; thus, to obtain the autonomous underwater vehicle position in the inertial coordinate, a conjecture method to obtain the human-occupied vehicle coordinates is proposed. To reduce the error accumulation of autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, a method called one-step dead reckoning positioning is proposed, and the one-step dead reckoning positioning is treated as a correction to combine with ultra-short baseline positioning by a data fusion algorithm. One-step dead reckoning positioning is a positioning method based on the previous time-step coordinates of the autonomous underwater vehicle.

AB This article develops autonomous-driving vehicle control with a composite velocity profile (CVP) planning. An innovative technique of path planning is presented in the vehicle coordinates to allow complete lane change from any position at the origin lane to the center of the target lane. A technique of control is also presented to allow lane-change control design with vehicle speed planning. The CVP consists of longitudinal and lateral velocity profiles in time and planar geometric domains in the vehicle coordinates, respectively. This article also develops an autonomous-driving control framework with decentralized speed/lateral control using the CVP. The stability of the autonomous-driving control system is mathematically proved. Some experimental results on a test vehicle are also presented to demonstrate the utility of the proposed autonomous-driving vehicle control with CVP planning.

TI Risk Analysis of Autonomous Vehicles in Mixed Traffic Streams
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID PREDICTION; SAFETY
AB The introduction of autonomous vehicles in the surface transportation system could improve traffic safety and reduce traffic congestion and negative environmental effects. Although the continuous evolution in computing, sensing, and communication technologies can improve the performance of autonomous vehicles, the new combination of autonomous automotive and electronic communication technologies will present new challenges, such as interaction with other nonautonomous vehicles, which must be addressed before implementation. The objective of this study was to identify the risks associated with the failure of an autonomous vehicle in mixed traffic streams. To identify the risks, the autonomous vehicle system was first disassembled into vehicular components and transportation infrastructure components, and then a fault tree model was developed for each system. The failure probabilities of each component were estimated by reviewing the published literature and publicly available data sources. This analysis resulted in a failure probability of about 14% resulting from a sequential failure of the autonomous vehicular components alone in the vehicle's lifetime, particularly the components responsible for automation. After the failure probability of autonomous vehicle components was combined with the failure probability of transportation infrastructure components, an overall failure probability related to vehicular or infrastructure components was found: 158 per 1 million mi of travel. The most critical combination of events that could lead to failure of autonomous vehicles, known as minimal cut-sets, was also identified. Finally, the results of fault tree analysis were compared with real-world data available from the California Department of Motor Vehicles autonomous vehicle testing records.

AB Autonomous vehicles are aimed to reduce accidents and traffic congestion. Since hybrid electric vehicles offer feasible solutions to reduce energy consumption and emission to the environment, it is expected that autonomous vehicles will be powered through a hybrid electric system compared to other alternatives. In this paper, a hybrid electric autonomous vehicle is studied under significant amount of uncertainty and ambiguity in the road environment and driver behavior. A Type 1 fuzzy logic controller is constructed here to address the uncertainties of driving conditions. The design involves building an intelligent energy management system for the hybrid electric autonomous vehicle. We have also examined the potentials of the Interval Type 2 fuzzy logic control, especially for energy consumption management. Two simulations are implemented, to demonstrate that the intelligent system, proposed trough Type 1 and Interval Type 2 fuzzy logic control, decreases the fuel usage of the vehicle from 6.74 to 6.58 L/100km, respectively. It is also demonstrated that the Interval Type 2 fuzzy logic controller saves more battery life compared to the Type-1 when the vehicle works under uncertain and ambiguous road conditions. Finally, Interval Type-2 fuzzy logic controller facilitates a reduction of carbon footprint in the autonomous vehicle as desired by the automotive industry stakeholders.

AB This paper presents the development and testing of a neural-network module for autonomous vehicle following. Autonomous vehicle following is defined as a vehicle changing its own steering and speed while following a lead vehicle. The strength of the developed controller is that no characterization of the vehicle dynamics is needed to achieve autonomous operation. As a result, it can be transported to any vehicle regardless of the nonlinear and often unobservable dynamics. Data for the range and heading angle of the lead vehicle were collected for various paths while a human driver performed the vehicle following control function. The data was collected for different driving maneuvers including straight paths, lane changing, and right/left turns. Two time-delay backpropagation neural networks were then trained based on the data collected under manual control-one network for speed control and the other for steering control, After training, live vehicle following runs were done under the neural-network control. The results obtained indicate that it is feasible to employ neural networks to perform autonomous vehicle following.

AB This paper examines the potential impact of autonomous vehicles on commuters' value of travel time (VOTT). In particular, we focus on the effect on auto commuters in small and medium-sized metropolitan areas, concerning the spatial variability across urban areas, suburbs, and rural areas. We design a stated choice experiment to elicit potential changes in 1,881 auto commuters' valuation of travel time in autonomous vehicles and apply a mixed logit model to quantify the changes in the value of travel time if taking autonomous vehicles. The results of this study suggest that the effect of autonomous vehicles on the VOTT is spatially differentiated. We find that riding in a private autonomous vehicle reduces the commuting VOTT of suburban, urban, and rural drivers by 32%, 24%, and 18%, respectively, compared to 14%, 13%, and 8% for riding in a shared autonomous vehicle. Finally, we discuss the implications of these lower values of time on transportation and land use planning.

DE Autonomous land vehicle; path planning algorithm; A-Star algorithm;
   artificial potential field; heuristic function
AB The path planning of autonomous land vehicle has become a research hotspot in recent years. In this article, we present a novel path planning algorithm for an autonomous land vehicle. According to the characteristics of autonomous movement towards the autonomous land vehicle, an improved A-Star path planning algorithm is designed. The disadvantages of using the A-Star algorithm for path planning are that the path planned by the A-Star algorithm contains many unnecessary turning points and is not smooth enough. Autonomous land vehicle needs to adjust its posture at each turning point, which will greatly waste time and also will not be conducive to the motion control of autonomous land vehicle. In view of these shortcomings, this article proposes a new heuristic function combined with the artificial potential field method, which contains both distance information and obstacle information. Our proposed algorithm shows excellent performance in improving the execution efficiency and reducing the number of turning points. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm, compared with the traditional A-Star algorithm, makes the path smoother and makes the autonomous land vehicle easier to control.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB The use of an autonomous surface vehicle as an auxiliary agent to improve connectivity in a network of autonomous underwater vehicles is investigated. An algorithm is developed that consists of an optimal waypoint generator and a minimum-time guidance law that is used to steer the vehicle to the waypoint. This algorithm is used together with a communication architecture to improve underwater vehicle connectivity in a region of interest. The approach is simulated using various underwater vehicle configurations, both with and without the autonomous surface vehicle, where it is found that network connectivity is improved significantly via the inclusion of the autonomous surface vehicle. An in-water hardware test is then performed and is shown to be consistent with the simulation results. The results of this study show that adding an autonomous surface vehicle to an underwater vehicle network can improve the connectivity of the network.

AB Autonomous vehicles will transform urban mobility. However, before being fully implemented, autonomous vehicles will navigate cities in mixed-traffic roads, negotiating traffic with human-driven vehicles. In this work, we simulate a system of autonomous vehicles co-existing with human-driven vehicles, analyzing the consequences of system design choices. The system consists of a network of arterial roads with exclusive lanes for autonomous vehicles where they can travel in platoons. This paper presents the evaluation of this system in realistic scenarios evaluating the impacts of the system on travel time using mesoscopic traffic simulation. We used real data from the metropolis of Sao Paulo to create the simulation scenarios. The results show that the proposed system would bring reductions to the average travel time of the city commuters and other benefits such as the reduction of the space required to handle all the traffic.

AB An autonomous vehicle should be driven at a velocity that allows it to feasibly track a predetermined path. For autonomous vehicles that require high velocity navigation over rough terrain, the driving velocity should be calculated in real time and maximized without exceeding any safety limits. In order to compute the driving velocity in real time, several factors including path curvature, terrain characteristics, vehicle dynamics, and interaction between vehicle and terrain need to be taken into account, along with real time constraints. In this study, a method based on real time traversability analysis is proposed to determine the maximum permissible velocity at which an autonomous vehicle can traverse rough terrain with guaranteed stability. Simulations validated the proposed method for a 6 x 6 autonomous vehicle with articulated suspension traveling over rough terrain.

However, centralized VCS frameworks have confronted many problems, such as privacy, security, utility, and dependability. To remedy these challenges, blockchain technology can be applied in VCS systems for effectively forming decentralized autonomous vehicles organizations and operations. This article briefly introduces blockchain-based VCS solutions addressing the current problems and presents potential directions for future research.

AB We consider a partial differential equation - ordinary differential equation system to describe the dynamics of traffic flow with autonomous vehicles. In the model the bulk flow is represented by a scalar conservation law, while each autonomous vehicle is described by a car following model. The autonomous vehicles act as tracer vehicles in the flow and collect measurements along their trajectories to estimate the bulk flow. The main result is to both prove theoretically and show numerically how to reconstruct the correct traffic density using only the measurements from the autonomous vehicles.

AB As increasingly prevalent technologies in autonomous driving, 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of autonomous vehicle (IoAV) technology is recognized as a technique that is capable of disruptively changing the way people travel and greatly improving the travel experience. In the IoAV scenarios, information dissemination is inseparable from the interaction between autonomous vehicles and smart infrastructure. However, existing efforts rarely focus on the secrecy, authenticity of interactive data and flexible one-to-many communication between autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose a tamper-resistant broadcasting (TRBS) scheme for secure communication, which handles the inefficiencies and insecurity of existing identity-based broadcast signcryption solutions. Not only can our TRBS protect communication data from being illegally accessed, forged, or tampered with by malicious vehicles, but it can also enable efficient and flexible secure information dissemination between autonomous vehicles. We also exhibit strict security proofs and experimental evaluations to demonstrate our TRBS is secure and efficient for real-world applications.

AB This article is concerned with attitudes synchronization of networked autonomous underwater vehicles, which aims to enable all the autonomous underwater vehicles tracking the desired attitude coordinately, when the desired attitude information can only be achieved by one or one subset autonomous underwater vehicles. A Lyapunov technique is presented for designing an adaptive synchronization control protocol using sliding mode and consensus theory. The uncertainty of the autonomous underwater vehicle dynamics, and the unknown external disturbance and input saturation were both considered in our controller proposed; moreover, only the neighbors' information were used by the controller, so it is totally distributed. Simulations were performed to validate the theoretical results.

AB This article proposes a new algorithm for computing solutions to mixed flow problems involving the classical Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) flow model. We show that the behavior of autonomous vehicles can be described by viability constrained solutions to an alternate Hamilton-Jacobi formulation of the same model, for appropriate upper constraint functions. We also provide the physical interpretation of viability constrained solutions to the model. This results in a viability-based framework that can be used to incorporate the effect of autonomous vehicles in traffic, even when these vehicles are allowed to switch between modes (autonomous/non autonomous). We then illustrate this algorithm on realistic traffic simulation examples involving partial switched autonomous vehicle flows.

AB This article aims to introduce a degree of technological and ethical realism to the framing of autonomous vehicle perception and decisionality. The objective is to move the socioethical dialog surrounding autonomous vehicle decisionality from the dominance of "trolley framings" to more pressing ethical issues. The article argues that more realistic ethical framings of autonomous vehicle technologies should focus on the matters of HMI, machine perception, classification, and data privacy, which are some distance from the decisionality framing premise of the MIT Moral Machine experiment. To support this claim the article appeals to state-of-the-art technologies and emerging technologies concerning autonomous vehicle perception and decisionality, as a means to inform and frame ethical contexts. This is further supported by considering a context specific ethical framing for each time phase we anticipate regarding emerging autonomous vehicle technology.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL
AB In real traffic environment, a single control mode of traditional autonomous vehicles cannot meet various driving requirements for different drivers, which will decrease the acceptance of autonomous vehicles, and even may further cause traffic risks. This paper studies the cooperative strategies between ego vehicle and surrounding vehicles with the naturalistic experiment data, and then designs an autonomous vehicle control method based on the distributed Model Predictive Control (MPC) in order to consider the interaction relationship of ego vehicles and surrounding vehicles. Finally, the proposed method is verified by software simulation and Hardware in the Loop (HIL) simulation experiments, and the experiment results demonstrate that the control method proposed in this paper not only can control the vehicle to complete the typical driving tasks smoothly, in terms of car-following and lane-changing, but also can reflect the different cooperative strategies among different driving behavior characteristics, which can improve safety and acceptance of autonomous vehicles to promote the practical application of autonomous vehicle technology.

AB This paper presents a robustH(infinity)fault-tolerant lateral controller of four wheel steering autonomous vehicles to enhance the autonomous driving performance and to track the desired road when a steering wheel fault happens. First, the lateral dynamic model of four wheel steering autonomous vehicles is constructed, which contains the features of parameter uncertainties and actuator faults of vehicles. Then, since the faulty steering wheel may fail to offer the desired torque and harm the lateral motion control system of autonomous vehicles, a novel robustH(infinity)fault tolerant state feedback lateral control law of four steering autonomous vehicles is designed to deal with actuator faults and parameter uncertainties. Finally, simulation tests are implemented in the Adams-Simulink joint platform with a high-fidelity and full-car model, and results verify the validity of this proposed control scheme.

AB Comfort is a significant factor that affects passengers' choice of autonomous vehicles. The comfort of an autonomous vehicle is largely determined by its control algorithm. Therefore, if the comfort of passengers can be predicted based on factors that affect comfort and the control algorithm can be adjusted, it can be beneficial to improve the comfort of autonomous vehicles. In view of this, in the present study, a human-driven experiment was carried out to simulate the typical driving state of a future autonomous vehicle. In the experiment, vehicle motion parameters and the comfort evaluation results of passengers with different physiological characteristics were collected. A single-factor analysis method and binary logistic regression analysis model were used to determine the factors that affect the evaluation results of passenger comfort. A passenger comfort prediction model was established based on the bidirectional long short-term memory network model. The results demonstrate that the accuracy of the passenger comfort prediction model reached 84%, which can provide a theoretical basis for the adjustment of the control algorithm and path trajectory of autonomous vehicles.

AB This study gains insight into individual motivations for choosing to own and use autonomous vehicles and develops a model for autonomous vehicle long-term choice decisions. A stated preference questionnaire is distributed to 721 individuals living across Israel and North America. Based on the characteristics of their current commutes, individuals are presented with various scenarios and asked to choose the car they would use for their commute. A vehicle choice model which includes three options is estimated:
   (1) Continue to commute using a regular car that you have in your possession.
   (2) Buy and shift to commuting using a privately-owned autonomous vehicle (PAV).
   (3) Shift to using a shared-autonomous vehicle (SAV), from a fleet of on-demand cars for your commute.
   A factor analysis determined five relevant latent variables describing the individuals' attitudes: technology interest, environmental concern, enjoy driving, public transit attitude, and pro-AV sentiments. The effects that the characteristics of the individual and the autonomous vehicle have on use and acceptance are quantified through random utility models including logit kernel model taking into account panel effects.
   Currently, large overall hesitations towards autonomous vehicle adoption exist, with 44% of choice decisions remaining regular vehicles. Early AV adopters will likely be young, students, more educated, and spend more time in vehicles. Even if the SAV service were to be completely free, only 75% of individuals would currently be willing to use SAVs. The study also found various differences regarding the preferences of individuals in Israel and North America, namely that Israelis are overall more likely to shift to autonomous vehicles.
   Methods to encourage SAV use include increasing the costs for regular cars as well as educating the public about the benefits of shared autonomous vehicles. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Improving access to transportation and ensuring transportation equity for persons with physical disabilities is one of the global challenges. Autonomous vehicles are pointed out as the potential solution to these problems. The views of persons with physical disabilities about autonomous vehicles differed sharply and substantially compared to non-disabled and other persons with disabilities. Therefore, this paper investigates differences in acceptance of autonomous vehicles among different groups of persons with physical disabilities. The driving status criterion was used because this fact significantly impacts the quality of life and social status. The paper's main contribution is to help create policies and practices related to autonomous vehicles following the real needs of persons with physical disabilities. The research was conducted in a country with vast problems of inclusion of persons with disabilities and transportation equity - Serbia. The Bayesian linear regression models were created with weakly informative prior distributions. We found that non-drivers with physical disabilities prefer to use autonomous vehicles more than drivers. The key issues of the successful introduction of autonomous vehicles are attitudes, accessibility, and trust. Autonomous vehicles present an excellent opportunity to improve mobility and trans-portation equity for non-drivers with physical disabilities. Transportation stakeholders, vehicle manufacturers, and representative associations of persons with disabilities should cooperate closely, respecting the concept & bdquo;Nothing about us, without us. ". One solution for resolving recognized challenges is introducing autonomous vehicles in the public transport system following accessibility, reliability, and safety principles.

AB Planning is one of the key problems for autonomous vehicles operating in road scenarios. Present planning algorithms operate with the assumption that traffic is organised in predefined speed lanes, which makes it impossible to allow autonomous vehicles in countries with unorganised traffic. Unorganised traffic is though capable of higher traffic bandwidths when constituting vehicles vary in their speed capabilities and sizes. Diverse vehicles in an unorganised exhibit unique driving behaviours which are analysed in this paper by a simulation study. The aim of the work reported here is to create a planning algorithm for mixed traffic consisting of both autonomous and non-autonomous vehicles without any inter-vehicle communication. The awareness (e.g. vision) of every vehicle is restricted to nearby vehicles only and a straight infinite road is assumed for decision making regarding navigation in the presence of multiple vehicles. Exhibited behaviours include obstacle avoidance, overtaking, giving way for vehicles to overtake from behind, vehicle following, adjusting the lateral lane position and so on. A conflict of plans is a major issue which will almost certainly arise in the absence of inter-vehicle communication. Hence each vehicle needs to continuously track other vehicles and rectify plans whenever a collision seems likely. Further it is observed here that driver aggression plays a vital role in overall traffic dynamics, hence this has also been factored in accordingly. This work is hence a step forward towards achieving autonomous vehicles in unorganised traffic, while similar effort would be required for planning problems such as intersections, mergers, diversions and other modules like localisation.

AB Autonomous vehicle navigation in an unknown dynamic environment is crucial for both supervised- and Reinforcement Learning-based autonomous maneuvering. The cooperative fusion of these two learning approaches has the potential to be an effective mechanism to tackle indefinite environmental dynamics. Most of the state-of-the-art autonomous vehicle navigation systems are trained on a specific mapped model with familiar environmental dynamics. However, this research focuses on the cooperative fusion of supervised and Reinforcement Learning technologies for autonomous navigation of land vehicles in a dynamic and unknown environment. The Faster R-CNN, a supervised learning approach, identifies the ambient environmental obstacles for untroubled maneuver of the autonomous vehicle. Whereas, the training policies of Double Deep Q-Learning, a Reinforcement Learning approach, enable the autonomous agent to learn effective navigation decisions form the dynamic environment. The proposed model is primarily tested in a gaming environment similar to the real-world. It exhibits the overall efficiency and effectiveness in the maneuver of autonomous land vehicles.

AB This paper focuses on autonomous navigation for an electric freight vehicle designed to collect freight autonomously using pallet handling robots installed in the vehicle. Apart from autonomous vehicle navigation, the primary hurdle for vehicle autonomy is the autonomous collection of freight irrespective of freight orientation/location. This research focuses on generating parking pose for the vehicle irrespective of the orientation of freight for its autonomous collection. Freight orientation is calculated by capturing the freight through onboard sensors. Afterward, this information creates a parking pose using mathematical equations and knowledge of the vehicle and freight collection limitations. Separate parking spots are generated for separate loading bays of the vehicle depending on the availability of the loading bay. Finally, results are captured and verified for different orientations of freight to conclude the research.

AB Air pollution, energy consumption, and human safety issues have aroused people's concern around the world. This phenomenon could be significantly alleviated with the development of automatic driving techniques, artificial intelligence, and computer science. Autonomous vehicles can be generally modularized as environment perception, path planning, and trajectory tracking. Trajectory tracking is a fundamental part of autonomous vehicles which controls the autonomous vehicles effectively and stably to track the reference trajectory that is predetermined by the path planning module. In this paper, a review of the state-of-the-art trajectory tracking of autonomous vehicles is presented. Both the trajectory tracking methods and the most commonly used trajectory tracking controllers of autonomous vehicles, besides state-of-art research studies of these controllers, are described.

AB Various studies have been conducted on resisting network attacks on autonomous vehicles and vehicular networks. Invaded vehicles may cause severe damage and casualties; thus, it is essential to stop these vehicles to prevent traffic accidents and terrorist attacks. To improve traffic safety, an active collision algorithm based on trajectory planning is therefore proposed. The algorithm can be used to cause autonomous vehicles to collide with invaded vehicles at intersections. Several types of trajectory planning algorithms have been proposed for autonomous vehicles in recent years. However, a few of these algorithms consider active collisions with other vehicles. The main advantage and novelty of the proposed method are that it can be utilised to plan a suitable trajectory for active collision with invaded vehicles at intersections. This capability has rarely been discussed in the literature to date. The main contributions of this study are that the problem of active collision of autonomous vehicles at intersections is discussed and an effective active collision algorithm based on trajectory planning is proposed. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated using simulation. The results show that the proposed algorithm is effective in enabling autonomous electric vehicles to collide with invaded vehicles at intersections.

AB With the concept of Internet-of-Things, autonomous vehicles can provide higher driving efficiency, traffic safety, and freedom for the driver to perform other tasks. This paper first covers enabling technology involving a vehicle moving out of parking, traveling on the road, and parking at the destination. The development of autonomous vehicles relies on the data collected for deployment in actual road conditions. Research gaps and recommendations for autonomous intelligent vehicles are included. For example, a sudden obstacle while the autonomous vehicle executes the parking trajectory on the road is discussed. Several aspects of social problems, such as the liability of an accident affecting the autonomous vehicle, are described. A smart device to detect abnormal driving behaviors to prevent possible accidents is briefly discussed.

AB This article presents a novel coordinated nonlinear adaptive backstepping collision avoidance control strategy for autonomous ground vehicles with uncertain and unmodeled terms. A nonlinear vehicle collision avoidance vehicle model which describes the coupled lateral and longitudinal dynamic features of autonomous ground vehicles is constructed. Then, a modified artificial potential field approach which can ensure that the total potential field of the target is goal minimum, is proposed to produce a collision-free trajectory for autonomous ground vehicles in real-time. Furthermore, in order to handle with the features of coupled and parameter uncertainties of autonomous ground vehicles, an adaptive neural network-based backstepping trajectory tracking control approach is proposed for collision avoidance control system of autonomous ground vehicles, and the stability of this proposed control system is proven by the Lyapunov theory. Finally, the co-simulation and experimental tests are implemented and the results show that the proposed collision avoidance control strategy has excellent tracking performance.

AB The adaptation of pavements to autonomous vehicles has become one of the main challenges in the field of road engineering. These infrastructures must provide a safer and comfortable circulation whilst helping to guide the vehicles and provide information about the status of the road. In spite of the significant advances that have been made in autonomous vehicles in recent years, the development of new pavements adapted to their use has been left behind. This paper presents some of the results obtained in a project aimed at developing an innovative asphalt material, which has been codified using magnetic particles in order facilitate the driving of autonomous vehicles. The results have demonstrated that these encoded materials are sufficiently sensitive to provide information to autonomous vehicles, and can be developed by using less invasive construction procedures.

AB The problem of motion planning of an autonomous vehicle amidst other vehicles on a straight road is considered. Traffic in a number of countries is unorganized, where the vehicles do not move within predefined speed lanes. In this paper, we formulate a mechanism wherein an autonomous vehicle may travel on the "wrong" side in order to overtake a vehicle. Challenges include assessing a possible overtaking opportunity, cooperating with other vehicles, partial driving on the "wrong" side of the road and safely going to and returning from the "wrong" side. The experimental results presented show vehicles cooperating to accomplish overtaking manoeuvres.

AB The problem of studying public transportation systems with autonomous vehicles is challenging because of behavioral differences that make existing models poorly fit and the technical difficulties involved in studying large autonomous systems operating on a grand scale. In this paper, we propose the following: (i) an autonomous transportation network setting; (ii) a method for modeling autonomous vehicles in simulation; and (iii) a high-performance simulation platform that allows analysis and visualization of transportation technologies. Results from microsimulation confirm theoretical benefits and improvements from employing autonomous systems in an example setting and highlight the platform's general ability to allow researchers to implement novel transportation systems and study the cost benefit variations occurring between them.

AB We analyzed and compared the effectiveness of the rotating seat of autonomous vehicles and that of an airbag in traditional vehicles as head protection measures in a frontal crash. Driver frontal crash models of traditional and autonomous vehicles and a head finite element model were established. Four evaluation indexes were used for comparison. The airbag proved more effective than seat rotation in terms of injury criteria and brain tissue injury risk under frontal crash conditions with and without brake involvement. A segmented protection measure based on crash acceleration values is proposed to improve crash safety in future autonomous vehicles.

Factors that also have to be considered are certainty and completeness of available information and trust in information sources and other entities. The paper discusses the problem of autonomous vehicle safety assurance and proposes dynamic situation assessment to cope with the problem of environment dynamics and incomplete and uncertain situation knowledge. The approach is presented for a simple example of a simulated autonomous vehicle. The situation awareness model and autonomous vehicle control system architecture is presented. The problems of justifying system safety are discussed.

AB The future innovation and growing popularity of autonomous vehicles have the potential to significantly impact the spatiotemporal distribution of parking demand. However, little knowledge is gained on how people will choose to park their autonomous cars. In principle, an autonomous vehicle is not necessarily parked close by like traditional vehicles leveraging the automated driving and parking capability, still, the decision made by people is important for policymakers in urban and transportation planning. This study attempts to gain useful insights to understand people's parking location choices for autonomous vehicles. A stated choice experiment was designed, allowing people to choose a parking location for autonomous vehicles in varied contexts, including time windows, picking-up times, and the requirement for on-time arrival at the next activity. We found that similar to conventional cars people generally prefer cheaper and/or closer parking lots for autonomous vehicles. However, the distance between a parking lot and the activity location is relatively longer in the case of autonomous vehicles. The amount of time an autonomous vehicle spends in congestion while picking up the users influences the choice of parking locations. Moreover, substantial preference heterogeneity between individual people was found in the parking choice behavior. The maximum value of access time for autonomous cars is 34 $/h which is higher than the empirical value of walking time for conventional cars. Results of elasticity indicate that the influence of parking fees is larger than that of access time and congestion time.

AB As autonomous vehicle technology advances rapidly, the design and operation of networks composed of fully autonomous vehicles have attracted immense interest. It is widely anticipated that fully autonomous vehicle networks will drastically improve performance. In this paper, we consider a widely studied problem, in which autonomous vehicles arriving at an intersection adjust their speeds to traverse the intersection as rapidly as possible, while avoiding collisions. We propose a coordination control algorithm, assuming stochastic models for the arrival times of the vehicles. The proposed algorithm extends the widely studied polling systems analysis to the case involving customers subject to second-order differential constraints. We provide provable guarantees on 1) safety, no collisions occur surely, and 2) performance, rigorous bounds on the expected delay. We also provide a stability analysis for the resulting queueing system. We demonstrate the algorithm in an extensive simulation study, providing one to two orders of magnitude improvement in delays over the traditional traffic light.

AB The emergence of autonomous driving vehicles on roads has increased the importance of research on autonomous driving in mixed-autonomous traffic. In mixed-autonomous traffic scenarios, it is necessary to comprehend the instability of autonomous vehicles and traffic flow corresponding to the uncertainty level in human-driven behaviors. However, studies of stability analysis in deep reinforcement learning are limited. This study focuses on the impact of deep reinforcement learning based autonomous vehicles in mixed-autonomous traffic from the stability perspective. We define the policy instability and traffic flow instabilities using the entropy of the velocity distributions to quantitatively measure the instability of an autonomous vehicle. Subsequently, we provide mathematical analyses to explain logarithmic growth patterns of instability. Moreover, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning approach that jointly determines discrete and continuous actions under partial observation. To verify the proposed solution, we perform extensive simulations of various traffic scenarios (e.g., increasing traffic volumes, increasing the number of autonomous vehicles on the road, and setting the multiple uncertainty levels for human-driven behaviors) with ablation studies on reward function. Moreover, we analyze instabilities when human-driven vehicles are modeled using the human-like noisy controller and a policy that imitates actual human-driving data based on imitation learning. The simulation results support the theoretical analysis and confirm that the proposed method is stabler compared to a conventional control-theoretic approach.

AB Along with the rapid development of autonomous driving technology, autonomous vehicles are showing a trend of practicality and popularity. Autonomous vehicles perceive environmental information through sensors to provide a basis for the decision making of vehicles. Based on this, this paper investigates the lane-changing decision-making behavior of autonomous vehicles. First, the similarity between autonomous vehicles and moving molecules is sought based on a system-similarity analysis. The microscopic lane-changing behavior of vehicles is analyzed by the molecular-dynamics theory. Based on the objective quantification of the lane-changing intention, the interaction potential is further introduced to establish the molecular-dynamics lane-changing model. Second, the relationship between the lane-changing initial time and lane-changing completed time, and the dynamic influencing factors of the lane changing, were systematically analyzed to explore the influence of the microscopic lane-changing behavior on the macroscopic traffic flow. Finally, the SL2015 lane-changing model was compared with the molecular-dynamics lane-changing model using the SUMO platform. SUMO is an open-source and multimodal traffic experimental platform that can realize and evaluate traffic research. The results show that the speed fluctuation of autonomous vehicles under the molecular-dynamics lane-changing model was reduced by 15.45%, and the number of passed vehicles was increased by 5.93%, on average, which means that it has better safety, stability, and efficiency. The molecular-dynamics lane-changing model of autonomous vehicles takes into account the dynamic factors in the traffic scene, and it reasonably shows the characteristics of the lane-changing behavior for autonomous vehicles.

AB The success of autonomous vehicles (AV hs) depends upon the effectiveness of sensors being used and the accuracy of communication links and technologies being employed. But these sensors and communication links have great security and safety concerns as they can be attacked by an adversary to take the control of an autonomous vehicle by influencing their data. Especially during the state estimation process for monitoring of autonomous vehicles' dynamics system, these concerns require immediate and effective solution. In this paper we present a new adversarial deep reinforcement learning algorithm (NDRL) that can be used to maximize the robustness of autonomous vehicle dynamics in the presence of these attacks. In this approach the adversary tries to insert defective data to the autonomous vehicle's sensor readings so that it can disrupt the safe and optimal distance between the autonomous vehicles traveling on the road. The attacker tries to make sure that there is no more safe and optimal distance between the autonomous vehicles, thus it may lead to the road accidents. Further attacker can also add fake data in such a way that it leads to reduced traffic flow on the road. On the other hand, autonomous vehicle will try to defend itself from these types of attacks by maintaining the safe and optimal distance i.e. by minimizing the deviation so that adversary does not succeed in its mission. This attacker-autonomous vehicle action reaction can be studied through the game theory formulation with incorporating the deep learning tools. Each autonomous vehicle will use Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM)-Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models to find out the anticipated distance variation resulting from its actions and input this to the new deep reinforcement learning algorithm (NDRL) which attempts to reduce the variation in distance. Whereas attacker also chooses deep reinforcement learning algorithm (NDRL) and wants to maximize the distance variation between the autonomous vehicles. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Creating sustainable urban futures partly requires reducing car-use and transport induced stresses on the environment and society. New transport technologies such as autonomous vehicles are increasingly assuming prominence in debates about the transition toward sustainable urban futures. Yet, enormous uncertainties currently exist on how autonomous vehicles might shape urban mobility. To address this gap, this paper examines the latent behavioural and socio-demographic factors that will drive the adoption of and preferences for different use options of autonomous vehicles, utilizing survey data from Dublin, Republic of Ireland. Based on this, it explores how autonomous vehicles might shape travel behaviors through mode choice and the potential sustainability implications. The findings show that regarding preferences for a specific alternative (i.e. sharing, ownership and public transport), attitudes toward these use options matter the most, rather than overall perceived benefits of autonomous vehicles. Moreover, for single mode options, shared-autonomous vehicles remain the least popular, while preference for ownership of autonomous vehicles, either as a single option or in combination with sharing and public transport, is high. Across the different autonomous vehicles options, there is high preference for clean engine fuel sources (i.e. electric and hybrid). Given the embeddedness of preferences for autonomous vehicles in attitudes and choices regarding existing forms of motorized transport, it is possible that the current modal split and the large share of private car-based transport, might not change in the era of autonomous mobility. However, urban transport policy can leverage the overall positive attitudes toward the environment, sharing and public transit to nudge choices toward achieving the normative goals of sustainable urban transport.

AB Advanced deep reinforcement learning shows promise as an approach to addressing continuous control tasks, especially in mixed-autonomy traffic. In this study, we present a deep reinforcement-learning-based model that considers the effectiveness of leading autonomous vehicles in mixed-autonomy traffic at a non-signalized intersection. This model integrates the Flow framework, the simulation of urban mobility simulator, and a reinforcement learning library. We also propose a set of proximal policy optimization hyperparameters to obtain reliable simulation performance. First, the leading autonomous vehicles at the non-signalized intersection are considered with varying autonomous vehicle penetration rates that range from 10% to 100% in 10% increments. Second, the proximal policy optimization hyperparameters are input into the multiple perceptron algorithm for the leading autonomous vehicle experiment. Finally, the superiority of the proposed model is evaluated using all human-driven vehicle and leading human-driven vehicle experiments. We demonstrate that full-autonomy traffic can improve the average speed and delay time by 1.38 times and 2.55 times, respectively, compared with all human-driven vehicle experiments. Our proposed method generates more positive effects when the autonomous vehicle penetration rate increases. Additionally, the leading autonomous vehicle experiment can be used to dissipate the stop-and-go waves at a non-signalized intersection.

AB Autonomous vehicles are going to be used in warehouses or logistic centers more frequently in near future. The location information is vital for autonomous vehicles to accomplish tasks that are assigned to them. This study presents a wireless sensor network to be used in location estimation of autonomous vehicles. The autonomous vehicles estimate their distance to a specific node called as reference anchor node. The aim of the proposed method is to be able get more accurate distance estimations by received signal strength for autonomous vehicles. The proposed wireless sensor network provides sufficient information to the autonomous vehicles to reduce their received signal strength based estimation error. An adaptive filter based algorithm to reduce estimation error is proposed. The performance of the proposed method is validated by simulations and experiments. According to results of the simulations where ideal conditions are provided, maximum error of the proposed method is 0.81m. According to results of the experiments, the average absolute error of the proposed method can be as low as 1.272m. When the proposed method is compared with k-nearest neighbor distance estimation and conventional approach, it has a significantly lower error than them.

AB Autonomous Vehicle technology is quickly expanding its market and has found in Silicon Valley, California, a strong foothold for preliminary testing on public roads. In an effort to promote safety and transparency to consumers, the California Department of Motor Vehicles has mandated that reports of accidents involving autonomous vehicles be drafted and made available to the public. The present work shows an in-depth analysis of the accident reports filed by different manufacturers that are testing autonomous vehicles in California (testing data from September 2014 to March 2017). The data provides important information on autonomous vehicles accidents' dynamics, related to the most frequent types of collisions and impacts, accident frequencies, and other contributing factors. The study also explores important implications related to future testing and validation of semi-autonomous vehicles, tracing the investigation back to current literature as well as to the current regulatory panorama.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) manoeuvring in unknown environment require path-planning algorithms that are safe, yet optimal to circumvent dynamic obstacles with minimum fuel-cost. This investigation presents an autonomous vehicle path-planning (AVPP) controller that uses mixed integer linear programming to decide the blending and switching actions among possible vehicle behaviours depending on local sensed information. Our results illustrate the safety and optimality of the controller for AVPP in unknown environments with dynamic obstacles. Comparison with existing methods shows that the proposed method is more robust to collisions than the fuzzy and extended Kalman filter based arbitration mechanism studied in literature. Further, as behaviours breakdown the complex path-planning problem into simple tasks, controller realisation becomes simple.

ID VEHICLES
AB The concept of a semi-autonomous adaptive cruise control (SAACC) system is developed, which enjoys significant advantages over present day adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems in terms of highway safety and traffic flow capacity. The semi-autonomous systems combine the deployment advantages of autonomous vehicles with the performance advantages of fully automated highway systems (AHSs) in which vehicles operate cooperatively as a platoon. Unlike platoon systems, the semi-autonomous systems will be immediately deployable on present day highways, where both manually driven and adaptive cruise controlled vehicles can coexist. The theoretical results in this paper show that the proposed system would be able to safely maintain smaller time gaps, would be string stable, and would be guaranteed to have smaller actuator inputs than a standard autonomous ACC system. The simulation results in the paper indicate that more accurate and smoother tracking, smaller time gaps, smaller control efforts, and increased robustness to vehicle dynamics are achieved by semi-autonomous control.

AB Since the autonomous vehicle is intended to simulate a human driver's behaviour, it is very helpful to introduce a driver model to the design of the autonomous vehicle controller. The intention of this paper is to exhibit the approaches of building a longitudinally and laterally integrated driver model and the methods of applying the model in autonomous vehicle control. A series of simulations is undertaken in typical driving conditions such as double lane change, speed or position following in straight line, braking-in-turn, high-speed U turn, etc. During the entire course of the simulations, the driver model has demonstrated the great accuracy in terms of following both the path and the vehicle speeds. It can be concluded that this particular type of driver model is highly applicable in autonomous vehicle control.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle is a class of intelligent robots, which has been widely used in ocean observatory. Inductive power transmission is a good way to supply power and extend the working endurance of autonomous underwater vehicle. The power transfer characteristic depends on the electromagnetic actuator. A novel electromagnetic actuator has been proposed for different traditional autonomous underwater vehicle docking applications in this study. At first, the structure of electromagnetic actuator and assembled configurations for autonomous underwater vehicle submerged docks was given. Then, the mutual-coupling circuit and reluctance model were built. At last, in order to verify and test this electromagnetic actuator's power transfer characteristics, an underwater test setup was built and used in both laboratory experiment and in a modeled autonomous underwater vehicle power cabin. The test results showed that the novel electromagnetic actuator could reach the highest power transmission efficiency of 78.1% at the frequency of 115 kHz, while the output power of inductive power transmission system is 75W at 5 mm gap in working condition. Thus, it is suitable for autonomous underwater vehicle power feeding.

AB The introduction of fully autonomous vehicles is approaching. This warrants a re-consideration of road crash liability, given drivers will have diminished control. This study, underpinned by attribution theory, investigated blame attribution to different road transport system actors following crashes involving manually driven, semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles. It also examined whether outcome severity alters blame ratings. 396 participants attributed blame to five actors (vehicle driver/user, pedestrian, vehicle, manufacturer, government) in vehicle-pedestrian crash scenarios. Different and unique patterns of blame were found across actors, according to the three vehicle types. In crashes involving fully autonomous vehicles, vehicle users received low blame, while vehicle manufacturers and government were highly blamed. There was no difference in the level of blame attributed between high and low severity crashes regarding vehicle type. However, the government received more blame in high severity crashes. The findings have implications for policy and legislation surrounding crash liability. Practitioner summary: Public views relating to blame and liability in transport accidents is a vital consideration for the introduction of new technologies such as autonomous vehicles. This study demonstrates how a systems ergonomics framework can assist to identify the implications of changing public opinion on blame for future road transport systems.

AB Connected autonomous vehicles are considered as mitigators of issues such as traffic congestion, road safety, inefficient fuel consumption and pollutant emissions that current road transportation system suffers from. Connected autonomous vehicles utilise communication systems to enhance the performance of autonomous vehicles and consequently improve transportation by enabling cooperative functionalities, namely, cooperative sensing and cooperative manoeuvring. The former refers to the ability to share and fuse information gathered from vehicle sensors and road infrastructures to create a better understanding of the surrounding environment while the latter enables groups of vehicles to drive in a co-ordinated way which ultimately results in a safer and more efficient driving environment. However, there is a gap in understanding how and to what extent connectivity can contribute to improving the efficiency, safety and performance of autonomous vehicles. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate the potential benefits that can be achieved from connected autonomous vehicles through analysing five use-cases: (i) vehicle platooning, (ii) lane changing, (iii) intersection management, (iv) energy management and (v) road friction estimation. The current paper highlights that although connectivity can enhance the performance of autonomous vehicles and contribute to the improvement of current transportation system performance, the level of achievable benefits depends on factors such as the penetration rate of connected vehicles, traffic scenarios and the way of augmenting off-board information into vehicle control systems.

This paper presents a knowledge model, which includes problem description layer and problem-solving knowledge layer. The automatic driving decision knowledge base of unmanned vehicle is composed of a set of knowledge models. Knowledge model supports knowledge representation and reasoning. Based on the WEB visualization knowledge modeling tool and visualization knowledge service tool, we construct the decision-making knowledge base management system for autonomous driving of unmanned vehicles and then construct the autonomous driving decision-making system of unmanned vehicles. The reasoning example shows that the knowledge base management system can effectively improve the knowledge acquisition, representation and maintenance efficiency of autonomous driving decision-making system, which is of great significance in enhancing the intelligence level of autonomous driving decision-making system.

AB Nowadays, autonomous vehicle is an active research area, especially after the emergence of machine vision tasks with deep learning. In such a visual navigation system for autonomous vehicle, the controller captures images and predicts information so that the autonomous vehicle can safely navigate. In this paper, we first introduced small and medium-sized obstacles that were intentionally or unintentionally left on the road, which can pose hazards for both autonomous and human driving situations. Then, we discuss Markov random field (MRF) model by fusing three potentials (gradient potential, curvature prior potential, and depth variance potential) to segment the obstacles and non-obstacles into the hazardous environment. Since the segment of obstacles is done by MRF model, we can predict the information to safely navigate the autonomous vehicle form hazardous environment on the roadway by DNN model. We found that our proposed method can segment the obstacles accuracy from the blended background road and improve the navigation skills of the autonomous vehicle.

AB This article presents an in-depth review of path following control strategies that are applicable to a wide range class of marine, ground, and aerial autonomous robotic vehicles. From a control system standpoint, path following can be formulated as the problem of stabilizing a path following error system that describes the dynamics of position and possibly orientation errors of a vehicle with respect to a path, with the errors defined in an appropriate reference frame. In spite of the large variety of path following methods described in the literature we show that, in principle, most of them can be categorized in two groups: stabilization of the path following error system expressed either in the vehicle's body frame or in a frame attached to a "reference point" moving along the path, such as a Frenet-Serret (F-S) frame or a Parallel Transport (P-T) frame. With this observation, we provide a unified formulation that is simple but general enough to cover many methods available in the literature. We then discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method, comparing them from the design and implementation standpoint. We further show experimental results of the path following methods obtained from field trials testing with under-actuated and over-actuated autonomous marine vehicles. In addition, we introduce open-source Matlab and Gazebo/ROS simulation toolboxes that are helpful in testing path following methods before their integration in the combined guidance, navigation, and control systems of autonomous vehicles.

AB Stereo vision is widely used in many 3-D image applications. In this paper, a system based on stereo vision concepts has been developed with the goal to measure the velocity of vehicles using images. Using this method, an autonomous vehicle is able to measure its velocity using only a single camera. From a sequence of images, the method uses techniques to locate homologous points and then estimates the velocity of the vehicle. The experimental results validate the application of the proposed method to autonomous vehicles.

AB Safe motion planning for autonomous vehicles is a challenging task, since the exact future motion of other traffic participant is usually unknown. In this article, we present a verification technique ensuring that autonomous vehicles do not cause collisions by using fail-safe trajectories. Fail-safe trajectories are executed if the intended motion of the autonomous vehicle causes a safety-critical situation. Our verification technique is real-time capable and operates under the premise that intended trajectories are only executed if they have been verified as safe. The benefits of our proposed approach are demonstrated in different scenarios on an actual vehicle. Moreover, we present the first in-depth analysis of our verification technique used in dense urban traffic. Our results indicate that fail-safe motion planning has the potential to drastically reduce accidents while not resulting in overly conservative behaviors of the autonomous vehicle.

ID LEVEL
AB Reinforcementlearning holds the promise of allowing autonomous vehicles to learn complex decision making behaviors through interacting with other traffic participants. However, many real-world driving tasks involve unpredictable perception errors or measurement noises which may mislead an autonomous vehicle into making unsafe decisions, even cause catastrophic failures. In light of these risks, to ensure safety under perception uncertainty, autonomous vehicles are required to be able to cope with the worst case observation perturbations. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel observation adversarial reinforcement learning approach for robust lane change decision making of autonomous vehicles. A constrained observation-robust Markov decision process is presented to model lane change decision making behaviors of autonomous vehicles under policy constraints and observation uncertainties. Meanwhile, a black-box attack technique based on Bayesian optimization is implemented to approximate the optimal adversarial observation perturbations efficiently. Furthermore, a constrained observation-robust actor-critic algorithm is advanced to optimize autonomous driving lane change policies while keeping the variations of the policies attacked by the optimal adversarial observation perturbations within bounds. Finally, the robust lane change decision making approach is evaluated in three stochastic mixed traffic flows based on different densities. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can not only enhance the performance of an autonomous vehicle but also improve the robustness of lane change policies against adversarial observation perturbations.

AB This paper presents several control and perception components that implement navigation behaviours in autonomous vehicles. A behaviour-based control architecture integrating these components is also presented. The paper concentrates on autonomous tracking behaviours. In particular, the tracking of explicit paths, moving targets and environmental features are described. These behaviours have been implemented using several different position estimation techniques: dead reckoning; global position estimation using GPS; and position estimation with respect to the environment. The control architecture has been implemented in ROMEO vehicles at the University of Seville. These autonomous vehicles are adaptated from conventional electric vehicles and are currently used for experiments in autonomous navigation and teleoperation in outdoor environments. A short description of the general characteristics of the ROMEO-3R (tricycle) and ROMEO-4R (four wheels) vehicles is presented. The paper includes results from the tracking of environmenal features with proximity sensors, and visual tracking of moving targets. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID FRAMEWORK; SYSTEMS
AB Policy makers predict that autonomous vehicles will have significant market penetration in the next decade or so. In several simulation studies shared autonomous vehicle fleets have been shown to be effective public transit alternatives. This study compared the effectiveness of a shared autonomous vehicle Heel with an upcoming transit project proposed in New York City, the Brooklyn-Queens Connector light rail project. The study developed an event-based simulation model to compare the performance of the shared autonomous vehicle system with the light rail system under the same demand patterns, route alignment, and operating speeds. The simulation experiments revealed that a shared autonomous vehicle fleet of 500 vehicles of 12-person capacity (consistent with the EZ10 vehicle) would be needed to match the 39-vehicle light rail system if operated as a fixed-route system. However, as a demand-responsive system, a fleet of only 150 vehicles would lead to the same total travel time (22 min) as the 39-vehicle heel light rail system. Furthermore, a fleet of 450 12-person vehicles in a demand-responsive operation would have the same average wait limes while reducing total travel limes by 36%. The implications for system resiliency, idle vehicle allocation, and vehicle modularity are discussed.

AB As it combines Al and IoT, autonomous driving has attracted a great deal of attention from both academia and industry because of its benefits to the economy and society. However, ultra-low delay and ultra-high reliability cannot be guaranteed by individual autonomous vehicles with limited intelligence and the existing architectures of the Internet of Vehicles. In this article, based on a cloud/fog-computing pattern and the IoT Al service framework, we propose a cross-domain solution for auto-driving. In contrast to existing studies, which mainly focus on communication technologies, our solution achieves intelligent and flexible autonomous driving task processing and enhances transportation performance with the help of the Cognitive Internet of Vehicles. We first present an overview of the enabling technology and the architecture of the Cognitive Internet of Vehicles for autonomous driving. Then we discuss the autonomous driving Cognitive Internet of Vehicles specifically from the perspectives of what to compute, where to compute, and how to compute. Simulations are then conducted to prove the effect of the Cognitive Internet of Vehicles for autonomous driving. Our study explores the research value and opportunities of the Cognitive Internet of Vehicles in autonomous driving.

AB Due to the great achievements in artificial intelligence, it is predicted that autonomous vehicles with little or even no human involvement will come to market in the near future. Autonomous vehicles are equipped with multiple types of sensors. An autonomous vehicle relies on its sensors to perceive its environment, and this sensory information plays a key role in the vehicle's driving decisions. Hence, ensuring the trustworthiness of the sensor data is crucial for drivers' safety. In this article, we discuss the impact of perception error attacks (PEAs) on autonomous vehicles, and propose a countermeasure called LIFE (LIDAR and Image data Fusion for detecting perception Errors). LIFE detects PEAs by analyzing the consistency between camera image data and LIDAR data using novel machine learning and computer vision algorithms. The performance of LIFE has been evaluated extensively using the KITTI dataset.

AB Manoeuvring in the presence of emergency vehicles is still a major issue for vehicle autonomy systems. Most studies that address this topic are based on rule-based methods, which cannot cover all possible scenarios that can take place in autonomous traffic. Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimisation (MAPPO) has recently emerged as a powerful method for autonomous systems because it allows for training in thousands of different situations. In this study, we present an approach based on MAPPO to guarantee the safe and efficient manoeuvring of autonomous vehicles in the presence of an emergency vehicle. We introduce a risk metric that summarises the potential risk of collision in a single index. The proposed method generates cooperative policies allowing the emergency vehicle to go at 15% higher average speed while maintaining high safety distances. Moreover, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our method in a wide range of scenarios, including assessing the trade-offs between traffic efficiency and safety, measuring the scalability of the approach with respect to the number of autonomous vehicles, analysing different distributions of mixed human and autonomous traffic, and examining the various levels of cooperation and competition among agents.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) with their immaculate sensing and navigating capabilities are expected to revolutionize urban mobility. Despite the expected benefits, this emerging technology has certain implications pertaining to their deployment in mixed traffic streams, owing to different driving logics than Human-driven Vehicles (HVs). Many researchers have been working to devise a sustainable urban transport system by considering the operational and safety aspects of mixed traffic during the transition phase. However, limited scholarly attention has been devoted to mapping an overview of this research area. This paper attempts to map the state of the art of scientific production about autonomous vehicles in mixed traffic conditions, using a bibliometric analysis of 374 documents extracted from the Scopus database from 1999 to 2021. The VOSviewer 1.1.18 and Biblioshiny 3.1 software were used to demonstrate the progress status of the publications concerned. The analysis revealed that the number of publications has continuously increased during the last five years. The text analysis showed that the author keywords "autonomous vehicles" and "mixed traffic" dominated the other author keywords because of their frequent occurrence. From thematic analysis, three research stages associated with AVs were identified; pre-development (1999-2017), development (2017-2020) and deployment (2021). The study highlighted the potential research areas, such as involvement of autonomous vehicles in transportation planning, interaction between autonomous vehicles and human driven vehicles, traffic and energy efficiencies associated with automated driving, penetration rates for autonomous vehicles in mixed traffic scenarios, and safe and efficient operation of autonomous vehicles in mixed traffic environment. Additionally, discussion on the three key aspects was conducted, including the impacts of AVs, their driving characteristics and strategies for their successful deployment in context of mixed traffic. This paper provides ample future directions to the people willing to work in this area of autonomous vehicles in mixed traffic conditions. The study also revealed current trends as well as potential future hotspots in the area of autonomous vehicles in mixed traffic.

AB Autonomous vehicle technology based on information technology and software will lead the automotive industry in the near future. Vehicle localization technology is a core expertise geared toward developing autonomous vehicles and will provide location information for control and decision. This paper proposes an effective vision-based localization technology to be applied to autonomous vehicles. In particular, the proposed technology makes use of numerical maps that are widely used in the field of geographic information systems and that have already been built in advance. Optimum vehicle ego-motion estimation and road marking feature extraction techniques are adopted and then combined by an extended Kalman filter and particle filter to make up the localization technology. The implementation results of this paper show remarkable results; namely, an 18 ms mean processing time and 10 cm location error. In addition, autonomous driving and parking are successfully completed with an unmanned vehicle within a 300 m x 500 m space.

AB This study presents the path-following control design for a group of autonomous underwater vehicles in a plane with obstacle and collision avoidance. A distributed backstepping controller is exploited for an autonomous vehicle to design a path-following controller. Then, the controller is applied for the path-following of a group of autonomous vehicle systems in the formation setting. The graph theory is used to model the interconnection between the vehicles. To avoid obstacles and collisions, a dynamic limit-cycle-based algorithm is proposed. It is assumed that each obstacle is involved an elliptical shape and if the collision or conflict of one vehicle to the surrounded environmental obstacles is detected, the obstacle avoidance algorithm will be active to prevent collisions. Finally, the introduced algorithm is implemented and simulated for a group of underwater autonomous vehicles in MATLAB software. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed distributed controller apparently.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles play an essential role in geophysical data collection, deep water mining, seafloor mapping, ocean exploration, and in many other related activities starting from military to scientific applications. A detailed understanding of hydrodynamic characteristics will lead to better design, better control, and optimal path planning of autonomous underwater vehicles in the deepest corner of oceans. This article will provide a detailed review of the hydrodynamic characteristics of autonomous underwater vehicles, starting from different experimental techniques used in the analysis of hydrodynamic parameters, methods used for fixing the autonomous underwater vehicles in towing tank, instruments used for measurement of the hydrodynamic parameters. Furthermore, numerical methods employed in performing computational analysis, hydrodynamics-based shape optimization, studies on drag reduction, and finally a detailed list of turbulence models used in the computational fluid dynamics-related numerical simulations. The hydrodynamics-based optimal shape of the autonomous underwater vehicles, the best technique to predict the hydrodynamic parameters, and the best turbulence model for the computational fluid dynamics-based prediction of hydrodynamic parameters will be recommended. At last, the hydrodynamic characteristics of different bio-inspired autonomous underwater vehicles are discussed.

AB This study examines the benefits and drawbacks of autonomous public transit vehicles among 210 Indonesians. Some 25% of respondents knew nothing about driverless vehicles, whereas 14% did. The average 5-point Likert scale response was 3.12 (SD = 1.05), indicating intermediate expertise. Some 42% of respondents used autonomous vehicle sources such as public transport, 47% had no experience, and 11% were doubtful. The survey items' Cronbach's alpha score is 0.873, indicating strong internal consistency and reliability. Most respondents supported the deployment of autonomous road vehicles for public transportation and said they would improve public transportation quality and accessibility. Technical issues and legal liabilities worried responders. The mean scores for the seven autonomous car benefits were similar, showing that respondents did not strongly prefer any benefit. After assessing the socioeconomic status and concerns, the study indicated that people who saw greater benefits were more tolerant of autonomous vehicles. Most respondents also wanted a clearer explanation of their legal responsibilities in case of an accident, thought human operators should play a major role in the future, and supported government trials of autonomous vehicles before their widespread usage. The study's findings can help policymakers and stakeholders increase public acceptance of new transportation solutions such as autonomous vehicles, and improve future mobility safety and sustainability.

ID MODEL-CHECKING
AB The coordination of multiple autonomous vehicles into convoys or platoons is expected on our highways in the near future. However, before such platoons can be deployed, the behaviours of the vehicles in these platoons must be certified. This is non-trivial and goes beyond current certification requirements, for human-controlled vehicles, in that these vehicles can act autonomously. In this paper, we show how formal verification can contribute to the analysis of these new, and increasingly autonomous, systems. An appropriate overall representation for vehicle platooning is as a multi-agent system in which each agent captures the "autonomous decisions" carried out by each vehicle. In order to ensure that these autonomous decision-making agents in vehicle platoons never violate safety requirements, we use formal verification. However, as the formal verification technique used to verify the individual agent's code does not scale to the full system, and as the global system verification technique does not capture the essential verification of autonomous behaviour, we use a combination of the two approaches. This mixed strategy allows us to verify safety requirements not only of a model of the system, but of the actual agent code used to program the autonomous vehicles. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB Addressing decision safety in the unpredictable arena of complex traffic scenarios represents a significant hurdle for autonomous driving systems. Considering the inherent spatial-temporal uncertainties associated with the future actions of surrounding traffic participants, real-time safety verification of autonomous driving decisions is crucial to maintaining vehicular safety. Existing online verification methodologies, such as Responsibility Sensitive Safety (RSS) and Safety Force Field (SFF), ensure driving safety by formalizing human safe-driving rules and constraining the vehicle to maintain safe lateral and longitudinal distances in real-time. While these methods effectively prevent collisions instigated by the autonomous vehicle itself, they lack sufficient foresight and often result in less smooth driving trajectories. To address these limitations, we propose an innovative, interpretable, formal safety verification framework. This approach integrates both explicit and implicit traffic rules to anticipate all legally acceptable transitions of traffic scenarios. It builds the lawful, short-term reachable region for each vehicle, and verifies the safety of autonomous vehicle decisions by assessing whether the regions these vehicles inhabit, in accordance with the expected trajectory, overlap with the accessible zones of other vehicles. Furthermore, in scenarios presenting potential danger, a backup smooth safety trajectory is derived from the autonomous vehicle's legal reachability domain as a preventive measure to degrade safety threats. As a cornerstone of safety for autonomous vehicles, our proposed method ensures a continual safe trajectory in all traffic scenarios, provided that other participants adhere to traffic rules. Experimental outcomes, grounded in the ISO 34502 standard and real-world critical safety scenarios, demonstrate the method's efficacy in identifying potentially dangerous decisions and mitigating autonomous vehicle-induced traffic accidents.

AB The connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) will never be completely autonomous; on the contrary, it will be heavily dependent on so-called vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) for its function. To deserve the trust of the general public, the vehicles as well as the intelligent transport system (ITS) infrastructure must be able to handle not only natural disturbances but also attacks of malicious nature. In this paper, we discuss the effects of antagonistic attacks using intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI) and how the antagonistic nature of the threat renders probabilistic risk analysis inadequate for the defense of the vehicles and the infrastructure. Instead, we propose a shift toward resilience engineering and vulnerability analysis to manage antagonistic threats. Finally, we also give two examples of possible scenarios to illustrate the type of situations a CAV must be able to handle.

ID AUTOMATED VEHICLES; POLICY
AB Vehicle producers, universities, and technology companies, among others, are today involved in the development of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Ongoing in several countries are experimental activities in actual traffic situations. The legal conditions for autonomous vehicles, however, vary by country. A number of countries have introduced, or are considering introducing, rules for such activities. Some countries see autonomous vehicles as prohibited unless otherwise stated in the regulations, while other countries take exactly the opposite view, i.e., anything not explicitly prohibited is allowed. This paper introduces a regulatory governance perspective on autonomous vehicles. It describes how new regulatory standards are being shaped for emerging technologies in the transport sector using the case of autonomous vehicles in Sweden and Norway. The findings show how regulations are shaped by external pressures and that international conventions are influencing regulatory design. It also concludes that the final regulations hold some degree of flexibility but also that specific restrictions may be hindering advanced experiments. By introducing a theoretical perspective on regulatory governance of AVs, the paper contributes to a further understanding of how to analyse the shape of new regulation in the transport sector generally.

TI Can Autonomous Vehicles Save Fuel? Findings from Field Experiments

LA English
DT Article
ID CONSUMPTION; BEHAVIOR; MODEL
AB The majority of the more recent studies have mainly focused on how to achieve energy-efficient goals by optimizing the driving behavior for human-driven vehicles or designing trajectory planning and tacking algorithms for autonomous vehicles. However, the energy-saving advantages of autonomous vehicles have not been quantitatively and theoretically explored. Therefore, this study aims to specifically clarify whether autonomous vehicles use less fuel than human-driven ones. First, the differences in driving behavior, regarding speed control, between autonomous vehicles and human-driven vehicles were compared. The most notable difference between them is that an autonomous vehicle can control the vehicle speed more effectively, with less speed fluctuations than a human driver. Subsequently, the influence of speed fluctuation on vehicle fuel consumption (L/100 km) was formulated based on the vehicle specific power (VSP) model. The mathematical deduction showed that the fuel consumption is proportional to the speed fluctuation under the same mean speed. Finally, simulation experiments were conducted under real scenarios. The simulation data showed that the fuel consumption increases almost linearly with the increase in speed fluctuation. Field experiments were also conducted on the fuel consumption of an autonomous vehicle under different driving modes. The experimental data showed that the fuel consumption also increases almost linearly with the increase in speed fluctuation. In the human-driven mode, the fuel consumption increased by 5.6% and 14.7%, respectively, compared with that in the autonomous mode at average speeds of 20 km/h and 40 km/h. Furthermore, the maximum fuel consumption was up to 60% more when the autonomous vehicle was driven by a driver, as the driving behavior displayed greater speed fluctuations.

AB Autonomous vehicle systems within an intelligent transportation systems (ITS) paradigm have attracted continuously increasing interest from both academia and the industry. Safety is a key characteristic; without safety, the dream of autonomous vehicles cannot come true. This paper focuses on vehicle safety aspects and proposes a new conceptual framework, supported by a consolidated, international normative risk management process and is based on a safety-critical architecture brought from an analogous transportation domain, to design and to implement an autonomous supervision and control system (SCS). This SCS approach, based on automotive cyber physical systems (ACPSs) and called autonomous ACPS, aims to minimize the probability of vehicle collision hazard by employing resilient actions at run-time, reducing risks related to potential loss of human lives in the automotive transportation domain.

AB This study presents smooth and fast feasible trajectory generation for autonomous driving vehicles subject to the vehicle physical constraints on the vehicle power, speed, acceleration as well as the hard limitations of the vehicle steering angle and the steering angular speed. This is due to the fact the vehicle speed and the vehicle steering angle are always in a strict relationship for safety purposes, depending on the real vehicle driving constraints, the environmental conditions, and the surrounding obstacles. Three different methods of the position quintic polynomial, speed quartic polynomial, and symmetric polynomial function for generating the vehicle trajectories are presented and illustrated with simulations. The optimal trajectory is selected according to three criteria: Smoother curve, smaller tracking error, and shorter distance. The outcomes of this paper can be used for generating online trajectories for autonomous driving vehicles and auto-parking systems.

LA English
DT Article
DE Autonomous vehicles; Driverless vehicles; Ethics; Values; Regulation
ID EUTHANASIA; POLICY; GOVERNANCE
AB This article captures the implications of technology supportive of high level autonomous vehicles eclipsing the capacity of regulators to respond. To date, policy makers and industry actors have avoided confronting the impending gap, a consequence of the fact that current levels of vehicle autonomy are sufficiently low that accountability for decision-making affecting the operation of vehicles still resides with the driver. However, as automotive firms achieve higher levels of vehicle autonomy and control shifts to the vehicle itself and the infrastructure supporting it, the preponderance of responsibility will transfer to different actors: automotive firms, autonomous vehicle programmers, and policy makers. This article explains and quantifies the challenges that will arise as that process unfolds. It does this by introducing four ethics and value-based foundations that can be used to guide programming of decisions to be made by autonomous vehicles. The purpose is not to recommend a specific ethics or value-based foundation for programming high level autonomous vehicles. Rather, by programming dilemma-inducing scenarios and then directing outcomes on the basis of distinct ethical or values-based foundations, we quantifiably demonstrate that autonomous vehicle programming decisions, whether they are guided by a particular ethical foundation or moral code or not, manifest in tangibly different outcomes. Through this, we introduce and discuss challenges - many not considered previously - associated with programming and regulating high level autonomous vehicles. Based on that, we consider implications for policy as well as the long-term proliferation of the technology.

AB This study investigates the impact of environmental concerns, concerns about potential accidents, and the perceived advantages of fully autonomous vehicles on individuals' willingness to buy and the perceived value of these vehicles. Our research, conducted through a comprehensive survey with over 180,000 respondents in Japan and analyzed using structural equation modeling, reveals a nuanced disparity between willingness to buy and perceived value. We find that individuals concerned with the conservation of the natural environment are more likely to purchase fully autonomous vehicles due to their broader interest in societal issues and belief in the potential of new technologies like fully autonomous vehicles as solutions. However, these individuals attribute a lower perceived value to these vehicles, mainly because their adoption does not directly contribute to the conservation of the natural environment. Additionally, our results show that those recognizing the potential advantages of fully autonomous vehicle technology have a higher willingness to buy and perceived value, while those with apprehensions about the technology are less likely to purchase and attribute a lower perceived value to these vehicles. This study offers vital insights for policy and planning, highlighting the complex interplay of factors influencing the willingness to buy and perceived value of fully autonomous vehicles, critical for strategizing their adoption.

AB The autonomous vehicles need to cooperate with the nearby vehicles to ensure driving safety, however, it is challenging to plan and follow the desired trajectory considering the nearby vehicles. This article proposes a cooperative driving strategy for the connected vehicles by integrating vehicle velocity prediction, motion planning, and robust fuzzy path-following control. The system uncertainties are considered to enhance the cooperation between the autonomous vehicle and the nearby vehicle. With the driving information obtained from the connected vehicles technique, the recurrent neural network is used to predict the nearby vehicle velocity. A motion planner is developed to provide the reference trajectory considering the velocity prediction errors. Then, a robust fuzzy path-following controller is designed to track the planned trajectory. The CarSim simulations are conducted to validate the proposed cooperative driving strategy. The simulation results show that the autonomous vehicle can avoid collisions with the nearby vehicle by applying the proposed driving strategy in the overtaking and the lane-changing scenarios.

AB In order to properly operate an autonomous vehicle navigation system, it is important that the vehicle and sensor models of the vehicle are defined by an accurate parameter set. This paper presents a technique for identifying parameters of an autonomous vehicle using multi-objective optimization, which enables the identification process without introducing additional parameters. A multi-objective optimization method has been further proposed to solve the optimization problem defined for the identification efficiently and promisingly. Results of numerical examples first show that the proposed optimization method can work well for various multi-objective optimization problems. Then, the proposed identification technique has been applied to the actual parameter identification of the autonomous vehicle developed by the authors, and an appropriate parameter set has been obtained.

   FRAMEWORK
AB With the forecasted emergence of autonomous vehicles in urban traffic networks, new control policies are needed to leverage their potential for reducing congestion. While several efforts have studied the fully autonomous traffic control problem, there is a lack of models addressing the more imminent transitional stage wherein legacy and autonomous vehicles share the urban infrastructure. We address this gap by introducing a new policy for stochastic network traffic control involving both classes of vehicles. We conjecture that network links will have dedicated lanes for autonomous vehicles which provide access to traffic intersections and combine traditional green signal phases with autonomous vehicle-restricted signal phases named blue phases. We propose a new pressure-based, decentralized, hybrid network control policy that activates selected movements at intersections based on the solution of mixed-integer linear programs. We prove that the proposed policy is stable, i.e. maximizes network throughput, under conventional travel demand conditions. We conduct numerical experiments to test the proposed policy under varying proportions of autonomous vehicles. Our experiments reveal that considerable trade-offs exist in terms of vehicle-class travel time based on the level of market penetration of autonomous vehicles. Further, we find that the proposed hybrid network control policy improves on traditional green phase traffic signal control for high levels of congestion, thus helping in quantifying the potential benefits of autonomous vehicles in urban networks.

ID SITUATION ASSESSMENT
AB In this paper, we propose a decision-making framework for autonomous driving at road intersections that determines appropriate maneuvers for an autonomous vehicle to navigate an intersection safely and efficiently (regarding making progress), even in the face of violation vehicles-one of the most challenging tasks in the domain of autonomous vehicles. The proposed framework uses a digital map to predict future paths of observed vehicles and then uses the predicted future paths to identify potential threats (vehicles) and collision areas, regardless of whether observed vehicles are obeying traffic rules at the intersection. Next, under an independent and distributed reasoning structure, it systematically, reliably, and robustly assesses the potential threats, even under incomplete and uncertain noise data, by way of a threat measure, Bayesian networks, and time window filtering. It then uses this information to determine appropriate maneuvers for the autonomous vehicle to navigate the intersection safely and efficiently. We have tested and evaluated the proposed framework through in-vehicle testing on a closed urban test road under traffic conditions inclusive of nonviolation and violation vehicles. In-vehicle testing results show the performance of the proposed framework to be sufficiently reliable for autonomous driving at intersections regarding reliability, robustness, safety, and efficiency.

AB The rapid growth of e-commerce and package deliveries across the globe is demanding new solutions to meet customers' desire for more and faster deliveries. New driverless air and ground vehicles are being launched and tested to deliver products or services in the areas of retail, groceries, and healthcare. This research focuses on the efficiency of autonomous (driverless) air and ground delivery vehicles in terms of vehicle-miles, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions. Three types of autonomous vehicle are analyzed: drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), sidewalk autonomous delivery robots (SADRs), and road autonomous delivery robots (RADRs). The CO2 emissions of these autonomous vehicles are compared against emissions from an electric van (e-van), a conventional internal combustion engine van, and driving to a store utilizing electric and conventional vehicles. The impacts of vehicle capacity, range, and time constraints are analyzed as well as the impacts of number of deliveries, service time, area of service, and depot-service area distance. Novel results are found regarding the efficiency of each vehicle type and tradeoffs between driving to a store and store delivery as a function of order size and type of vehicle driven by consumers.

AB To provide a conventional autonomous underwater vehicle with gliding capability, we assume a moving battery and a buoyancy bag installed in a torpedo shaped autonomous underwater vehicle. We develop a mathematical model for the underwater vehicle and derive a stable gliding condition for it. Then an LQR controller is designed to control the zigzag depth of the vehicle, where the derived gliding condition is used as set-points of the control system. For control efforts in the gliding movement, the changes in the center of gravity and the net buoyancy are used, but neither thruster nor rudders are used. By using the gliding capability, the underwater vehicle can move to a farther location silently with less energy consumption and then start operating as a normal autonomous underwater vehicle. We show the feasibility of the proposed method by simulations using Matlab/Simulink.

AB With the development of vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-vehicle technologies, vehicles will be able to communicate with the controller at the intersection. Autonomous driving technology enables vehicles to follow the instructions sent from the controller precisely. Autonomous intersection management considers each vehicle as an agent and coordinates vehicle trajectories to resolve vehicle conflicts inside an intersection. This study proposes an autonomous intersection management algorithm called AIM-ped considering both vehicles and pedestrians which is able to produce the total optimal throughput when combined with max pressure control. This study analyzes the stability properties of the algorithm based on a simpler version of AIM-ped, which is a conflict region model of the autonomous intersection management. To implement the proposed algorithm in simulation, this study combines the max-pressure control with an existing trajectory optimization algorithm to calculate optimal vehicle trajectories. Simulations are conducted to test the effects of pedestrian demand on intersection efficiency. The simulation results show that delays of pedestrians and vehicles are negatively correlated and the proposed algorithm can adapt to the change in the pedestrian demand and activate vehicle movements with conflicting trajectories.

AB Trust is an essential condition for accepting and relying on autonomous vehicles. One of the well-studied factors contributing to trust in automation systems is anthropomorphism. It is expected that anthropomorphism may also enhance trust in the field of autonomous vehicles. A study is presented that investigated the effect of anthropomorphic embodiment for information about the vehicle's maneuvers on people's trust in autonomous vehicles. In a driving simulator experiment deploying a between-subjects design, participants (N=39) were exposed to varying amounts of information displaying upcoming actions of an autonomous vehicle (symbolic information or symbolic + anthropomorphic information). Each group rated trust and liking for the test condition against a reference condition where no information about the upcoming actions was provided through questionnaires. Symbolic + anthropomorphic information resulted in significantly more trust than symbolic information. Through one-sample tests, it was found that ratings for symbolic + anthropomorphic information were significantly different from no information, while symbolic information by itself was not. Ratings for perceived anthropomorphism were positively correlated with trust and liking. It is concluded that anthropomorphizing information may foster the perception of autonomous vehicles as social agents and enhance trust in those vehicles.

AB In order to explore the changes that autonomous vehicles on the road would bring to the current traffic and make full use of the intelligent features of autonomous vehicles, the article defines a self-balancing system of autonomous vehicles. Based on queuing theory and stochastic process, the self-balancing system model with self-balancing characteristics is established to balance the utilization rate of autonomous vehicles under the conditions of ensuring demand and avoiding an uneven distribution of vehicle resources in the road network. The performance indicators of the system are calculated by the MVA (Mean Value Analysis) method. The analysis results show that the self-balancing process could reduce the average waiting time of customers significantly in the system, alleviate the service pressure while ensuring travel demand, fundamentally solve the phenomenon of concentrated idleness after the use of vehicles in the current traffic, maximize the use of the mobile vehicles in the system, and realize the self-balancing of the traffic network while reducing environmental pollution and saving energy.

AB Morning commuting trips commonly involve a number of transportation modes and departure times. This study extends the standard bottleneck model by considering both regular and shared autonomous vehicles with and without parking space constraint, taking into account the travel time-dependent fuel cost that is associated with each vehicle. In this study the parking space constraint has no effect on shared autonomous vehicles and only commuters who share autonomous vehicles exhibit ridesharing behavior, differing from those utilizing regular vehicles. The dynamic departure patterns and endogenous penetration rates associated with shared autonomous vehicles are determined with respect to parking capacity. Analytical results not only provide several important propositions, but also include the optimal solutions for parking capacity and ridesharing occupancy from the perspective of the system optimum in terms of various indicators, under which parking capacity is a binding constraint, and the first shared autonomous vehicle arrives at the bottleneck as the last regular vehicle leaves. This work is expected not only to motivate related research, but also to promote the development of new strategies and methods for allocating a limited number of parking spaces and regulating the travel behavior of commuters in urban areas.

   demonstrate autonomous vehicle reliability?
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE

DT Article
DE Autonomous vehicles; Vehicle automation; Safety; Reliability; Test
   driving; Statistical significance
AB How safe are autonomous vehicles? The answer is critical for determining how autonomous vehicles may shape motor vehicle safety and public health, and for developing sound policies to govern their deployment. One proposed way to assess safety is to test drive autonomous vehicles in real traffic, observe their performance, and make statistical comparisons to human driver performance. This approach is logical, but it is practical? In this paper, we calculate the number of miles of driving that would be needed to provide clear statistical evidence of autonomous vehicle safety. Given that current traffic fatalities and injuries are rare events compared to vehicle miles traveled, we show that fully autonomous vehicles would have to be driven hundreds of millions of miles and sometimes hundreds of billions of miles to demonstrate their reliability in terms of fatalities and injuries. Under even aggressive testing assumptions, existing fleets would take tens and sometimes hundreds of years to drive these miles an impossible proposition if the aim is to demonstrate their performance prior to releasing them on the roads for consumer use. These findings demonstrate that developers of this technology and third-party testers cannot simply drive their way to safety. Instead, they will need to develop innovative methods of demonstrating safety and reliability. And yet, the possibility remains that it will not be possible to establish with certainty the safety of autonomous vehicles. Uncertainty will remain. Therefore, it is imperative that autonomous vehicle regulations are adaptive designed from the outset to evolve with the technology so that society can better harness the benefits and manage the risks of these rapidly evolving and potentially transformative technologies.

AB Autonomous vehicle technology will transform fundamentally urban traffic systems. To better enhance the coming era of connected and autonomous vehicles, effective control strategies that interact wisely with these intelligent vehicles for signalized at-grade intersections are indispensable. Vehicle-to-infrastructure communication technology offers unprecedented clues to reduce the delay at signalized intersections by innovative information-based control strategies. This paper proposes a new dynamic control strategy for signalized intersections with vehicle-to-signal information. The proposed strategy is called periodic vehicle holding (PVH) strategy while the traffic signal can provide information for the vehicles that are approaching an intersection. Under preliminary autonomous vehicle (PAV) environment, left-turning and through-moving vehicles will be sorted based on different information they receive. The paper shows how PVH reorganizes traffic to increase the capacity of an intersection without causing severe spillback to the upstream intersection. Results show that PVH can reduce the delay by approximately 15% at a signalized intersection under relatively high traffic demand.

AB Delphin2 is a hover capable torpedo style Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), developed at the University of Southampton to provide a test bed for research in marine robotics, primarily to enhance the manoeuvring capability of AUVs. This paper describes the mechanical design of the vehicle and its software architecture. The performance of the vehicle is presented as well as preliminary findings from the vehicle's first fully autonomous video survey missions in Lough Erne, Northern Ireland. It is interesting to note that the low-cost of the vehicle and its development using a succession of MEng and PhD students has provided an excellent training environment for specialists in the growing area of marine autonomous vehicles.

AB This paper focuses on safe navigation of an unmanned surface vehicle in proximity to a submerged autonomous underwater vehicle so as to maximise short-range, through-water data transmission while minimising the probability that the two vehicles will accidentally collide. A sliding mode navigation law is developed, and a rigorous proof of optimality of the proposed navigation law is presented. The developed navigation algorithm is relatively computationally simple and easily implementable in real time. Illustrative examples with extensive computer simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Recent technical innovation has driven the evolution of autonomous vehicles. To improve safety as well as on-road vehicular experience, vehicles should be connected with each other or to vehicular networks. Some specification groups, e.g., IEEE and 3GPP, have studied and released vehicular communication requirements and architecture. IEEE's Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment focuses on dedicated and short-range communication, while 3GPP's New Radio V2X supports not only sidelink but also uplink communication. The 3GPP Release 16, which supports 5G New Radio, offers evolved functionalities such as network slice, Network Function Virtualization, and Software-Defined Networking. In this paper, we define and design a vehicular network architecture compliant with 5G core networks to enable and support autonomous driving. As a validation example, a high-definition map needs to contain the context of trajectory for localization and planning of autonomous driving vehicles. We also propose new methods by which autonomous vehicles can push and pull map content efficiently, without causing bottlenecks on the network core. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method via network simulations and our autonomous driving vehicle on the road. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method improves the performance of vehicular content delivery in real-world road environments.

AB The purpose of this paper is to explore an intelligent identification method of autonomous vehicle moving trajectory based on friction nano-generator. This method uses friction nano-generator to obtain energy from the friction between the vehicle tire and the ground, and realizes the perception and recognition of the vehicle motion state. On this basis, through the analysis and processing of the motion state data, an intelligent identification model of the moving trajectory of autonomous vehicles is established to realize the intelligent prediction and control of the driving trajectory of vehicles. Therefore, a large number of vehicle movement state data is collected, and the data are preprocessed and feature extracted, and an intelligent recognition model of vehicle movement trajectory is constructed by machine learning method. Finally, the accuracy and stability of the model are verified by experiments, and the feasibility and practicability of the method are proved. The results show that the intelligent identification method of autonomous vehicle trajectory based on friction nano-generator has high accuracy and practicability. In the field verification environment, the lateral position deviation, heading angle deviation and minimum radius of curvature of the trajectory recognition algorithm for autonomous vehicles are 0.2193m, 10deg and 5.9m, respectively. The lateral deviation of the real vehicle test is kept within 0.5m, and the lateral acceleration is infinitely close to zero. This autonomous path identification is extremely stable. This method can not only realize intelligent prediction and control of vehicle trajectory, but also provide data support for self-learning and optimization of autonomous vehicles.

TI Autonomous Electric Vehicle Sharing System Design
SO JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN
LA English
DT Article
AB Car sharing services promise "green" transportation systems. Two vehicle technologies offer marketable, sustainable sharing: autonomous vehicles (AVs) eliminate customer requirements for car pick-up and return, and battery electric vehicles entail zero emissions. Designing an autonomous electric vehicle (AEV) fleet must account for the relationships among fleet operations, charging station (CS) operations, electric powertrain performance, and consumer demand. This paper presents a system design optimization framework integrating four subsystem problems: fleet size and assignment schedule; number and locations of charging stations; vehicle powertrain requirements; and service fees. We also compare an AEV service and autonomous vehicle (AV) service with gasoline engines. A case study for an autonomous fleet operating in Ann Arbor, MI, is used to examine AEV and AV sharing systems profitability and feasibility for a variety of market scenarios. The results provide practical insights for service system decision makers.

AB Shared mobility can provide access to transportation on a custom basis without vehicle ownership. The advent of connected and automated vehicle technologies can further enhance the potential benefits of shared mobility systems. Although the implications of a system with shared autonomous vehicles have been investigated, the research reported in the literature has exhibited contradictory outcomes. In this paper, we present a summary of the research efforts in shared autonomous vehicle systems that have been reported in the literature to date and discuss potential future research directions.

AB With the rapid development of autonomous driving technology, future road traffic must be composed of autonomous vehicles and artificial vehicles. Although autonomous vehicles have greatly improved road capacity, few studies have involved capacity at signal-controlled intersections, and most of the studies are based on experimental simulation. As such, there is a need to more scientifically analyze the impact of autonomous vehicles on road and intersection capacity. Based on three theories of flow-density relationships, traffic flow equilibrium analysis, and the following model, this paper firstly deduces the flow-density relationship of different vehicle types in a single environment. Secondly, flow-density relationships under different proportions of self-driving vehicles are derived. Through the derivation of these two models, the basic road saturation flow rates under different permeabilities of self-driving vehicles, can be obtained. Based on these results, a revised calculation model for the capacity of signalized intersections with different proportions of autonomous vehicles is proposed, which is essentially to revise the basic saturation flow rate under different permeabilities of autonomous vehicles. By using SUMO 1.15.0 traffic simulation software, the theoretical models are individually tested. The results show that the error rate between the theoretical calculation results and the SUMO simulation results, is less than 16%. This study can provide a basis for the calculation of basic capacity of roads and intersections in a future man-machine hybrid driving environment, and provide theoretical guidance for traffic management and control.

AB Traffic safety plays a crucial role in the development of autonomous vehicles which attracts significant attention in the community. It is a challenge task to ensure autonomous vehicle safety under varied traffic environment interference, especially for airport-like closed-loop conditions. To that aim, we analyze autonomous vehicle safety at typical roadway conditions and traffic state constraints (e.g., car-following state at different speed distributions) by simulating the airport-like traffic conditions. The experimental results suggest that traffic collision risk is in a positive relationship with the speed difference and distance among adjacent vehicles. More specifically, the autonomous vehicle may collide with neighbors when the time to collision (TTC) indicator is lower than 4 s, and vice versa. The research findings can help both research community and practioners obtain additional information for improving traffic safety for autonomous vehicles.

AB Autonomous vehicles are expected to emerge as a main trends in vehicle development over the next decade. To support autonomous vehicles, ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) is required between autonomous vehicles and infrastructure networks, e.g., a fifth-generation (5G) cellular networks. Hence, reliability and latency must be jointly investigated in 5G autonomous vehicular networks. In this paper, utilizing the Euclidean norm theory, we first propose a reliability and latency joint function to evaluate the joint impact of reliability and latency in 5G autonomous vehicular networks. The interactions between reliability and latency are illustrated via Monte Carlo simulations of 5G autonomous vehicular networks. To improve both the reliability and latency performance and implement URLLC, a new network slicing solution that extends from resource slicing to service and function slicing is presented for 5G autonomous vehicular networks. The simulation results indicate that the proposed network slicing solution can improve both the reliability and latency performance and ensure URLLC in 5G autonomous vehicular networks.

AB Understanding the movement of surrounding objects and controlling robot platforms (such as autonomous vehicles and social robots) in a safe way are challenging problems. In the autonomous driving problem, autonomous vehicles must take into account the future behaviors of nearby vehicles and make appropriate controls accordingly. This is the biggest factor that makes autonomous driving problems difficult. In this work, this problem is tackled by combining benefits from both sequence prediction and deep reinforcement learning in a hierarchical manner. The driver's behavior is classified according to the driving style defined by the rules selected in the autonomous driving situation. High-level behavior represents driving style, and the vehicle's movement model is trained to condition itself to high-level behavior. Instead of directly finding low-level controls, we focus on finding high-level behaviors to increase efficiency. For example, if an autonomous vehicle needs to change lanes in certain situations, the high-level behavior "change lanes" is first selected and the corresponding vehicle movement model is used to find the appropriate low-level controls. Reinforcement learning is used to help select the best high-level behavior, and future behaviors of nearby vehicles are jointly reasoned to lead to better understanding of the current situation. The feasibility of the proposed approach is tested in publicly available datasets. The proposed method shows better efficiency and performance compared to existing learning-based control algorithms.

AB Due to instability issues in autonomous vehicles, the risk of danger is increasing rapidly. These problems arise due to unwanted faults in the sensor or the actuator, which decrease vehicle efficiency. In this modern era of autonomous vehicles, the risk factor is also increased as the vehicles have become automatic, so there is a need for a fault-tolerant control system (FTCS) to avoid accidents and reduce the risk factors. This paper presents an active fault-tolerant control (AFTC) for autonomous vehicles with a fuzzy neural network that can autonomously identify any wheel speed problem to avoid instability issues in an autonomous vehicle. MATLAB/Simulink environment was used for simulation experiments and the results demonstrate the stable operation of the wheel speed sensors to avoid accidents in the event of faults in the sensor or actuator if the vehicle becomes unstable. The simulation results establish that the AFTC-based autonomous vehicle using a fuzzy neural network is a highly reliable solution to keep cars stable and avoid accidents. Active FTC and vehicle stability make the system more efficient and reliable, decreasing the chance of instability to a minimal point.

AB In a typical traffic scenario, autonomous vehicles are required to share the road with other road participants, e.g., human driven vehicles, pedestrians, etc. To successfully navigate the traffic, an adaptive robust level-k framework can be used by the autonomous agents to categorize the agents based on their depth of strategic thought and act accordingly. However, mismatch between the vehicle dynamics and its predictions, and improper classification of the agents can lead to undesirable behavior or collision. Robust approaches can handle the uncertainties, however, might result in a conservative behavior of the autonomous vehicle. This paper proposes an adaptive robust decision making strategy for autonomous vehicles to handle model mismatches in the prediction model while utilizing the confidence of the driver behavior to obtain less conservative actions. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated for a lane change maneuver in a highway driving scenario.

AB With the advent of COVID-19, urban transportation has been severely disrupted. We develop a stylized analytical model to study the effect of COVID-19 on the optimal pricing and hygiene level decisions of e-hailing taxi services, which play a crucial role in urban transportation. We analyze whether autonomous vehicles can aid the e-hailing taxi firms to sustain operations during these troubled times. In particular, we provide conditions under which the e-hailing taxi firms should collaborate with an original equipment manufacturer to introduce autonomous vehicles for urban transportation. Owing to the high fixed cost associated with acquiring autonomous vehicles, the e-hailing taxi firms intend to collaborate with an original equipment manufacturer. If the e-hailing taxi firm obtains a significant share from each ride in its collaboration, the hygiene level with autonomous vehicles is always greater than the hygiene level without autonomous vehicles, which is vital during the pandemic. With respect to the question of whether the e-hailing taxi firm should collaborate with the original equipment manufacturer to introduce autonomous vehicles from consumers' viewpoint, we surprisingly find that the consumers are better off when the autonomous vehicles are introduced without collaboration both in the short-run and the long-run. However, given the high fixed cost of introducing autonomous vehicles, the e-hailing taxi firm will find it profitable to collaborate with an original equipment manufacturer if and only if its share from each ride is significant enough.

AB The problem of modelling and control for autonomous vehicles is considered. Mutual interactions among vehicle motion dynamics are evaluated. The mathematical model suitable for describing and simulating the whole motion of autonomous passenger vehicles is proposed. The passenger vehicles are evaluated from many points of view, such as riding comfort, vehicle position, stability, manipulability and soon. The performance of vehicle control in technically is separated into several control items and considered for each item, independently. The mathematical model for steering control of an autonomous vehicle usually has two degrees of freedom, which consider the lateral motion and the yawing motion. The model for suspension dynamics, which is deeply related to riding comfort, also has two degrees of freedom, which consider the bouncing motion and the pitching motion. The above mentioned models are not enough to treat the problem of total motion control of autonomous vehicles. The specifications of tires must also be considered in the whole motion control of vehicles, and they have strong nonlinearity. There are, furthermore, mutual interactions among them, which are inevitably considered for the problem of the whole motion control of autonomous passenger vehicles. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Autonomous surface vehicles are becoming consolidated robotic tools for marine, coastal and inland surveys. Autonomous surface vehicles are usually equipped with electronic instruments to perform remotely controlled or autonomous geo-morphological, biological, chemical, physical analyses and data collection. Actually, well-established solutions provide battery power but the research focuses on introducing a fuel cell to decrease the environmental impact meanwhile increasing the cruising range. In this paper, the design of the Eco-SWAMP, a fuel cell powered autonomous surface vehicle, is presented starting from its battery-powered version, the SWAMP prototype. The experimental power consumption profile of the SWAMP during four missions is analysed to define the primary energy sources ratings of the Eco-SWAMP. After a commercial choice of primary sources, power management algorithms are designed and compared in MATLAB/Simulink environment by simulation results. The proposed procedure can be easily applied to any autonomous marine vehicle. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To drive safely among human drivers, cyclists and pedestrians, autonomous vehicles will need to mimic, or ideally improve upon, humanlike driving. Yet, driving presents us with difficult problems of joint action: 'negotiating' with other users over shared road space. We argue that autonomous driving provides a test case for computational theories of social interaction, with fundamental implications for the development of autonomous vehicles.

AB This article proposes the design and development of a novel custom-built, autonomous scaled multiwheeled vehicle that features an eight-wheel drive and eight-wheel steer system. In addition to the mechanical and electrical design, high-level path planning and low-level vehicle control algorithms are developed and implemented including a two-stage autonomous parking algorithm is developed. A modified position-based visual servoing algorithm is proposed and developed to achieve precise pose correction. The results show significant gains in accuracy and efficiency comparing with an open-source path planner. It is the aim of this work to expand the research of autonomous platforms taking the form of commercial and off-road vehicles using actuated steering and other mechanisms attributed to passenger vehicles. The outcome of this work is a unique autonomous research platform that features independently driven wheels, steering, autonomous navigation, and parking.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have promised to drastically improve the convenience of driving by releasing the burden of drivers and reducing traffic accidents with more precise control. With the fast development of artificial intelligence and significant advancements of the Internet of Things technologies, we have witnessed the steady progress of autonomous driving over the recent years. As promising as it is, the march of autonomous driving technologies also faces new challenges, among which security is the top concern. In this article, we give a systematic study on the security threats surrounding autonomous driving, from the angles of perception, navigation, and control. In addition to the in-depth overview of these threats, we also summarize the corresponding defense strategies. Furthermore, we discuss future research directions about the new security threats, especially those related to deep-learning-based self-driving vehicles. By providing the security guidelines at this early stage, we aim to promote new techniques and designs related to AVs from both academia and industry and boost the development of secure autonomous driving.

AB The state-of-the-art decision and planning approaches for autonomous vehicles have moved away from manually designed systems, instead focusing on the utilisation of large-scale datasets of expert demonstration via Imitation Learning (IL). In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of IL approaches, primarily for the paradigm of end-to-end based systems in autonomous vehicles. We classify the literature into three distinct categories: 1) Behavioural Cloning (BC), 2) Direct Policy Learning (DPL) and 3) Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). For each of these categories, the current state-of-the-art literature is comprehensively reviewed and summarised, with future directions of research identified to facilitate the development of imitation learning based systems for end-to-end autonomous vehicles. Due to the data-intensive nature of deep learning techniques, currently available datasets and simulators for end-to-end autonomous driving are also reviewed.

AB Since the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased the use of personal vehicles in travel, adoption of self-driving autonomous vehicles can radically transform the travel industry. Thus, this study develops and tests a conceptual autonomous vehicle acceptance model that identifies hedonic motivation, trust in autonomous vehicles and social influence as critical determinants of performance expectancy, perceived risk and emotions, which determine travelers' intentions to use autonomous vehicles (AVs) utilizing the Cognitive Appraisal Theory and the Artificially Intelligent Device Use Acceptance model as conceptual frameworks. Findings indicate that trust is the most powerful determinant of performance expectancy and essential to decrease risk perceptions. Furthermore, performance expectancy and hedonic motivation are critical determinants of travelers' positive emotions, which in turn determines the acceptance of AVs. Contribution to theoretical knowledge and implications for practice are provided, and limitations and recommendations for future studies are discussed.

AB Autonomous and connected vehicles are a collection of smart components such as sensors, Radar/Lidar, Electronic Control Units (ECUs), and cameras programmed through voluminous lines of codes, which enable a seamless communication system between the user, vehicle, and infrastructure. The concept of autonomous vehicles is gaining significant traction in the global markets, generating higher revenues, and witnessing high market penetration, thus attracting entrepreneurs to make new and disruptive innovations. However, the underlying technology and communication system of autonomous and connected vehicles are prone to the cybersecurity threats, which circumvent any product that uses sensors, transmits data over the network, and can be controlled through a remote computer or a mobile application. In this article, we attempt to outline the concerns that an aspiring entrepreneur should be aware of before entering into the autonomous vehicle industry, followed by innovative recommendations that can guide addressing the article's issues. The presented recommendations and guidelines are based on the cybersecurity principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Autonomous vehicles require safe motion planning in uncertain environments, which are largely caused by surrounding vehicles. In this paper, a driving environment uncertainty-aware motion planning framework is proposed to lower the risk of position uncertainty of surrounding vehicles with considering the risk of rollover. First, a 4-degree of freedom vehicle dynamics model, and a rollover risk index are introduced. Besides, the uncertainty of surrounding vehicles' position is processed and propagated based on the Extended Kalman Filter method. Then, the uncertainty potential field is established to handle the position uncertainty of autonomous vehicles. In addition, the model predictive controller is designed as the motion planning framework which accounts for the rollover risk, the position uncertainty of the surrounding vehicles, and vehicle dynamic constraints of autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, two edge cases, the cut-in scenario, and merging scenario are designed. Finally, the safety, effectiveness, and real-time performance of the proposed motion planning framework are demonstrated by employing a hardware-in-the-loop experiment bench.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; STABILITY
AB In this article, multitype bend tracking with discontinuous reference paths is researched by a nonlinear terminal-free model predictive control (MPC) with an artificial reference path for an autonomous vehicle. The MPC strategy without terminal penalty and terminal state constraints is proposed to deal with the discontinuous reference paths, which improves solvability on an optimization problem effectively. The artificial reference path is designed to realize replanning and smoothing for multitype bend paths. Both recursive feasibility and stability are discussed for the autonomous vehicle by a lower bound of prediction horizon and a controlled forward invariance set. Effectiveness of the nonlinear terminal-free MPC strategy is shown by experimental results on multitype bend path for the autonomous vehicle.

AB The studies on the autonomous electric vehicle are quite attractive due to fewer human-induced errors and improved safety in recent years. Extensive research has been done on the autonomous steering control of the mobile robot, but study on the on-road autonomous electric vehicle is still limited. This paper proposes a potential field method to achieve the trajectory control of the autonomous electric vehicle with in-wheel motors. Instead of strictly following a desired path, this method can form a steering corridor with a desired tracking error tolerance and the vehicle can be steered smoothly with less control effort. In this paper, the innovative potential filed function is presented first to determine the desired vehicle yaw angle. Then, according to this desired yaw angle, a two-level trajectory controller is proposed to achieve the trajectory control. Simulation results are shown to prove that this suggested trajectory controller can successfully control the vehicle to move within the desired road boundary and improve the handling and stability performance of the vehicle.

AB In the near future, our streets will be populated by myriads of autonomous self-driving vehicles to serve our diverse mobility needs. This will raise the need to coordinate their movements in order to properly handle both access to shared resources (e.g., intersections and parking slots) and the execution of mobility tasks (e.g., platooning and ramp merging). The aim of this article is to provide a global view of the coordination issues and the related solutions in the field of autonomous vehicles. To this end, we firstly introduce the general problems associated with coordination of autonomous vehicles by identifying and framing the key classes of coordination problems. Then, we overview the different approaches that can be adopted to deal with such problems by classifying them in terms of the degree of autonomy in decision making that is left to autonomous vehicles during the coordination process. Finally, we overview some further research challenges to address before autonomous coordinated vehicles can safely hit our streets.

AB Although developing successful autonomous vehicles for practical use is of interest, the establishment of moral autonomous vehicles aligned with human values is also crucial. Prior studies have mainly examined moral decision making in the trolley dilemma of autonomous vehicles, i.e., the driverless dilemma. Relatively little is known, however, about the passenger acceptance (specifically like, use, trust, and communication) of autonomous vehicles in the driverless dilemma. Results of a correlational study (Study 1) and an experimental study (Study 2) found that participants as the passengers were more likely to like, use, trust, and communicate with autonomous vehicles programmed to protect self than protect others and be random in a one-passenger-one-pedestrian scenario representing the one-to-one dilemma. However, in most conditions participants showed no preference for either pro-self, pro-social, or random algorithms in the one-passenger-several-pedestrian scenarios implying the utilitarian dilemma (Studies 1 and 2). The variation of passenger did not affect acceptance of autonomous vehicles in the driverless dilemma (Study 2).

AB With the rapid development of autonomous driving, collision avoidance has attracted attention from both academia and industry. Many collision avoidance strategies have emerged in recent years, but the dynamic and complex nature of driving environment poses a challenge to develop robust collision avoidance algorithms. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a decentralized framework named RACE: Reinforced Cooperative Autonomous Vehicle Collision AvoidancE. Leveraging a hierarchical architecture we develop an algorithm named Co-DDPG to efficiently train autonomous vehicles. Through a security abiding channel, the autonomous vehicles distribute their driving policies. We use the relative distances obtained by the opponent sensors to build the VANET instead of locations, which ensures the vehicle's location privacy. With a leader-follower architecture and parameter distribution, RACE accelerates the learning of optimal policies and efficiently utilizes the remaining resources. We implement the RACE framework in the widely used TORCS simulator and conduct various experiments to measure the performance of RACE. Evaluations show that RACE quickly learns optimal driving policies and effectively avoids collisions. Moreover, RACE also scales smoothly with varying number of participating vehicles. We further compared RACE with existing autonomous driving systems and show that RACE outperforms them by experiencing 65% less collisions in the training process and exhibits improved performance under varying vehicle density.

AB This research seeks to study the path following issue for distributed drive autonomous electric vehicles (DDAEV). In order to improve the tracking accuracy and vehicle stability, coordinated control of tracking deviation compensation and vehicle stability by yaw-moment is proposed. Based on the three degree-of freedom vehicle model, model predictive control is used to calculate the steering angle of front wheels to control the vehicle along the reference path by autonomous steering. In this process, two sliding surfaces whose control targets are tracking deviation and yaw rate deviation are first set, then two sliding surfaces are combined into one coordinated sliding surface with weight coefficients considering the vehicle stability, and finally the yaw-moment is figured out and distributed with the constant torque requirement of the vehicle. Carsim co-simulation with Simulink and Hardware-in-the-Loop experiment are conducted, which shows that compared to autonomous steering control, coordinated control achieves better path following accuracy and vehicle stability for DDAEV under different driving conditions.

AB The rapid progress of science and technology has created favorable conditions for the development of autonomous driverless vehicles. However, the complex conditions in the cities greatly limit the application and promotion of autonomous driving technology. To solve the problem, the underground mine is recommended to apply as a pilot for the promotion of autonomous driverless vehicles. The autonomous vehicles are all connected to the internet to form a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) system. Because of the multi-levels and multi-stopes in underground mines, the key point is to obtain the precise locations of the vehicles in real-time. Therefore, the microseismic monitoring, image recognition technology, artificial intelligence training, and smart sensors are comprehensively utilized, based on the internet of things and cloud computing, to locate the autonomous driverless vehicles. Virtual sources localization and pencil lead break tests are conducted to simulate and eliminate the effectiveness and accuracy of the velocity-free localization method. Virtual sources localization demonstrate that the velocity-free localization method is accurate and reliable. Results of pencil lead break tests show that the average locating errors of X coordinates, Y coordinates, and absolute distance are 0.4318 cm, 0.1136 cm, and 0.5188 cm, respectively. The application and promotion of the autonomous driverless vehicles in underground mines can not only solve the problems of deep mining and reduce the frequent disasters caused by the harsh conditions but also can protect the life and property of the workers, as well as provide technical support for the safe and efficient recycling of deep resources.

AB Autonomous landing of a quadrotor aerial vehicle on a mobile ground vehicle is a key function required for heterogeneous cooperation between air and ground vehicles to extend mission range. Wide angle detection and localization of mobile landing spot can improve reliability and convenience in autonomous landing processes. In this study, we present a hemispherical InfraRed (IR) marker designed and built for reliable detection and autonomous landing from various altitude angles. IR light has higher transmittance and the hemispherical design provides wide angle radiation. We present the fabrication process of the hemispherical marker from a planar flexible film, followed by full system integration on the ground vehicle. The relatively compact (radius: 2.25 cm, height: 2.3 cm) marker is detectable from wide altitude angles (0-180 degrees) and detectable even when covered by thin foreign objects such as fallen leaves or plastic bags. Outdoor experiments with full system integrating autonomous air and ground vehicles demonstrated the feasibility of this approach to autonomous landing for heterogeneous cooperation.

TI Decentralized path planning for cooperating autonomous mobile units

LA English
DT Article
ID FRAMEWORK; VEHICLES
AB In various domains, e.g. robotics or autonomous driving, automated path planning for conflict-free movements of the participating vehicles, i.e. robots, cars or other mobile units is an essential task on the navigation level. Especially in crowded scenarios in which many vehicles share a common operation area together with other static or dynamic obstacles, finding a set of conflict-free paths for all vehicles is a challenging navigation task that is crucial for fully autonomous vehicles. In this work we propose a decentralized path planning algorithm for such scenarios which focuses on the cooperative negotiation of conflict-free paths. The path planning on navigation level is realized with an innovative graph search algorithm based on A* that incorporates dynamic obstacles (e.g. manually operated vehicles and other autonomous mobile units) and enables the autonomous vehicles to change speed. Furthermore, the framework suggests a decentralized approach, in which each vehicle performs its own path planning locally. Communication between the mobile units allows them to cooperatively negotiate conflict-free paths for all autonomous vehicles participating in the framework. The resulting iterative process of calculating new paths and negotiating a feasible solution set for all vehicles is designed to yield a deterministic solution within a finite number of iterations. We furthermore provide promising simulation results for this framework with test scenarios involving many autonomous vehicles and challenging obstacle formations.

ID SITUATION AWARENESS
AB Level 3 autonomous vehicles require conditional autonomous driving in which autonomous and manual driving are alternately performed; whether the driver can resume manual driving within a limited time should be examined. This study investigates whether the demographics and subjective driving tendencies of drivers affect the take-over performance. We measured and analyzed the reengagement and stabilization time after a take-over request from the autonomous driving system to manual driving using a vehicle simulator that supports the driver's take-over mechanism. We discovered that the driver's reengagement and stabilization time correlated with the speeding and wild driving tendency as well as driving workload questionnaires. To verify the efficiency of subjective questionnaire information, we tested whether the driver with slow or fast reengagement and stabilization time can be detected based on machine learning techniques and obtained results. We expect to apply these results to training programs for autonomous vehicles' users and personalized human-vehicle interfaces for future autonomous vehicles.

AB Autonomous driving technology has been regarded as a promising solution to reduce road accidents and traffic congestion, as well as to optimize the usage of fuel and lane. Reliable and highly efficient vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications are essential for commercial autonomous driving vehicles to be on the road before 2020. The current article first presents the concept of heterogeneous vehicular networks (HetVNETs) for autonomous driving, in which an improved protocol stack is proposed to satisfy the communication requirements of not only safety but also non-safety services. We then consider and study in detail several typical scenarios for autonomous driving. In order to tackle the potential challenges raised by the autonomous driving vehicles in HetVNETs, new techniques from transmission to networking are proposed as potential solutions.

AB Currently, the stage of technological development for commercialization of autonomous driving level 3 has been achieved. However, the legal and institutional bases and traffic safety facilities for safe driving on actual roads in autonomous driving mode are insufficient. Therefore, in this study, a measurement method using a camera(monocular or dual) was used to evaluate autonomous vehicles. In addition, integrated scenarios was proposed wherein the scenarios proceeded continuously. The precision of the autonomous vehicle safety evaluation method using cameras was verified via comparisons and analyses with the results of real vehicle tests. As a result of the test, the difference in the average error rate of inter-vehicle distance between the monocular camera and the dual camera was 0.34%. The difference in the average error rate of the distance to the lane was 0.3 to 0.5%, showing similar results. It is judged that it will be possible to compensate for each other's shortcomings if they are used at the same time rather than the independent use of monocular cameras and dual cameras.

AB In 2016, The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported that human error is involved in 94-96% of all motor vehicle crashes. Also in 2016, Bonnefon et al. predicted that autonomous vehicles could eliminate 90% of traffic collisions due to their elimination of human error. However, questions of safety, accessibility, and social equity have arisen after the first pedestrian death by an autonomous vehicle in its testing phase occurred in Tempe, AZ, in 2018. This project analyzes how social equity issues shape the discussion, creation, and implementation of governmental policies and regulations surrounding driverless automobiles in Tempe, using policy and text analysis as well as semi-structured interviews of government officials or residents of Tempe. Informed by the concept of the right to the city and critical legal studies, this research suggests that public policy around autonomous vehicles does create new and expand existing spaces for inequality in Tempe. This is exacerbated by increased awareness of inequality within Arizona's autonomous vehicle regulation scheme and its entire transportation system after the first pedestrian death by autonomous vehicle.

AB In recent years, research concerning autonomous driving has gained momentum to enhance road safety and traffic efficiency. Relevant concepts are being applied to the fields of perception, planning, and control of automated vehicles, to leverage the advantages offered by vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication technology. The emergence of V2X communications increases the level of certainty regarding a vehicle's surroundings and serves as an enabler for autonomous driving. V2X is essential for safe and efficient autonomous driving. Therefore, we need to study the performance of V2X communications to better perform its integration in future autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we describe a testbed V2X infrastructure with components to test the real effectiveness of V2X for autonomous driving using dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) technology. We present our developed intelligent transportation system (ITS) applications, and then, we show their integration within the autonomous vehicle on the one hand and within the infrastructure module on the other hand. Finally, to show the efficiency of this development, we conduct several real-world tests on an end-to-end communication architecture.

AB This study explores the effects of autonomous cars and how they may affect the design of transportation systems. The research investigated the determinants of consumer adoption of autonomous vehicles in Thailand. The research was driven by increasing environmental protection awareness and the need to conserve it through revolutionary technology. The study adopted the extended UTAUT model, where a quantitative method was adopted using primary data from 381 respondents. The results indicated that consumer adoption of autonomous vehicles in Thailand is influenced by performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, environmental benefits, and purchase subsidy. The recommendations developed were that, to enhance the consumers' intention to adopt autonomous vehicles, the concerned stakeholders should improve on aspects, such as the ability to improve job performance, increase productivity, ease of use, flexibility, clarity, and understanding, as well as improve social status. The government should also consider subsidizing autonomous vehicles as this would encourage consumption. A limitation of the study is the generalization of the findings as it is limited to Thailand.

AB The adoption of autonomous vehicles is reported to confer numerous benefits such as improved safety, comfort, resource (i.e. land and energy) use, and environmental protection to a society. Public acceptance is necessary for the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles. Drawing on innovation diffusion, perceived value and trust theories, we developed a theoretical model to identify the latent factors influencing public acceptance of autonomous vehicles and examined their interrelationships. A survey questionnaire was designed and administered to 526 residents in Seoul, Republic of Korea. Thereafter, structural equation modelling was employed to analyse the survey data. The results reveal that the influence of the innovation diffusion attributes (i.e. relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability and observability) on public acceptance is fully mediated by the public's perceived value of autonomous vehicles. Further, the effect of perceived value on public acceptance is partially mediated by the public's trust in autonomous vehicles. This study differentiates from the literature by employing a theory-driven approach to explain autonomous vehicles acceptance. It applies three diverse research paradigms anchoring on innovation diffusion, customer utility and social psychology. In addition, it synthesises the theories and provides a coherent explanation of individuals' cognition process that leads to acceptance. In sum, this study enriches existing theoretical research on the acceptance of autonomous vehicles, offers insights into understanding and managing technology-human interactions and implicates transport policies and practices.

ID SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS; BEHAVIOR; FLOW
AB Autonomous driving has become a popular topic in both industry and academia. Lane-changing is a vital component of autonomous driving behavior in arterial road traffic. Much research has been carried out to investigate discretionary lane changes for autonomous vehicles. However, very little research has been conducted on assisting autonomous vehicles in making mandatory lane changes (MLCs), which is the core of optimal lane-specific route planning for autonomous vehicles. This research aims to determine the best position for providing MLC instruction to autonomous vehicles. In this article, an optimization model is formulated to determine the optimal position at which an instruction to change lanes should be given through automotive navigation systems. First, the distribution of time spent waiting for safe headway to make a lane change is modeled as an exponential distribution. Lane-specific travel times are then calculated for vehicles in various situations by applying traffic shockwave theory and horizontal queuing theory. Finally, the expected travel time is derived for a vehicle receiving a lane change instruction to change lanes at an arbitrary position along the road. The proposed model is validated by a comparison with a simulation model in VISSIM. Additional experiments show that the instruction should be given earlier in the case of denser traffic or higher travel speed in the target lane and that vehicles can save considerable time, if they follow the guidance provided by the proposed model. The proposed model can be applied to guide autonomous vehicles to travel an optimal route.

AB To achieve the announced 2060 carbon neutrality goal, the government of China has recently established its "1 + N" legal and policy framework. However, the emerging autonomous vehicle technology, which is developing rapidly, is not included. Considering the significant potential of autonomous vehicle technology in reducing carbon emissions from the transportation sector, whether and how to integrate it into the current framework can be crucial for China. The existing literature typically does not regard the emission reduction impacts of autonomous vehicles as a major issue, and there are still few studies available aiming to ensure enhancement of emission reduction induced by autonomous vehicle technology from a legal and policy perspective. This article attempts to fill the above research gaps with a three-step research scheme. Specifically, this work begins with a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the possible wide range of factors affecting energy consumption and emissions of autonomous vehicles. Next, an in-depth discussion of the feasibility of incorporating autonomous vehicle technology into the current "1 + N" legal and policy framework is provided. Finally, several recommendations corresponding to these factors are proposed from legal and policy perspectives: (i) adoption of industrial incentives to mitigate research and development costs and risks at the production level and to expand market demand at the consumption level; (ii) priority promotion of the commercialization of autonomous vehicles in the taxi market by filling legal gaps and applying regulatory measures; (iii) development of efficient transportation policies and land use policies. This article provides a systematic and practical scheme for inclusion of autonomous vehicles in China's legal and policy framework to realize the carbon neutrality goal. The proposed recommendations can be referenced for other governments that may face similar challenges and future development of possible uniform rules at the global level.

AB The development of intelligent network and intelligent vehicle technology makes it possible for multi-vehicle cooperative driving. In this study, the multi-vehicle cooperative autonomous parking condition is addressed by establishing a vehicle kinematics model combined with dynamic constraints and endpoint and collision avoidance constraints. The autonomous parking trajectory planning problem is transformed into an optimal control problem. The shortest parking completion time is set as the optimal cost function, and the optimal control problem is discretised by using the Gauss pseudo-spectral method. Then, the non-linear programming problem is solved. Moreover, an initial guess generation strategy is proposed, and the iteration method is used to solve the problem by adding collision avoidance constraints to the collision situation of the vehicle to improve the convergence and robustness of the problem. The simulation model is built in MATLAB/Simulink to simulate multi-vehicle cooperative autonomous parking under different working conditions. The simulation results show that the proposed method can solve the multi-vehicle cooperative autonomous parking trajectory planning problem uniformly and effectively. Compared with the traditional pseudo-spectral method, the proposed method has a faster convergence speed.

AB The trajectory control of autonomous vehicles is an area which has attracted much research recently because it can prevent accidents caused by driver errors and significantly improve road capacity. Overtaking is one of the most complex and challenging manoeuvres for road vehicles and the autonomous control of the vehicle during this manoeuvre can greatly improve vehicle safety. As the innovative four-wheel independent steering (4WIS) and four-wheel independent driving (4WID) electric vehicle can provide redundant control actuators, this study focuses on utilising 4WIS-4WID techniques and vehicle dynamics control to achieve better control of autonomous vehicles. This study first introduces the traditional two-wheel proportional-integral-derivative (PID) steering control and two-wheel sliding mode controller (SMC) driving control for autonomous vehicle control. Then based on these, the four-wheel PID steering controller and four-wheel SMC steering controller are proposed. A four-wheel SMC driving controller and a four-wheel combined yaw rate and longitudinal velocity SMC driving controller are also proposed. Simulation results prove that the best control performance can be achieved when the four-wheel SMC steering controller and four-wheel combined yaw rate and longitudinal velocity SMC driving controller are used together.

AB Autonomous vehicles provide a variety of societal and environmental benefits, however significant technological, legislative, and infrastructural advancements are still required for successful integration of autonomous vehicles into society. The present study applied the Theory of Planned Behaviour to examine the factors driving and impeding autonomous vehicle adoption. Participants were 254 adults (Mage = 37.89, SD = 14.33) who took part in an online survey assessing attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, perceived barriers and intentions to adopt autonomous vehicles. Results indicated that attitudes and both personal and work-related subjective norms were positively associated with adoption intention. An association was not found between perceived behavioural control and adoption intention, and the relationships between psychosocial factors and adoption intention were not found to be moderated by perceived barriers. Concerns regarding the risk of operating errors and fear of equipment or system failure were found to be negatively associated with adoption intention and concerns regarding cost was found to be positively associated with adoption intention. Encouragingly from a safety perspective, it appears that concerns regarding safety are more influential to adoption intention than costs associated with the purchase of the vehicle. The results of this research have important implications for future research and integration of autonomous vehicles into society.

AB Automated systems have been seamlessly integrated into several industries as part of their industrial automation processes. Employing automated systems, such as autonomous vehicles, allows industries to increase productivity, benefit from a wide range of technologies and capabilities, and improve workplace safety. So far, most of the existing systems consider utilizing one type of autonomous vehicle. In this work, we propose a collaboration of different types of unmanned vehicles in maritime offshore scenarios. Providing high capacity, extended coverage, and better quality of services, autonomous collaborative systems can enable emerging maritime use cases, such as remote monitoring and navigation assistance. Motivated by these potential benefits, we propose the deployment of an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) and an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in an autonomous collaborative communication system. Specifically, we design high-speed, directional communication links between a terrestrial control station and the two unmanned vehicles. Using measurement and simulation results, we evaluate the performance of the designed links in different communication scenarios and we show the benefits of employing multiple autonomous vehicles in the proposed communication system.

AB Recently, technological advancements in autonomous vehicle development have continued to accelerate. In this paper, we propose a lateral controller and navigation algorithm for autonomous vehicles based on the Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS), core technology of autonomous vehicles. In this study, an H-infinity (H-a) controller was designed lateral controller to ensure nominal safety and robustness against noise, external disturbances and structural and non-structural errors in vehicle modeling. Meanwhile, the "pure pursuit" approach which geometrically follows a path was employed as a path-tracking technique for the proposed navigation algorithm. A vehicle modeling simulation was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method using a twodegrees- of-freedom linear model. The lateral H-a controller and navigation algorithm were applied to an actual vehicle, Their performances were evaluated by comparing the path tracking error at various speeds of autonomous vehicles with that of the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller.

AB This article presents a state-of-the-art literature review to understand people's perceptions and opinions of Autonomous Vehicles and the factors that influence their adoption. A strategic literature search was conducted to select articles for this review. Most of the articles were published since 2015 and they used a household questionnaire survey to collect data. Mostly, they used statistical and econometric methods to evaluate the factors that affect people's intentions to adopt Autonomous Vehicles. The results show that psychological factors often appear as the most important internal factors of people's willingness to adopt Autonomous Vehicles. Additionally, other internal factors such as the socioeconomic profile of individuals and their household, and knowledge and familiarity with Autonomous Vehicle technologies would affect adoption tendencies. User attributes also indirectly affect adoption of Autonomous Vehicles by influencing the psychological factors of users. We identify several critical external factors such as opportunities (e.g., safety and security, low congestion, energy use) and challenges (e.g., system failures, privacy breaches, and legal issues), while another influential group includes transportation factors (e.g., travel mode, distance, and time), urban form (e.g., urban/rural, density, land use diversity), affinity to new technology, and the institutional regulatory environment. We discuss some recommendations for policy makers, auto industries, and private stakeholders to formulate policies and strategies to increase the market share of Autonomous Vehicles. Finally, we identify some limitations of previous studies and provide a blueprint for future research on Autonomous Vehicle adoption.

AB This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a virtual target-based overtaking decision, motion planning, and control algorithm for autonomous vehicles. Both driver acceptance and safety, when surrounded by other vehicles, must be considered during autonomous overtaking. These are considered through safe distance based on human driving behavior. Since all vehicles cannot be equipped with a vehicle to vehicle communications at present, autonomous vehicles should perceive the surrounding environment based on local sensors. In this paper, virtual targets are devised to cope with the limitation of cognitive range. A probabilistic prediction is adopted to enhance safety, given the potential behavior of surrounding vehicles. Then, decision-making and motion planning has been designed based on the probabilistic prediction-based safe distance, which could achieve safety performance without a heavy computational burden. The algorithm has considered the decision rules that drivers use when overtaking. For this purpose, concepts of target space, demand, and possibility for lane change are devised. In this paper, three driving modes are developed for active overtaking. The desired driving mode is decided for safe and efficient overtaking. To obtain desired states and constraints, intuitive motion planning is conducted. A stochastic model predictive control has been adopted to determine vehicle control inputs. The proposed autonomous overtaking algorithm has been evaluated through simulation, which reveals the effectiveness of virtual targets. Also, the proposed algorithm has been successfully implemented on an autonomous vehicle and evaluated via real-world driving tests. Safe and comfortable overtaking driving has been demonstrated using a test vehicle.

AB This paper addresses the trajectory planning problem for autonomous vehicles in traffic. We build a stochastic Markov decision process (MDP) model to represent the behaviors of the vehicles. This MDP model takes into account the road geometry and is able to reproduce more diverse driving styles. We introduce a new concept, namely, the "dynamic cell," to dynamically modify the state of the traffic according to different vehicle velocities, driver intents (signals), and the sizes of the surrounding vehicles (i.e., truck, sedan, and so on). We then use Bezier curves to plan smooth paths for lane switching. The maximum curvature of the path is enforced via certain design parameters. By designing suitable reward functions, different desired driving styles of the intelligent vehicle can be achieved by solving a reinforcement learning problem. The desired driving behaviors (i.e., autonomous highway overtaking) are demonstrated with an in-house developed traffic simulator.

AB It is anticipated that in the near future, the penetration rate of vehicles with some autonomous capabilities (e.g., adaptive cruise control, lane following, full automation, etc.) will increase on roadways. This work investigates the potential reduction of vehicular emissions caused by the whole traffic stream, when a small number of autonomous vehicles (e.g., 5% of the vehicle fleet) are designed to stabilize the traffic flow and dampen stop-and-go waves. To demonstrate this, vehicle velocity and acceleration data are collected from a series of field experiments that use a single autonomous-capable vehicle to dampen traffic waves on a circular ring road with 20-21 human-piloted vehicles. From the experimental data, vehicle emissions (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen oxides) are estimated using the MOVES emissions model. This work finds that vehicle emissions of the entire fleet may be reduced by between 15% (for carbon dioxide) and 73% (for nitrogen oxides) when stop-and-go waves are reduced or eliminated by the dampening action of the autonomous vehicle in the flow of human drivers. This is possible if a small fraction (similar to 5%) of vehicles are autonomous and designed to actively dampen traffic waves. However, these reductions in emissions apply to driving conditions under which stop-and-go waves are present. Less significant reductions in emissions may be realized from a deployment of AVs in a broader range of traffic conditions.

AB The current literature on public perceptions of autonomous vehicles focuses on potential users and the target market. However, autonomous vehicles need to operate in a mixed traffic condition, and it is essential to consider the perceptions of road users, especially vulnerable road users. This paper builds explicitly on the limitations of previous studies that did not include a wide range of road users, especially vulnerable road users who often receive less priority. Therefore, this paper considers the perceptions of vulnerable road users towards sharing roads with autonomous vehicles. The data were collected from 795 people. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and random forests are used to select the most influential independent variables. Then, a decision tree-based model is used to explore the effects of the selected most effective variables on the respondents who approve the use of public streets as a proving ground for autonomous vehicles. The results show that the effect of autonomous vehicles on traffic injuries and fatalities, being safe to share the road with autonomous vehicles, the Elaine Herzberg accident and its outcome, and maximum speed when operating in autonomous are the most influential variables. The results can be used by authorities, companies, policymakers, planners, and other stakeholders.

AB Outstanding steps towards intelligent transportation systems with autonomous vehicles have been taken in the past few years. Nevertheless, the safety issue in autonomous vehicles is critical and remains to be fully solved. Sensor data provide information about the internal status of the system and the impact of its external environment, where the occurrence of sensor data anomalies indicates the existence of potential safety risks. Therefore, in this work, a taxonomy for potential sensor data anomaly sources from the perspective of road vehicle safety is proposed, motivated by the lack of a unified comprehensive taxonomy of sensor data anomaly identification for autonomous vehicles. In this context, sources are divided into; 1) fault or failure of the components or subsystems; 2) failure of the adaptability to the external environment; 3) cyber-attacks; and 4) faults or design deficiencies of sensors. Based on the taxonomy proposed, related works, and in particular, countermeasures for the four potential sources of sensor data anomalies in autonomous vehicles are then reviewed. In the context of providing a comprehensive discussion, other taxonomies of potential sources causing sensor data anomalies for autonomous vehicles and the issue of interpretability of sensor data anomalies are also discussed, providing insight into the strengths of the proposed taxonomy.

AB This study examines how favourable attitudes towards autonomous vehicle technology and automation-induced complacency relate to unsafe driving behaviours using semi-autonomous vehicles as an exemplar. The sample consisted of 441 college students and a repeated measures design was used to examine the relationships between psychological attitudes and susceptibility to risky driving behaviours across three scenarios. Linear regression analyses were conducted for hypothesis testing. Study 1 showed that favourable attitudes towards autonomous vehicle technologies were not significantly associated with susceptibility to risky driving behaviours. Study 2 replicated this finding, however, automation-induced complacency was significantly associated with susceptibility to risky driving behaviours. Additionally, evidence was found for the incremental validity of automation-induced complacency over favourable attitudes towards autonomous features. In distinguishing favourable attitudes towards autonomous features from automation-induced complacency, future research and policy-making can separately address these constructs for the promotion of traffic safety and policy-making. Practitioner summary: We aimed to assess inclinations towards risky driving behaviours in semi-autonomous vehicles. Using vignettes, we found that favourable attitudes towards autonomous vehicles are not associated with risky behaviours, but automation-induced complacency was. Our findings suggest policies like educational programs can be implemented to prevent misuse of semi-autonomous vehicles.

AB Autonomous vehicles are sought to be integral in smart cities. However, should those vehicles be equipped with high-cost sensors? Would the use of low-cost sensors on autonomous vehicles makes them effectively workable over a long period of time? The question of how effective low-cost sensors can be for the proper functionality of autonomous vehicles is addressed in this paper. We have built a small-size prototype of an autonomous vehicle, where low-cost sensors were employed. Then, we have done experimental tests on the vehicle and its sensors, with the features of object detection and response through collision avoidance, traffic lights detection and adequate response, lane detection and lane-keeping response, and end of route detection and stopping response. Our experimental results show that low-cost sensors perform well with carefully-prepared road conditions, but they can be a challenge for operation on real-world roads. Based on our testing experience and on the faced challenges, we share our findings as well as our recommendations with the research community. Therefore, this paper provides insights toward reliable and workable real-world low-cost autonomous vehicles.

AB Current autonomous driving relies on sensors that can only observe the vehicles in the line of sight (LoS), rendering the driving decisions to hinge on the physical movements of the visible vehicles in proximity. Furthermore, it is practically impossible to sense their intentions. Consequently, driving decisions that account for non-LoS vehicles and the intentions of neighbouring vehicles are hard to achieve. This Letter shows the potential of combining vehicular communication with autonomous driving. In particular, the authors show how vehicular communication can assist autonomous driving decision, with a case of a controller that mimics the flocking behaviours in nature.

AB In this work, the problem of path planning for an autonomous vehicle that moves on a freeway is considered. The most common approaches that are used to address this problem are based on optimal control methods, which make assumptions about the model of the environment and the system dynamics. On the contrary, this work proposes the development of a driving policy based on reinforcement learning. In this way, the proposed driving policy makes minimal or no assumptions about the environment, since a priori knowledge about the system dynamics is not required. Driving scenarios where the road is occupied both by autonomous and manual driving vehicles are considered. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is one of the first approaches that propose a reinforcement learning driving policy for mixed driving environments. The derived reinforcement learning policy, firstly, is compared against an optimal policy derived via dynamic programming, and, secondly, its efficiency is evaluated under realistic scenarios generated by the established SUMO microscopic traffic flow simulator. Finally, some initial results regarding the effect of autonomous vehicles' behaviour on the overall traffic flow are presented.

AB Safety is the most important requirement for autonomous vehicles; hence, the ultimate challenge of designing an edge computing ecosystem for autonomous vehicles is to deliver enough computing power, redundancy, and security so as to guarantee the safety of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, autonomous driving systems are extremely complex; they tightly integrate many technologies, including sensing, localization, perception, decision making, as well as the smooth interactions with cloud platforms for high-definition (HD) map generation and data storage. These complexities impose numerous challenges for the design of autonomous driving edge computing systems. First, edge computing systems for autonomous driving need to process an enormous amount of data in real time, and often the incoming data from different sensors are highly heterogeneous. Since autonomous driving edge computing systems are mobile, they often have very strict energy consumption restrictions. Thus, it is imperative to deliver sufficient computing power with reasonable energy consumption, to guarantee the safety of autonomous vehicles, even at high speed. Second, in addition to the edge system design, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) provides redundancy for autonomous driving workloads and alleviates stringent performance and energy constraints on the edge side. With V2X, more research is required to define how vehicles cooperate with each other and the infrastructure. Last, safety cannot be guaranteed when security is compromised. Thus, protecting autonomous driving edge computing systems against attacks at different layers of the sensing and computing stack is of paramount concern. In this paper, we review state-of-the-art approaches in these areas as well as explore potential solutions to address these challenges.

AB The Mechatronics and Dynamic Modelling Laboratory of the Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Florence, as a partner of THESAURUS (Italian acronym for TecnicHe per l'Esplorazione Sottomarina Archeologica mediante l'Utilizzo di Robot aUtonomi in Sciami') project, has developed an innovative low-cost, multirole autonomous underwater vehicle, called Tifone. This article deals with the adopted methodologies for the autonomous underwater vehicle design: in particular, the main focus of this study is related to its propulsion system. According to the expected performances and requirements of THESAURUS project, the vehicle has to maintain good autonomy and efficiency (typical features of an autonomous underwater vehicle), with high manoeuvrability and hovering capabilities, which are more common of remotely operated vehicles. Moreover, cooperative underwater exploration and surveillance involve the use of a swarm of vehicles. In particular, the optimization of costs versus benefits is achieved through the design of a fleet of three multirole vehicles. Each autonomous underwater vehicle has five controlled degrees of freedom, thanks to four thrusters and two propellers: in this article, the preliminary design criteria concerning the vehicle and the design and testing of its actuation system are described.

AB While increasing number of studies are using agent-based models to study the potential environmental, economic, and social impacts of shared autonomous vehicles, the idle vehicle dispatching in these models is often simplified to heuristic rules. Because the system performance of an autonomous taxi fleet can be significantly affected by the vehicle dispatching algorithm, refining the vehicle dispatching can help us better evaluate the potential benefits and impacts of shared autonomous vehicle systems. The recent development of reinforcement-learning-based vehicle dispatching algorithms provides opportunities to improve autonomous vehicle system modeling with efficient and scalable vehicle dispatching. This study integrates a reinforcement learning algorithm into to an agent-based simulation model of a ride hailing system. Using an autonomous taxi fleet in New York City as a case study, we compared the system performance of using the proposed Deep Q-Network (DQN) method for dispatching decision with common rule-based and heuristic dispatch algorithms from relevant literatures. The results show that (1) DQN dispatches vehicles more conservatively (with less dispatching activities and distances) but achieved similar (slightly lower) rider service level with proactive dispatch methods; and (2) DQN outperformed all other dispatch methods evaluated in this study with significantly higher dispatch efficiency, as measured by the ratio of the number of extra riders served due to dispatching to the extra fleet dispatch distance.

AB The purpose of this paper is to describe solutions to yet unsolved problems of autonomous vehicles and infrastructure communication via the Internet of Things (IoT). The paper, in the form of a conceptual article, intentionally does not contain research elements, as we plan to conduct simulations in future papers. Each of the many forms of communication between vehicles and infrastructure (V2I) or vice versa offers different possibilities. Here, we describe typical situations and challenges related to the introduction of autonomous vehicles in traffic. An investment in V2I may be necessary to keep the traffic of autonomous vehicles safe, smooth, and energy efficient. Based on the review of existing solutions, we propose several ideas, key elements, algorithms, and hardware. Merely detecting the road infrastructure may not be enough. It is also necessary to consider a new form of travel called the Personal Transporter (PT). The introduction of new systems and solutions offers benefits for both autonomous vehicles and vehicles with a low degree of automation.

AB Autonomous driving and its acceptance are becoming increasingly important in psychological research as the application of autonomous functions and artificial intelligence in vehicles increases. In this context, potential users are increasingly considered, which is the basis for the successful establishment and use of autonomous vehicles. Numerous studies show an association between personality variables and the acceptance of autonomous vehicles. This makes it more relevant to identify potential user profiles to adapt autonomous vehicles to the potential user and the needs of the potential user groups to marketing them effectively. Our study, therefore, addressed the identification of personality profiles for potential users of autonomous vehicles (AVs). A sample of 388 subjects answered questions about their intention to use autonomous buses, their sociodemographics, and various personality variables. Latent Profile Analysis was used to identify four personality profiles that differed significantly from each other in their willingness to use AVs. In total, potential users with lower anxiety and increased self-confidence were more open toward AVs. Technology affinity as a trait also contributes to the differentiation of potential user profiles and AV acceptance. The profile solutions and the correlations with the intention to use proved to be replicable in cross validation analyses.

AB It is an essential issue for autonomous vehicles to keep driving safety while sharing spaces with other road users, especially moving pedestrians. An ideal trajectory planning of autonomous vehicles should be collision-free and feasible for the vehicles to execute. Previous efforts on trajectory planning mainly focused on traditional roads, and the research into pedestrian-vehicle interaction in shared spaces were still insufficient. This study proposed a prediction-planning collaboration method for autonomous vehicles to avoid collisions with moving pedestrians by predicting their motions, and generate feasible trajectories based on Frenet coordinate in shared spaces. Pre-crash scenarios were designed based on reported crashes, and simulations were performed to evaluate the collision avoidance performances of the proposed method. Meanwhile, validations with real world dataset were conducted to verify the practicability of the proposed framework in real driving environment. The results indicated that the proposed prediction-planning collaboration method could effectively predict the motions of moving pedestrians and ensure the safe interactions between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians in shared spaces.

DE autonomous vehicles; motion-planning; trajectory design
AB In the development of autonomous vehicles, the design of real-time motion-planning is a crucial problem. The computation of the vehicle trajectory requires the consideration of safety, dynamic and comfort aspects. Moreover, the prediction of the vehicle motion in the surroundings and the real-time planning of the autonomous vehicle trajectory can be complex tasks. The goal of this paper is to present low-complexity motion-planning for overtaking scenarios in parallel traffic. The developed method is based on the generation of a graph, which contains feasible vehicle trajectories. The reduction of the complexity in the real-time computation is achieved through the reduction of the graph with clustering. In the motion-planning algorithm, the predicted motion of the surrounding vehicles is taken into consideration. The prediction algorithm is based on density functions of the surrounding vehicle motion, which are developed through real measurements. The resulted motion-planning algorithm is able to guarantee a safe and comfortable trajectory for the autonomous vehicle. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated through simulation examples using a high-fidelity vehicle dynamic simulator.

AB A preestablished test and evaluation system will benefit the development of autonomous ground vehicles. This paper proposes a design method for a scientific and comprehensive test and evaluation system for autonomous ground vehicles competitions. It can better guide and regulate the development of China's autonomous ground vehicles. The test and evaluation system includes the test contents, the test environment, the test methods, and the evaluation methods. Using a hierarchical design approach, the test content is designed to be stage by stage, moving from simplicity to complexity and from individual modules to the entire vehicle. The hierarchical test environment is established according to the levels of test content. The test method based on multilevel platforms and sensors is put forward to ensure the accuracy of test results. A fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method combined with analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used for the comprehensive evaluation which can quantitatively evaluate the individual module and the overall technical performance of autonomous ground vehicles. The proposed test and evaluation system has been successfully applied to real autonomous ground vehicle competitions.

AB Autonomous vehicles, and the larger socio-technical systems that they are a part of are likely to have a deep and lasting impact on our societies. Trust is a key value that will play a role in the development of autonomous driving systems. This paper suggests that trust of autonomous driving systems will impact the ways that these systems are taken up, the norms and laws that guide them and the design of the systems themselves. Further to this, in order to have autonomous driving systems that are worthy of our trust, we need a superstructure of oversight and a process that designs trust into these systems from the outset. Rather than banning or avoiding all autonomous vehicles should a tragedy occur, despite these systems having some level of risk, we want resilient systems that can survive tragedies, and indeed, improve from them. I will argue that trust plays a role in developing these resilient systems.

DE Autonomous vehicles; Coordination; Auction
AB Autonomous vehicles are appearing in our streets, and will soon populate our transportation infrastructures, which must be equipped with appropriate sensors and actuators in order to manage vehicles in a fruitful way. Besides the infrastructures, appropriate algorithms must be defined in order to coordinate the vehicles and to enable them to exploit the resources in a fair yet effective way. In the immediate future, autonomous vehicles must coexist human-driven vehicles, and this transitory scenario poses several challenges in coordinating both kinds to exploit street resources. One of these resources, whose management is quite challenging, is represented by intersections: vehicles come and aim at passing the intersection, often as soon as possible, but they must compete with other vehicles having the same aim. A possible approach that has been used in literature to this problem uses auction based mechanisms. In this paper, we place ourselves in the above-mentioned transitory scenario in which both human-driven and autonomous vehicles will compete to cross intersections, and we investigate the effectiveness of auction-based mechanism to coordinate vehicles at intersections. We devise some simple auction policies, and assume vehicle coordination strategies that are suitable also for human drivers. Our results lead us to believe that, under these assumptions, simple auction mechanisms do not introduce advantages for what concern traveling times as they do in the case of exclusively autonomous vehicles.

AB This paper presents a two-stage cooperative path planner for multiple autonomous underwater vehicles operating in dynamic environment. In case of static environment, global Legendre pseudospectral method is employed for collision-free paths of vehicles for the purpose of minimum time consumption and simultaneous arrival. Moreover, in order to keep the multiple autonomous underwater vehicles safe from collisions on the path segments connecting two adjacent control nodes, an adaptive intermediate knots insertion algorithm is introduced. In the on-line planning stage, the local re-planning strategy aims at avoiding collisions with unexpected dynamic obstacles by two consecutive avoidance maneuvers, and the differential flatness property of autonomous underwater vehicle is utilized, which can help the vehicles react fast enough to avoid moving obstacles.

AB This paper studies how autonomous vehicles (AVs) influence future traffic and energy consumption when adopting various route guidance strategies, which can be divided into global information strategies and local information strategies according to the scope of information collection. A mixed traffic flow model is established. Then, an autonomous vehicle model is improved to investigate the impact of six route guidance strategies. The selected strategies are specifically evaluated in a double-route scenario, considering both single-exit and dual-exit configurations. Three indicators are chosen to evaluate traffic efficiency, including traffic flow, average speed and quantity of vehicles. Consumption per unit flux is the indicator of energy consumption level. Simulation results show that autonomous vehicles can improve traffic efficiency and reduce energy consumption.

AB To date, a large body of the literature has looked into the problem of autonomous intersection crossings facilitated by Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Nevertheless, existing approaches assume that CAVs know their exact location and system state. This work presents a novel framework that allows for an optimized intersection management, which considers vehicle location uncertainties for linear-Gaussian systems. Building upon the proposed framework, a family of 0-1 integer linear programming optimizations are presented that can set, sequentially or simultaneously, the acceleration profiles of all vehicles in the intersection. Extensive simulation results are presented, proving that the proposed framework represents a real-time near-optimal approach that maximizes intersection throughput with probabilistic collision avoidance guarantees.

ID GENERATION
AB In this paper, the global optimal path planning of an autonomous vehicle for overtaking a moving obstacle is proposed. In this study, the autonomous vehicle overtakes a moving vehicle by performing a double lane-change maneuver after detecting it in a proper distance ahead. The optimal path of vehicle for performing the lane-change maneuver is generated by a path planning program in which the sum of lateral deviation of the vehicle from a reference path and the rate of steering angle become minimum while the lateral acceleration of vehicle does not exceed a safe limit value. A nonlinear optimal control theory with the lateral vehicle dynamics equations and inequality constraint of lateral acceleration are used to generate the path. The indirect approach for solving the optimal control problem is used by applying the calculus of variation and the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle to obtain first-order necessary conditions for optimality. The optimal path is generated as a global optimal solution and can be used as the benchmark of the path generated by the local motion planning of autonomous vehicles. A full nonlinear vehicle model in CarSim software is used for path following simulation by importing path data from the MATLAB code. The simulation results show that the generated path for the autonomous vehicle satisfies all vehicle dynamics constraints and hence is a suitable overtaking path for the following vehicle.

AB In recent days, the smart industry concept is becoming more prominent in industrial autonomous vehicle navigation systems. The need for service reliability and industrial management has led to various developing ideas in the industrial environment. Autonomous vehicles are commonly used for logistics and demand-aware migration of goods within the industry. In this article, the self-controlled touring and movement (SCTM) method is proposed to design, plan, and execute autonomous vehicle movements. The goal of this method is to improve the output of vehicle movements under controlled operating errors. For this purpose, the user requirement and outputs are identified and estimated beforehand for providing effective vehicle navigation plans. This error, balancing with the demands and outputs, is performed using classification learning wherein the changes of the vehicle's movements are frequently updated. Further changes are performed within the completion of the tour plan for retaining operational efficiency of the autonomous vehicle. This method is verified using the following metrics: percent of changes, operating error, delay, balancing factor, and response. The proposed SCTM reduces error by 9.73% and delay by 17.1%, whereas it increases the balancing factor by 8.3% for different tour instances.

AB The success of deep neural networks (DNNs) has led to its increased deployment in various real-world applications, which provides strong incentives for motivated adversaries to manipulate the results and models generated by these algorithms. We present an automated, physically-realizable, dynamic adversarial attack to compromise an end-to-end trained DNN controlled autonomous vehicle. The attack is initiated by installing a billboard displaying videos on the roadside to incoming DNN controlled vehicles so that the vehicle tracks an adversary customized trajectory. The billboard contains an integrated camera to enable estimation of the pose of the approaching vehicle. The dynamic billboard images (i.e., a video) continuously adapt to the vehicle's relative pose with respect to the billboard while being robust to variations in lighting, view angle, and weather. The attack's effectiveness is shown on a recently developed off-the-shelf high-fidelity simulator, CARLA, for autonomous vehicles. CARLA utilizes an end-to-end learning-based autonomous navigation system. The proposed approach is applicable to other end-to-end trained autonomous cyber-physical systems.

AB This article investigates the adaptive resilient event-triggered control for rear-wheel-drive autonomous (RWDA) vehicles based on an iterative single critic learning framework, which can effectively balance the frequency/changes in adjusting the vehicle's control during the running process. According to the kinematic equation of RWDA vehicles and the desired trajectory, the tracking error system during the autonomous driving process is first built, where the denial-of-service (DoS) attacking signals are injected into the networked communication and transmission. Combining the event-triggered sampling mechanism and iterative single critic learning framework, a new event-triggered condition is developed for the adaptive resilient control algorithm, and the novel utility function design is considered for driving the autonomous vehicle, where the control input can be guaranteed into an applicable saturated bound. Finally, we apply the new adaptive resilient control scheme to a case of driving the RWDA vehicles, and the simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and practicality successfully.

AB Merging is, in general, a challenging task for both human drivers and autonomous vehicles, especially in dense traffic, because the merging vehicle typically needs to interact with other vehicles to identify or create a gap and safely merge into. In this paper, we consider the problem of autonomous vehicle control for forced merge scenarios. We propose a novel game-theoretic controller, called the Leader-Follower Game Controller (LFGC), in which the interactions between the autonomous ego vehicle and other vehicles with a priori uncertain driving intentions is modeled as a partially observable leader-follower game. The LFGC estimates the other vehicles' intentions online based on observed trajectories, and then predicts their future trajectories and plans the ego vehicle's own trajectory using Model Predictive Control (MPC) to simultaneously achieve probabilistically guaranteed safety and merging objectives. To verify the performance of LFGC, we test it in simulations and with the NGSIM data, where the LFGC demonstrates a high success rate of 97.5% in merging.

AB This article examines the "sensor work" carried out in the development of autonomous vehicles which, without sensor data, would not and arguably still do not, have the capacity to decide on where, and how, to drive. I begin by discussing three aspects of sensor technologies considered to be the foundation for sensor work being carried out in autonomous vehicle settings, namely the distribution, processing, and sourcing of sensor technologies and sensor data. The article considers how that much of this sensor work aids not only the operation of autonomous vehicles but also their necessary "interoperation." In studying four specific sensing methods from an operational perspective, I consider how the interoperation between sensing devices and subsequent algorithmic, object-recognition, and motion planning procedures is fundamental to the development of autonomous vehicles.

AB The US Army must update its vehicle fleet to be better equipped for potential future military conflicts in northern climates (US Army, 2017). This process involves considering manned, optionally manned, and unmanned vehicles as viable options in the future. Optionally manned and unmanned vehicles in the armed forces have substantial benefits because they can operate without direct driver input or are able to perform missions deemed too dangerous for troops. Optionally manned vehicles allow the driver to shift some, or all, focus away from the task of driving the vehicle. In some cases, these autonomous vehicles may perform better than a human driver by rapidly sensing and reacting to terrain changes. Onboard sensing and decision making are equally applicable to both fully autonomous and teleoperated vehicles. This work will focus on the terrain sensing, waypoint navigation, and teleoperation potential of an optionally manned or unmanned vehicle. Results from a vehicle demonstration on two different terrain conditions will provide the basis for additional terrain sensing and autonomous vehicle development work in the coming year.

AB Vehicle localization and mobility tracking are important tasks in autonomous driving. Traditional methods either have insufficient accuracy or rely on additional facilities to reach the desired accuracy for autonomous driving. In this paper, a multi-sensor multi-vehicle localization and mobility tracking framework is developed for autonomous vehicles equipped with GPS, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and an integrated sensing system. Our algorithm fuse the information from local onboard sensors as well as the observations of other vehicles or existing intelligent transportation system infrastructure such as road side units (RSU) to improve the precision and stability of localization and mobility tracking. Specifically, this framework incorporates the dynamic model of vehicles to achieve better localization and tracking performance. The communication delays during the information sharing process are explicitly taken into account in our algorithm development. Simulations manifest that not only the accuracy of localization and mobility tracking could be greatly enhanced in general, but also the robustness can be guaranteed under circumstances where traditional localization and tracking devices fail.

AB Local path planning is a key task for the motion planners of autonomous vehicles since it commands the vehicle across its environment while avoiding any obstacles. To perform this task, the local path planner generates a trajectory and a velocity profile, which are then sent to the vehicle's actuators. This paper proposes a new local path planner for autonomous vehicles based on the Attractor Dynamic Approach (ADA), which was inspired by the behavior of movement of living beings, along with an algorithm that takes into account four acceleration policies, the ST dynamic vehicle model, and several constraints regarding the comfort and security. The original functions that define the ADA were modified in order to adapt it to the non-holonomic vehicle's constraints and to improve its response when an impact scenario is detected. The present approach is validated in a well-known simulator for autonomous vehicles under three representative cases of study where the vehicle was capable of generating local paths that ensure the security of the vehicle in such cases. The results show that the approach proposed in this paper is a promising tool for the local path planning of autonomous vehicles since it is able to generate trajectories that are both safe and efficient.

AB Automotive/transportation sector is undergoing a phenomenal course of rapid, multifaceted change. This transformation is enabled by similar factors that are driving advancements in the Internet of Things including increased computing resources and ubiquitous connectivity. In near future, Connected and Autonomous Electric Vehicle (CAEV) will evolve in ways that will have a major impact on transportation infrastructure, automotive industries, as well as vehicle ownership. As the number of connected vehicles continues to grow, the conventional Vehicle Ad hoc Networks are now evolving as the Internet of Vehicle (IoV). The IoV may be referred as a platform that enables the exchange of information between the vehicle and its surroundings through various communication media. In case of Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV), it may be referred to Internet of CAV. This paper presents the implementation of CAEV toward an automated driving, and testbeds of CAEV use cases including automated charging management services and CAEV taxi services. The preliminary analysis shows that the effectual implementation of the CAEV use cases.

AB With the advent of autonomous vehicles, in particular its adaptability to harsh conditions, the research and development of autonomous vehicles attract significant attention by not only academia but also practitioners. Due to the high risk, high cost, and difficulty to test autonomous vehicles under harsh conditions, the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) scaled platform has been proposed as it is a safe, inexpensive, and effective test method. This platform system consists of scaled autonomous vehicle, scaled roadway, monitoring center, transmission device, positioning device, and computers. This paper uses a case of the development process of tracking control for high-speed U-turn to build the tracking control function. Further, a simplified vehicle dynamics model and a trajectory tracking algorithm have been considered to build the simulation test. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the HIL scaled platform.

AB This paper addresses a vehicle sequencing problem for adjacent intersections under the framework of Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM). In the context of AIM, autonomous vehicles are considered to be independent individuals and the traffic control aims at deciding on an efficient vehicle passing sequence. Since there are considerable vehicle passing combinations, how to find an efficient vehicle passing sequence in a short time becomes a big challenge, especially for more than one intersection. In this paper, we present a technique for combining certain vehicles into some basic groups with reference to some properties discussed in our earlier works. A genetic algorithm based on these basic groups is designed to find an optimal or a near-optimal vehicle passing sequence for each intersection. Computational experiments verify that the proposed genetic algorithms can response quickly for several intersections. Simulations with continuous vehicles are carried out with application of the proposed algorithm or existing traffic control methods. The results show that the traffic condition can be significantly improved by our algorithm.

AB The recent proliferation of computing technologies (e.g., sensors, computer vision, machine learning, and hardware acceleration) and the broad deployment of communication mechanisms (e.g., dedicated short-range communication, cellular vehicle-to-everything, 5G) have pushed the horizon of autonomous driving, which automates the decision and control of vehicles by leveraging the perception results based on multiple sensors. The key to the success of these autonomous systems is making a reliable decision in real-time fashion. However, accidents and fatalities caused by early deployed autonomous vehicles arise from time to time. The real traffic environment is too complicated for current autonomous driving computing systems to understand and handle. In this article, we present state-of-the-art computing systems for autonomous driving, including seven performance metrics and nine key technologies, followed by 12 challenges to realize autonomous driving. We hope this article will gain attention from both the computing and automotive communities and inspire more research in this direction.

AB In this paper, a sliding mode-based guidance strategy is proposed for the control of an autonomous vehicle. The aim of the autonomous vehicle deployment is the study of unknown environmental spatial features. The proposed approach allows the solution of both boundary tracking and source-seeking problems with a single autonomous vehicle capable of sensing the value of the spatial field at its position. The movement of the vehicle is controlled through the proposed guidance strategy, which is designed on the basis of the collected measurements without the necessity of preplanning or human intervention. Moreover, no a priori knowledge about the field and its gradient is required. The proposed strategy is based on the so-called suboptimal sliding mode controller. The guidance strategy is demonstrated by computer-based simulations and a set of boundary tracking experimental sea trials. The efficacy of the algorithm to autonomously steer the C-Enduro surface vehicle to follow a fixed depth contour in a dynamic coastal region is demonstrated by the results from the trial described in this paper.

AB We examined how trip-level characteristics may influence autonomous vehicle ownership decisions. Using 639 stated preference survey responses in the US, we developed an integrated choice and latent variable model linking trip- and consumer-level characteristics to AV ownership choices. Results suggested parking cost, travel cost and travel time are important predictors for vehicle ownership at the trip-level; and monthly payment, car ownership importance and autonomous vehicle safety perceptions are significant predictors at the consumer-level. By examining elasticities of vehicle ownership market shares, we found while consumer-level characteristics have the most prominent effect on vehicle ownership decisions, trip-level characteristics have a small but measurable effect. Among trip-level characteristics, parking cost has the largest impact on vehicle ownership decisions, followed by travel cost of ridehailing (both conventional and autonomous), and transit travel time. Finally, we simulated future vehicle ownership decisions under three policy scenarios by leveraging trip- and consumer-level characteristics.

AB This study focused on identifying customers & acute; real-life experiences, perceptions and feelings about travelling in different autonomous vehicles and in various operating conditions in Finland in 2018. Quantitative convenience sample (n = 141) were collected from passengers travelling on an autonomous shuttle bus in Helsinki. Qualitative data (n = 70) were gathered by interviewing passengers of a driverless shuttle bus in Helsinki and passengers of an autonomous car in winter conditions in Lapland. This research was first one which included passengers' real-life experiences after using autonomous vehicles in winter conditions. We applied the Theory of Planned Behaviour. The research questions were (a) What beliefs about outcomes and evaluation of outcomes do passengers have and carry out when they travel in an autonomous vehicle, irrespective of vehicle type or operating conditions? (b) What key factors influence people's positive or negative attitudes towards autonomous vehicles? (c) What key factors could induce people to use autonomous vehicles? The quantitative data were analysed by nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis H test and qualitative data by inductive content analysis. According to the results, trust, safety and security were the main factors influencing people's positive attitudes towards using autonomous vehicles. Results from passengers travelling in heavy winter conditions indicate that winter conditions do not significantly influence passengers' attitudes towards using autonomous vehicles. There were no significant differences between gender regarding passengers' perceptions of traffic safety, personal security and emergency management. However, younger passengers felt their personal security on board to be significantly better than older and students their possibilities to act in a case of emergency significantly better than employed people.

AB This study proposes adopting linguistic politeness in vehicle speech interfaces, as active communication between drivers and vehicles will become an essential part of driving with advanced autonomous driving technologies. Two between-subjects experiments were conducted to test the influences of politeness strategies (i.e., asking help, giving a reason, expressing gratitude) on drivers' perceptions of the vehicles. The results indicate that drivers evaluate polite vehicles as more sociable and trustworthy, and they perceive polite instructions were more acceptable. The results also suggest that providing reasons for requests and expressing gratitude for drivers' cooperation can be an optimal linguistic strategy in vehicle speech interfaces. Moreover, this study identifies the layers of heuristics in the process of shaping trust in autonomous vehicles. Drivers can instantly recognize politeness in vehicle speech interfaces, and this politeness heuristic was found to increase drivers' perception of social presence, thereby heightening drivers' trust in the autonomous vehicles.

AB Realizing autonomous inspection, such as that of power distribution lines, through unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems is a key research domain in robotics. In particular, the use of autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles to execute the tasks of an inspection process can enhance the efficacy and safety of the operation; however, many technical problems, such as those pertaining to the precise positioning and path following of the vehicles, robust obstacle detection, and intelligent control, must be addressed. In this study, an innovative architecture involving an unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV) and an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) was examined for detailed inspections of power lines. In the proposed strategy, each vehicle provides its position information to the other, which ensures a safe inspection process. The results of real-world experiments indicate a satisfactory performance, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed approach.

AB This paper presents stochastic models for multi-tier warehouse systems that handle unit load transactions using autonomous vehicle-based technology. In this system, self-powered autonomous vehicles carry out unit-load transactions by moving along rails within a tier and using lifts or conveyors for vertical movement between tiers. We develop semi-open queuing network models to evaluate congestion effects in processing storage and retrieval transactions in this system. The queuing network is evaluated using a decomposition-based approach. The queuing model provides design insights on the effect of vehicle interference and vertical transfer mechanism on various system performance measures of interest. Insights from such studies can be especially useful during the conceptualization stage of warehouses that use autonomous vehicle technology.

AB Human error has been statistically proven to be the primary cause of road accidents. This undoubtedly is a contributory cause of the rising popularity of autonomous vehicles as they are presumably able to maneuver appropriately/optimally on the roads while diminishing the likelihood of human error and its repercussion. However, autonomous vehicles are not ready for widespread adoption because their safety and security issues are yet to be thoroughly investigated/addressed. Little literature could be found on collaborative analysis of safety and security of autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes a framework for analyzing both safety and security issues, which includes an integrated safety and security method (S&S) with international vehicle safety and security standards ISO 26262 and SAE J3061. The applicability of the proposed framework is demonstrated using an example of typical autonomous vehicle model. Using this framework, one can clearly understand the vehicle functions, structure, the associated failures and attacks, and also see the vulnerabilities that are not yet addressed by countermeasures, which helps to improve the in-vehicle safety and security from researching and engineering perspectives.

AB Autonomous vehicles are one of the emergent advances of the new technology era that has the prospective to redesign transportation structures. Understanding and measuring the limitations of adopting autonomous vehicles and selecting the best autonomous vehicle based on different aspects is crucial for enhancing the adoption process. Defining the criteria and the appropriate evaluation methodology is very important for selecting the best autonomous vehicles. However, this selection process is a human judgment-based process where both benefit and cost criteria with imprecise linguistic assessments should be considered. The KEmeny Median Indicator Ranks Accordance (KEMIRA) method is a method that enables ranking the benefit and cost criteria independently. In this paper, a new KEMIRA method based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets is defined. Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Sets (HFLTS) are newly utilized to represent the hesitancy of the decision-makers. The proposed new KEMIRA is approach the first study that defines the alternative scores and weights of the criteria via HFLTS. The computational steps of the new model are applied to autonomous vehicle selection. A real application is employed to show the applicability of the new KEMIRA method.

AB Recent autonomous intelligent transportation systems commonly adopt vehicular communication. Efficient communication between autonomous vehicles-to-everything (AV2X) is mandatory to ensure road safety by decreasing traffic jamming, approaching emergency vehicle warning, and assisting in low visibility traffic. In this paper, a new adaptive AV2X model, based on a novel optimization method to enhance the connectivity of the vehicular networks, is proposed. The presented model optimizes the inter-vehicle position to communicate with the autonomous vehicle (AV) or to relay information to everything. Based on the system quality-of-service (QoS) being achieved, a decision will be taken whether the transmitting AV communicates directly to the destination or through cooperative communication. To achieve the given objectives, the best position of the relay-vehicle issue was mathematically formulated as a constrained optimization problem to enhance the communication between AV2X under different environmental conditions. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, the following factors are considered: distribution of vehicles, vehicle density, vehicle mobility and speed. Simulation results show how the proposed model outperforms other previous models and enhances system performance in terms of four benchmark aspects: throughput (S), packet loss rate (PLR), packet delivery ratio (PDR) and average delivery latency (DL).

AB In this paper, a Kalman filtering-based motion state estimation method for an autonomous vehicle-trailer system by fusing multiple sensor data is presented. This system can be applied directly to autonomous navigation and motion control. The autonomous vehicle-trailer system consists of an autonomous vehicle and a passive trailer which are coupled by a trailer hitch. The vehicle-trailer system is equipped with the Global Positioning System (GPS), endocder-based odometry and hitch angle sensors. Using GPS and odometry sensors, two independent vehicle motion informations which include orientation, position (localization) and velocity data were obtained. Then, a Kalman filtering method by fusing odometry, GPS and hitch angle sesnsor data simultaneously were applied to provide robust and more accurate motion state estimation for the vehicle-trailer system in the presence of sensor noises. Finally, a full verification of the Kalman filtering-based motion state estimation method was done through simulation and experimental tests.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL
AB This article describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of an active lane change control algorithm for autonomous vehicles with human factor considerations. Lane changes need to be performed considering both driver acceptance and safety with surrounding vehicles. Therefore, autonomous driving systems need to be designed based on an analysis of human driving behavior. In this article, manual driving characteristics are investigated using real-world driving test data. In lane change situations, interactions with surrounding vehicles were mainly investigated. And safety indices were developed with kinematic analysis. A safety indices-based lane change decision and control algorithm has been developed. In order to improve safety, stochastic predictions of both the ego vehicle and surrounding vehicles have been conducted with consideration of sensor noise and model uncertainties. The desired driving mode is decided to cope with all lane changes on highway. To obtain desired reference and constraints, motion planning for lane changes has been designed taking stochastic prediction-based safety indices into account. A stochastic model predictive control with constraints has been adopted to determine vehicle control inputs: the steering angle and the longitudinal acceleration. The proposed active lane change algorithm has been successfully implemented on an autonomous vehicle and evaluated via real-world driving tests. Safe and comfortable lane changes in high-speed driving on highways have been demonstrated using our autonomous test vehicle.

AB Nowadays, with the advancement of technology, world is trending toward high mobility and dynamics. In this context, intersection management (IM) as one of the most crucial elements of the transportation sector demands high attention. Today, road entities including infrastructures, vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as motorcycles, moped, scooters, pedestrians, bicycles, and other types of vehicles such as trucks, buses, cars, emergency vehicles, and railway vehicles like trains or trams are able to communicate cooperatively using vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications and provide traffic safety, efficiency, infotainment and ecological improvements. In this paper, we take into account different types of intersections in terms of signalized, semi-autonomous (hybrid) and autonomous intersections and conduct a comprehensive survey on various intersection management methods for heterogeneous connected vehicles (CVs). We consider heterogeneous classes of vehicles such as road and rail vehicles as well as VRUs including bicycles, scooters and motorcycles. All kinds of intersection goals, modeling, coordination architectures, scheduling policies are thoroughly discussed. Signalized and semi-autonomous intersections are assessed with respect to these parameters. We especially focus on autonomous intersection management (AIM) and categorize this section based on four major goals involving safety, efficiency, infotainment and environment. Each intersection goal provides an in-depth investigation on the corresponding literature from the aforementioned perspectives. Moreover, robustness and resiliency of IM are explored from diverse points of view encompassing sensors, information management and sharing, planning universal scheme, heterogeneous collaboration, vehicle classification, quality measurement, external factors, intersection types, localization faults, communication anomalies and channel optimization, synchronization, vehicle dynamics and model mismatch, model uncertainties, recovery, security and privacy.

AB Autonomous vehicle functions in safety-critical situations show promise in reducing the risk and saving lives in accidents compared to existing safety systems. Consequently, it is from many perspectives advantageous to be able to quantify the potential benefits of new autonomous systems for vehicle maneuvers at-the-limit of tire friction. Here, to estimate the potential in terms of saved lives and reduced degree of injuries in accidents for new, not yet existing systems, a framework has been developed by combining available historic data, in the form of crash databases, and statistical methods with comparative calculations of vehicle behavior using numerical optimization rather than simulation. The framework performs effectively, it gives interesting insights into the relation between more traditional active yaw control and optimal autonomous lane-keeping control, and it clearly demonstrates the potential of saved lives by using autonomous vehicle maneuvers.

With current autonomous platforms limited in their operation, for example aerial platforms only operate in air, ASVs only operate on the ocean surface and AUVs operate subsea, a platform which can operate, transiting and transitioning in and between air, surface and subsea, providing increased mobility is very attractive. In this paper, a novel AxV platform is described. The governing equations are presented, describing each operational mode and the transitions between modes (air to surface, surface to subsea, subsea to surface, surface to air). Results are presented based on the dimensions of existing vehicles, showing that the system is theoretically feasible.

AB Autonomous braking through vehicle precise decision-making and control to reduce accidents is a key issue, especially in the early diffusion phase of autonomous vehicle development. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based autonomous braking decision-making strategy in an emergency situation. Three key influencing factors, including efficiency, accuracy and passengers' comfort, are fully considered and satisfied by the proposed strategy. First, the vehicle lane-changing process and the braking process are analyzed in detail, which include the critical factors in the design of the autonomous braking strategy. Second, we propose a DRL process that determines the optimal strategy for autonomous braking. Particularly, a multi-objective reward function is designed, which can compromise the rewards achieved of different brake moments, the degree of the accident, and the comfort of the passenger. Third, a typical actor-critic (AC) algorithm named deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is adopted for solving the autonomous braking problem, which can improve the efficiency of the optimal strategy and be stable in continuous control tasks. Once the strategy is well trained, the vehicle can automatically take optimal braking behavior in an emergency to improve driving safety. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal in terms of learning effectiveness, decision-making accuracy and driving safety.

AB This technical note treats the challenging control problem of tracking a desired continuous trajectory for a maneuverable autonomous vehicle in the presence of gravity, buoyancy and fluid dynamic forces and moments. A realistic dynamics model that applies to maneuverable vehicles moving in 3-D Euclidean space is used for obtaining this control scheme. While applications of this control scheme include autonomous aerial and underwater vehicles, we focus on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) application because of its richer, more nonlinearly coupled, dynamics. The desired trajectory and trajectory tracking errors are globally characterized in the nonlinear state space. Almost global asymptotic stability to the desired trajectory in the nonlinear state space is demonstrated both analytically and through numerical simulations.

AB Left turning for autonomous vehicles at intersections is challenging due to the various driving behaviors from different human drivers and the strong interaction between the autonomous vehicle and human traffic participants. This paper proposes a planning and decision making framework for intersection left-turning which considers the interaction between autonomous vehicles and human drivers as well as pedestrians to address this issue. The proposed framework considers interactions mathematically by formulating the problem as a linear quadratic differential game. Through solving the Nash equilibrium of the game, the autonomous vehicle is able to properly interact with surrounding traffic participants. Under the differential game framework, the accuracy of the interaction formulation is closely related to the behavior model of human drivers. Therefore, real-world human behavior is extracted and evaluated from naturalistic driving dataset to help establish more realistic modeling and estimation of various kinds of traffic participants, including aggressive, neutral and conservative traffic participants. The simulation results show that the autonomous vehicle is able to properly estimate the types of traffic participants by observing their behavior using the proposed technique. Then the autonomous vehicle behave according to the types of those traffic participants to enable interactive and human-like planning and decision making at intersections.

AB Autonomous vehicles promise numerous improvements to vehicular traffic: an increase in both highway capacity and traffic flow because of faster response times, less fuel consumption and pollution thanks to more foresighted driving, and hopefully fewer accidents thanks to collision avoidance systems. In addition, drivers can save time for more useful activities. In order for these vehicles to safely operate in everyday traffic or in harsh off-road environments, a multitude of problems in perception, navigation, and control have to be solved. This paper gives an overview of the most current trends in autonomous vehicles, highlighting the concepts common to most successful systems as well as their differences. It concludes with an outlook into the promising future of autonomous vehicles.

AB It is known that connected and autonomous vehicles are capable of maintaining shorter headway and distances when they form platoons of vehicles. Thus, such technologies can potentially increase the road capacities of traffic networks. Consequently, it is envisioned that their deployment will also increase the overall network mobility. In this paper, we examine the validity of this expected impact, assuming that drivers select their routes selfishly, in traffic networks with mixed vehicle autonomy, that is, traffic networks with both regular and autonomous vehicles. We consider a nonatomic routing game on a network with inelastic (fixed) demands for a set of network origin destination (O/D) pairs, and study how replacing a fraction of regular vehicles by autonomous vehicles will affect the mobility of the network. Using well-known U.S. Bureau of Public Roads traffic delay models, we show that the resulting Wardrop equilibrium is not necessarily unique for networks with mixed autonomy. Then, we state the conditions under which the total network delay at equilibrium is guaranteed to not increase as the fraction of autonomous vehicles increases. However, we show that when these conditions do not hold, counterintuitive behaviors may occur-the total network delay can grow as the fraction of autonomous cars increases. In particular, we prove that for networks with a single O/D pair, if the road degrees of capacity asymmetry (i.e., the ratio between the road capacity when all vehicles are regular and the road capacity when all vehicles are autonomous) are homogeneous, the total delay is: 1) unique and 2) a nonincreasing continuous function of the fraction of autonomous vehicles in the network. We show that for heterogeneous degrees of capacity asymmetry, the total delay is not unique, and it can further grow as the fraction of autonomous vehicles increases. We demonstrate that similar behaviors may be observed in networks with multiple O/D pairs. We further bound such performance degradations due to the introduction of autonomy in general homogeneous networks.

AB Autonomous mobility systems developed for unmanned ground vehicles may have additional benefits by enhancing system performance and reducing demands on operators for manned ground vehicles. This effort examines the potential impact of introducing autonomous mobility to control manned vehicles while operators performed secure mobility. Eleven Soldiers participated in an experimental task requiring concurrent control of a manned and an unmanned Stryker performing a road march, scanning of the local environment for targets, and planning of a reconnaissance route for a third simulated asset. The control of the manned vehicle was varied between autonomous. and manual control and several speed and accuracy variables were examined for each task. Subjective measures of operator workload, stress, and motion sickness were also examined. The results support the potential benefits of incorporating autonomous mobility into manned platforms. In speed-matched conditions, autonomous mobility was associated with decreased manned vehicle mission time, faster operator reaction times to targets, greater instances of multitasking while under motion, and lower subjective operator workload measures than with manual driving. In conclusion, autonomous mobility technologies have the potential to free up resources from the vehicle operator and allow for better operator performance on tasks other than vehicle control.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Autonomous vehicle technology has developed at an unprecedented rate in recent years. An increasing number of vehicles are equipped with different levels of driving assist systems to reduce the human driver's burden. However, because of the conservative design of its programming framework, there is still a large gap between the performance of current autonomous driving systems and experienced veteran drivers. This gap can cause drivers to distrust decisions or behaviors made by autonomous vehicles, thus affecting the effectiveness of drivers' use of auto-driving systems. To further estimate the expected acceptance of autonomous driving systems in real human-machine co-driving situations, a characterization model of driver confidence has to be constructed. This paper conducts a survey of driver confidence in riding autonomous vehicles. Based on the analysis of results, the paper proposes a confidence quantification model called "the Virtual Confidence (VC)" by quantifying three main factors affecting driver confidence in autonomous vehicles, including (1) the intrusive movements of surrounding traffic participants, (2) the abnormal behavior of the ego vehicle, and (3) the complexity of the driving environment. The model culminates in a dynamic confidence bar with values ranging from 0 to 100 to represent the levels of confidence. The validation of the confidence model was verified by doing comparisons between the real-time output of the VC and the real-time feeling of human drivers on an autonomous vehicle simulator. The proposed VC model can potentially identify features that need improvement for auto-driving systems in unmanned tests and provide data reference.

AB Driverless vehicles (i.e., autonomous and shared autonomous vehicles) are associated with many advantages for the transportation market. However, they may also increase the traveled miles on roads due to improved accessibility, thus aggravating congestion. Road pricing (RP) is a possible solution for mitigating traffic-related problems like congestion. Despite its benefits, RP is usually resented by the public, which may hinder its introduction. This study investigates the factors that may influence RP acceptability in the era of driverless vehicles and driverless vehicle adoption in the presence of RP. For this purpose, a survey was distributed in Hungary, Jordan, Ukraine, and Brazil. The study applied factor analysis, multiple linear regression, and multinomial logit modeling to examine RP acceptability and driverless vehicle adoption. All examined factors have a significant impact on mode choice. For instance, respondents willing to share their trips with others due to the application of RP, opted for shared autonomous vehicles, while those who enjoy driving were less likely to choose autonomous vehicles. In terms of RP acceptability, the respondents who were environmentally conscious in their trip planning showed more acceptance of RP. This study shows the significant impacts of the investigated factors on RP acceptability and driverless vehicle adoption.

AB The objective of this study is to examine the user's adoption aspects of autonomous vehicle, as well as to investigate what factors drive people to trust an autonomous vehicle. A model explaining the impact of different factors on autonomous vehicles' intention is developed based on the technology acceptance model and trust theory. A survey of 552 drivers was conducted and the results were analyzed using partial least squares. The results demonstrated that perceived usefulness and trust are major important determinants of intention to use autonomous vehicles. The results also show that three constructs-system transparency, technical competence, and situation management-have a positive effect on trust. The study identified that trust has a negative effect on perceived risk. Among the driving-related personality traits, locus of control has significant effects on behavioral intention, whereas sensation seeking did not. This study investigated that the developed model explains the factors that influence the acceptance of autonomous vehicle. The results of this study provide evidence on the importance of trust in the user's acceptance of an autonomous vehicle.

AB This paper presents a novel integrated approach to deal with the decision making and motion planning for lane-change maneuvers of autonomous vehicle (AV) considering social behaviors of surrounding traffic occupants. Reflected by driving styles and intentions of surrounding vehicles, the social behaviors are taken into consideration during the modelling process. Then, the Stackelberg Game theory is applied to solve the decision-making, which is formulated as a non-cooperative game problem. Besides, potential field is adopted in the motion planning model, which uses different potential functions to describe surrounding vehicles with different behaviors and road constraints. Then, Model Predictive Control (MPC) is utilized to predict the state and trajectory of the autonomous vehicle. Finally, the decision-making and motion planning is then integrated into a constrained multi-objective optimization problem. Three testing scenarios considering different social behaviors of surrounding vehicles are carried out to validate the performance of the proposed approach. Testing results show that the integrated approach is able to address different social interactions with other traffic participants, and make proper and safe decisions and planning for autonomous vehicles, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness.

AB Autonomous vehicles must operate safely in their dynamic and continuously-changing environment. However, the operating environment of an autonomous vehicle is complicated and full of various types of uncertainties. Additionally, the operating environment has many configurations, including static and dynamic obstacles with which an autonomous vehicle must avoid collisions. Though various approaches targeting environment configuration for autonomous vehicles have shown promising results, their effectiveness in dealing with a continuous-changing environment is limited. Thus, it is essential to learn realistic environment configurations of continuously-changing environment, under which an autonomous vehicle should be tested regarding its ability to avoid collisions. Featured with agents dynamically interacting with the environment, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great potential in dealing with complicated problems requiring adapting to the environment. To this end, we present an RL-based environment configuration learning approach, i.e., DeepCollision, which intelligently learns environment configurations that lead an autonomous vehicle to crash. DeepCollision employs Deep Q-Learning as the RL solution, and selects collision probability as the safety measure, to construct the reward function. We trained four DeepCollision models and conducted an experiment to compare them with two baselines, i.e., random and greedy. Results show that DeepCollision demonstrated significantly better effectiveness in generating collisions compared with the baselines. We also provide recommendations on configuring DeepCollision with the most suitable time interval based on different road structures.

AB Autonomous vehicle is able to facilitate road safety and traffic efficiency and has become a promising trend of future development. With a focus on highways, existing literatures studied the feasibility of autonomous vehicle in continuous traffic flows and the controllability of cooperative driving. However, rare efforts have been made to investigate the traffic control strategies in autonomous vehicle environment on urban roads, especially in urban intersections. In autonomous vehicle environment, it is possible to achieve cooperative driving with V2V and V2I wireless communication. Without signal control, conflicted traffic flows could pass intersections through mutual cooperative, which is a remarkable improvement to existing traffic control methods. This paper established a cellular automata model with greedy algorithm for the traffic control of intersections in autonomous vehicle environment, with autonomous vehicle platoon as the optimization object. NetLogo multiagent simulation platform model was employed to simulate the proposed model. The simulation results are compared with the traffic control programs in conventional Synchro optimization. The findings suggest that, on the premises of ensuring traffic safety, the control strategy of the proposed model significantly reduces average delays and number of stops as well as increasing traffic capacity.

AB Vehicular technology has recently gained increasing popularity, and autonomous driving is a hot topic. To achieve safe and reliable intelligent transportation systems, accurate positioning technologies need to be built to factor in the different types of uncertainties such as pedestrian behavior, random objects, and types of roads and their settings. In this work, we look into the other domains and technologies required to build an autonomous vehicle and conduct a relevant literature analysis. In this work, we look into the current state of research and development in environment detection, pedestrian detection, path planning, motion control, and vehicle cybersecurity for autonomous vehicles. We aim to study the different proposed technologies and compare their approaches. For a car to become fully autonomous, these technologies need to be accurate enough to gain public trust and show immense accuracy in their approach to solving these problems. Public trust and perception of auto vehicles are also explored in this paper. By discussing the opportunities as well as the obstacles of autonomous driving technology, we aim to shed light on future possibilities.

AB Autonomous lane keeping is an important safety feature for intelligent vehicles. This paper presents a lane keeping simulator that is built with image projections of recorded data in conjunction with vehicle dynamics estimation. An end-to-end learning method using convolutional neural network (CNN) takes front-view camera data as input and produces the proper steering wheel angle to keep the vehicle in lane. A novel method of data augmentation is proposed using vehicle dynamic model and vehicle trajectory tracking, which can create additional training data as if a vehicle drives off-lane in any displacement and orientation. Experimental results demonstrate that the CNN model trained with the simulator can achieve higher accuracy for autonomous lane keeping and much lower failure rate. The simulator can serve as a platform for both training and evaluation of vision based autonomous driving algorithms. The experimental dataset is made available at < uri > http://computing.wpi.edu/dataset.html </uri >.

AB The potential benefits of autonomous vehicles, including safety, convenience, fuel economy, and low emissions can only be achieved when consumers are comfortable with the vehicle design. There are only a limited number of user studies in the design of future autonomous vehicles, owing to the difficulties of shifting focus "from the present to the future." An integrated method of simulator study and user enactment was applied in the research to bridge the gap between the current and the future. Thirty drivers participated in the study to experience enacted driving scenarios in an autonomous vehicle simulator. The participants were divided into two groups, i.e., driving-alone drivers and driving-with-a-passenger drivers, to investigate the effect of passenger presence. Rich data were elicited about possible in-vehicle activities, the corresponding requirements of information and functions to support any such activities. Also identified were the preferred methods of interacting with the information and functions. Passenger presence was found to have an influence on the attributes of activities undertaken as well as the preferences for in-vehicle information and functions. Dominant themes were identified in future autonomous vehicle designs, including a more flexible and adaptive design language, concerns of trust and safety, and trade-offs between safety and convenience and between privacy and social connection. Based on the findings, design implications for future autonomous vehicles are discussed.

ID TRAJECTORY PREDICTION
AB Autonomous driving vehicles can effectively improve traffic conditions and promote the development of intelligent transportation systems. An autonomous vehicle can be divided into four parts: environment perception, motion prediction, motion planning, and motion control, among which the motion prediction module plays an essential role in the sustainability of autonomous driving vehicles. Vehicle motion prediction improves autonomous vehicles' understanding of the surrounding dynamic environment, which reduces the uncertainty in the decision-making system and facilitates the implementation of an active braking system for autonomous vehicles. Currently, deep learning-based methods have become prevalent in this field as they can efficiently process complex scene information and achieve long-term prediction. These methods often follow a similar paradigm: encoding scene input to obtain the context feature, then decoding the context feature to output predictions. Recent research has proposed innovative improvement designs to enhance the primary paradigm. Thus, we review recent works based on their improvement designs and summarize them based on three criteria: scene input representation, context refinement, and prediction rationality improvement. Although most works focus on trajectory prediction, this paper also discusses new occupancy flow prediction methods. Additionally, this paper outlines commonly used datasets, evaluation metrics, and potential research directions.

AB Autonomous vehicles are gradually being regarded as the mainstream trend of future development of the automobile industry. Autonomous driving networks generate many intensive and delay-sensitive computing tasks. The storage space, computing power, and battery capacity of autonomous vehicle terminals cannot meet the resource requirements of the tasks. In this paper, we focus on the task scheduling problem of autonomous driving in software-defined edge networks. By analyzing the intensive and delay-sensitive computing tasks of autonomous vehicles, we propose an emotion model that is related to task urgency and changes with execution time and propose an optimal base station (BS) task scheduling (OBSTS) algorithm. Task sentiment is an important factor that changes with the length of time that computing tasks with different urgency levels remain in the queue. The algorithm uses task sentiment as a performance indicator to measure task scheduling.

AB Security of (semi)-autonomous vehicles is a growing concern, first, due to the increased exposure of the functionality to potential attackers; second, due to the reliance of functionalities on diverse (semi)-autonomous systems; third, due to the interaction of a single-vehicle with myriads of other smart systems in urban traffic infrastructure. Beyond these technical issues, we argue that the security-by-design principle for smart and complex autonomous systems, such as an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) is poorly understood and rarely practiced. Unlike traditional IT systems, where the risk mitigation techniques and adversarial models are well studied and developed with security design principles such as security perimeter and defense-in-depth, the lack of such a framework for connected autonomous systems is plaguing the design and implementation of a secure AV. We attempt to identify the core issues of securing an AV. This is done methodically by developing a security-by-design framework for AV from the first principles. Subsequently, the technical challenges for AV security are identified.

AB A new vision-based long-distance lane perception and front vehicle location method was developed for decision making of full autonomous vehicles on highway roads. Firstly, a real-time long-distance lane detection approach was presented based on a linear-cubic road model for two-lane highways. By using a novel robust lane marking feature which combines the constraints of intensity, edge and width, the lane markings in far regions were extracted accurately and efficiently. Next, the detected lane lines were selected and tracked by estimating the lateral offset and heading angle of ego vehicle with a Kalman filter. Finally, front vehicles were located on correct lanes using the tracked lane lines. Experiment results show that the proposed lane perception approach can achieve an average correct detection rate of 94.37% with an average false positive detection rate of 0.35%. The proposed approaches for long-distance lane perception and front vehicle location were validated in a 286 km full autonomous drive experiment under real traffic conditions. This successful experiment shows that the approaches are effective and robust enough for full autonomous vehicles on highway roads.

AB How to complete a lane changing process considering various variables has always been a critical issue in the field of autonomous driving. Developing a lane-changing decision model with full consideration of the surrounding vehicles and related decisionbased trajectory planning model that comprehensively weighs safety and efficiency are conducive to the driving of autonomous vehicles (AVs) under mixed autonomous vehicle and human-driven vehicle (AV-HV) environment. Under the mixed AV-HV environment, we optimize a multi-player dynamic game model considering the status of surrounding vehicles to ensure the accurate execution of lane-changing decision of AVs. Lane changing trajectory of AV is planned based on polynomial curves, which can be dynamically updated according to the real-time status of vehicles and game results. Then, a computational experiment basing on the lane changing vehicles data from NGSIM (Next Generation Simulation) is performed with proposed models. The simulation results show that the lane-changing decision and trajectory planning model developed in our research have good adaptability to lane changing process in different scenarios, which can effectively measure the driving intention of surrounding vehicles and dynamically plan a smooth trajectory line considering safety and efficiency.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB The introduction of connected and autonomous vehicles will bring changes to the highway driving environment. Connected vehicle technology provides real-time information about the surrounding traffic condition and the traffic management center's decisions. Such information is expected to improve drivers' efficiency, response, and comfort while enhancing safety and mobility. Connected vehicle technology can also further increase efficiency and reliability of autonomous vehicles, though these vehicles could be operated solely with their on-board sensors, without communication. While several studies have examined the possible effects of connected and autonomous vehicles on the driving environment, most of the modeling approaches in the literature do not distinguish between connectivity and automation, leaving many questions unanswered regarding the implications of different contemplated deployment scenarios. There is need for a comprehensive acceleration framework that distinguishes between these two technologies while modeling the new connected environment. This study presents a framework that utilizes different models with technology-appropriate assumptions to simulate different vehicle types with distinct communication capabilities. The stability analysis of the resulting traffic stream behavior using this framework is presented for different market penetration rates of connected and autonomous vehicles. The analysis reveals that connected and autonomous vehicles can improve string stability: Moreover, automation is found to be more effective in preventing shockwave formation and propagation under the model's assumptions. In addition to stability, the effects of these technologies on throughput are explored, suggesting substantial potential throughput increases under certain penetration scenarios.

ID ATTACKS
AB Deep neural network (DNN) models are widely used in autonomous vehicles for object detection using camera images. However, these models are vulnerable to adversarial image perturbations. Existing methods for generating these perturbations use the image frame as the decision variable, resulting in a computationally expensive optimization process that starts over for each new image. Few approaches have been developed for attacking online image streams while considering the physical dynamics of autonomous vehicles, their mission, and the environment. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-level stochastic optimization framework that monitors the attacker's capability to generate adversarial perturbations. Our framework introduces a binary decision attack/not attack based on the attacker's capability level to enhance its effectiveness. We evaluate our proposed framework using simulations for vision-guided autonomous vehicles and actual tests with a small indoor drone in an office environment. Our results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating real-time image attacks while monitoring the attacker's proficiency given state estimates.

AB Autonomous vehicles are capable of sensing their environment and navigating without any human inputs. However, when autonomous vehicles are involved in accidents between themselves or with human subjects, liability must be indubitably decided based on accident forensics. This paper proposes a blockchain-inspired event recording system for autonomous vehicles. Specifically, we design the mechanism of "Proof-of-Event" with a dynamic federation consensus to achieve indisputable accident forensics by providing trustable and verifiable event information. We propose a dynamic federation consensus scheme to verify and confirm the new block of event data in an efficient way without any central authority. We conduct numerical analyses and prototyped experiments based on the proposed fast leader election algorithm and the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network. The results show that our system is effective and feasible in generating and storing accident records in blockchain-based vehicular networks. The security capability of the proposed scheme is also discussed against multiple threats and attack scenarios.

AB Autonomous vehicles can obtain abundant road traffic information and communicate with each other using intelligent transportation system. For the purpose of detecting the influence of backward looking effect on the traffic flow of autonomous vehicles and better providing driving decisions for autonomous vehicles, in this study, a novel car-following model is presented accounting for the backward looking effect on the basis of the two velocity difference model. The stability condition of this novel model in autonomous vehicles flow is established by incorporating the linear stability theory. The Burgers equation, Korteweg-de Vries equation, and modified Korteweg-de Vries equation are inferred based on nonlinear analysis to describe triangular wave, soliton wave, and kink-antikink wave, corresponding to the stable, metastable, and unstable regions of autonomous vehicles flow separately. Subsequently, numerical simulation is performed, exhibiting that this novel model can strengthen the traffic flow stability of autonomous vehicles and simulate the above three different density waves of traffic flow. In addition, the numerical simulation also further verifies the accuracy of the theoretical analysis.

AB Vehicle automation is expected to reduce the cost of driving and to solve social problems, such as traffic accidents. However, despite the expected benefits of autonomous vehicles, some consumers hesitate to adopt autonomous vehicles due to fears of negative effects from vehicle automation. This study analyzes consumers' heterogeneous preferences for autonomous vehicles using a discrete choice experiment and a latent class model, which enables the clustering of consumer preferences. As a result, consumers' preferences for autonomous vehicles are largely divided into two groups: one group is technology-friendly users (78.0%), and the other group is change avoiders (22.0%). Technology-friendly users tend to prefer advanced vehicle automation and intend to offer their personal information for advanced functions if the information is highly secured and protected. However, change avoiders express tendencies to avoid highly active vehicle automation and are reluctant to use their personal information for operating automation systems. Change avoiders think that laws or regulations specialised for vehicle automation are redundant. In addition, technology-friendly users and change avoiders prefer conditional automation and driver assistance, respectively.

AB The field of autonomous vehicles is an area of great importance nowadays among Intelligent Transport Systems. These autonomous vehicles must meet high standards of robustness, safety and protection to make autonomous driving safer than human driving, thus improving current accident rates and energy efficiency, so its complete implementation in the market is expected in the long term. However, there are other areas, such as the agricultural and military sectors, where the demand for technologies related to autonomous driving is also high but the applicability could be faster. In this sense, the unmanned ground military vehicles (UGV) are a technology available in international armies for some years, but that is still subject to a series of technical, logistical and material limitations that reduce its applicability. This paper presents an automation kit for transforming military service vehicles into military UGVs, developed through the transfer of autonomous vehicle technology from the civil sector to the military sector. This kit has been installed in a quite common vehicle of the Spanish army, in order to provide two functional capabilities: autonomous navigation and teleoperation, in off-road environments with minimal or no traffic marks or infrastructure aids. The vehicle equipped with this kit is oriented to different missions such as circulation in convoys, operation as tele-operated probe vehicle and perimeter surveillance. The automation kit involves no permanent modifications in the vehicle that can be driven manually when desired, allows vehicles to be used both in missions in conflict zones and to support operations in emergencies and natural catastrophes, and can be easily installed in any kind of vehicle.

AB Despite technological advances, trust still remains as a major issue facing autonomous vehicles. Existing studies have reported that explanations of the status of automation systems can be an effective strategy to increase trust, but these effects can differ depending on the forms of explanations and autonomous driving situations. To address this issue, this study examines the effects of explanation types and perceived risk on trust in autonomous vehicles. Three types of explanations (i.e., no, simple, and attributional explanations) are designed based on attribution theory. Additionally, four autonomous driving situations with different levels of risk are designed based on a simulator program. Results show that explanation type significantly affects trust in autonomous vehicles, and the perceived risk of driving situations significantly moderates the effect of the explanation type. At a high level of perceived risk, attributional explanations and no explanations lead to the lowest and highest values in trust, respectively. However, at a low level of perceived risk, these effects reverse. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Autonomous driving is one of the promising technologies to tackle traffic accident and congestion problems nowadays. Even though an autonomous vehicle is operated without humans, it is necessary to reflect the driving characteristics of a human driver. This can increase user acceptance to autonomous driving system, which in turn will improve driving safety because of human occupants' trust in it. In this paper, a combined trajectory planning and tracking algorithm is proposed for the vehicle control. Firstly, traffic environments and driving styles are modeled with the Artificial Potential Field (APF) approach. Secondly, those APF values are integrated into the Model Predictive Control (MPC) design process, which can optimize the trajectories and control outputs. In this way, we add people's driving habits and styles into the controller, so that the controlled vehicle can move under the effects of the traffic environments and human's driving styles. At last, autonomous driving, which reflects two types of human drivers' driving styles (a cautious driving style and an aggressive one), is tested by the simulation experiments in two scenarios (car-following and lane-changing). Furthermore, the result demonstrates that the proposed algorithm can reflect driving styles. Accordingly, this novel controller can be utilized in the autonomous vehicle control field.

AB To thoroughly test and validate algorithms and systems of autonomous vehicles, a large number of vehicles, many tests and a multitude of datasets are needed. This way of developing and testing is difficult, expensive and sometimes even dangerous. To combine the benefits of real world testing with the scalability and lower cost of simulation based testing, we present a novel methodology for a real-time hybrid simulator that is capable of handling real and simulated vehicles simultaneously with full interaction, in real time. We validated our methodology by assessing its overall performance and real-time capabilities using an F1/10 scale vehicle. The results effectively show the viability of this approach for validation of autonomous vehicles in a cost-efficient and safe manner.

AB Autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems utilize rail-guided vehicles moving in rectilinear paths within and between the aisles of unit load storage racks. Vertical vehicle movement is provided by lifts installed at fixed locations along the rack periphery. As an alternative to traditional automated storage and retrieval systems, autonomous vehicle systems enable users to match vehicle fleet size and the number of lifts to the level of transactions demand in a storage system. Analytical conceptualizing tools based on the features of autonomous vehicle systems are proposed for modelling expected performance as a function of key system attributes including storage capacity, rack configuration and fleet size. The models are demonstrated for a sample problem and compared with analytical conceptualizing tools used for automated storage and retrieval systems.

AB Autonomous intelligent transportation systems consistently require effective and secure communication through vehicular networks, enabling autonomous vehicle communication. The reduction of traffic congestion, the alerting of approaching emergency vehicles, and assistance in low visibility traffic are all made possible by effective communication between autonomous vehicles and everything (AV2X). Therefore, a new adaptive AV2X model is proposed in this paper to improve the connectivity of vehicular networks. This proposed model is based on the optimization method and a distributed deep learning model. The presented approach optimizes the inter-vehicle location if required for ensuring effective communication between the autonomous vehicle (AV) and everything (X) using the Lagrange optimization algorithm. Furthermore, the system is evaluated in terms of energy efficiency and achievable data rate based on the optimal inter-vehicle position to show the significance of the proposed approach. To meet the stated goals, the ideal inter-vehicle position is predicted using a distributed deep learning model by learning from mathematically generated data and defined as a restricted optimization problem using the Lagrange optimization technique to improve communication between AV2X under various environmental conditions. To demonstrate the efficiency of the suggested model, the following characteristics are considered: vehicle dispersion, vehicle density, vehicle mobility, and speed. The simulation results show the significance of the proposed model in terms of energy efficiency and achievable data rate compared with other proposed models.

AB Advances in connected and autonomous vehicles have the promise to reshape the future of the transportation system. How and when the benefits associated with automation and connectivity technology will start to impact the performance of an urban corridor is an issue of interest for traffic operators. This paper proposes an analytical capacity model for urban corridors with mixed traffic based on the concept of macroscopic fundamental diagram. The model incorporates the full spectrum of connected and autonomous vehicle penetration rates as well as the reaction times of different vehicle following patterns. The connected and autonomous vehicle platoon intensity, formulated as an exponential function of the connected and autonomous vehicle penetration rate, is also considered in the proposed analytical capacity model. Numerical experiments are conducted to verify that different reaction time settings yield disparate results. Some reaction time settings were found to cause the corridor capacity to increase monotonically with the connected and autonomous vehicle penetration rate while others led to decreases in corridor capacity with connected and autonomous vehicle penetration rates. Finally, the validity of the proposed methodology is verified via simulation tests in VISSIM 2020.

AB Cost reductions and technological advancements are priming autonomous, electric, and shared vehicles for rapid growth, which may improve safety and mobility, but may also increase vehicle-miles traveled (VMT). This study seeks to improve upon existing fleet evolution work, by simulating the adoption of autonomous, electric, and shared vehicles in a single fleet evolution simulation, calibrated with results of a recent survey of Americans. Statistical models are used in the household-level microsimulation to model decisions regarding vehicle transactions, travel behavior, and land use decisions.
   The simulation predicts a shift in the powertrain makeup of the United States fleet, with hybrid-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles each comprising over 40% of the private fleet by 2050. The rate of decline of the price premium for self-driving vehicle technology has a significant effect on autonomous vehicle (AV) adoption rates. Allowing the ability to retain a human-driving option in self-driving vehicles increases AV adoption rates by roughly 10% by 2050. Shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) use rises to roughly 35% of overall VMT by 2050, about one third of which is via dynamic ride-sharing (DRS). VMT among private vehicles roughly follows adoption rates, though technologies with greater adoption generally experience disproportionately higher VMT.

AB The safety and energy efficiency of autonomous vehicles in the vehicle-following driving scenario is seriously affected by the decision-making framework. This article proposes a safe and energy-saving decision-making framework for autonomous vehicles to avoid the potential rear-end collision and improve the energy efficiency in vehicle-following driving scenario. To realize this framework, the vehicle longitudinal dynamics model is first presented, and the autonomous vehicle's requirements from the safety and energy efficiency perspectives are comprehensively analyzed in the vehicle-following driving scenario. Then, a two-stage decision-making framework is designed. The first stage determines the safety region in the powertrain control domain, and the second stage determines the optimal energy efficiency in the safety region. Based on the two-stage decision-making framework, the perspective of safety first" principle can be enforced by simultaneously considering the driving safety and energy efficiency. Finally, the experiment is conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method by comparing it with two other state-of-art methods.

AB The autonomous vehicle technology has recently been developed rapidly in a wide variety of applications. However, coordinating a team of autonomous vehicles to complete missions in an unknown and changing environment has been a challenging and complicated task. We modify the consensus-based auction algorithm (CBAA) so that it can dynamically reallocate tasks among autonomous vehicles that can flexibly find a path to reach multiple dynamic targets while avoiding unexpected obstacles and staying close as a group as possible simultaneously. We propose the core algorithms and simulate with many scenarios empirically to illustrate how the proposed framework works. Specifically, we show that how autonomous vehicles could reallocate the tasks among each other in finding dynamically changing paths while certain targets may appear and disappear during the movement mission. We also discuss some challenging problems as a future work.

AB To cultivate students' skills in building autonomous vehicle neural network models and to reduce development costs, a system was developed for on-campus training and verification. The system includes (a) autonomous vehicles, (b) test tracks, (c) a data collection and training system, and (d) a test and scoring system. In this system, students can assemble the hardware of the vehicle, configure the software, and choose or modify the neural network model in class. They can then collect the necessary data for the model and train the model. Finally, the system's test and scoring system can be used to test and verify the performance of the autonomous vehicle. The study found that vehicle turning is better controlled by a motor and steering mechanism, and the camera should be mounted in a high position and at the front of the vehicle to avoid interference with the steering mechanism. Additionally, the study revealed that the training and testing speeds of the autonomous vehicle are dependent on each other, and high-quality results cannot be obtained solely by training a model based on camera images.

AB Autonomous vehicle-based storage and retrieval system (AVS/RS) offers considerable flexibility with respect to throughput capacity in the transfer of unit loads in high density storage areas. AVS/RS relies on autonomous vehicles to provide horizontal movement within a tier and uses lifts to provide vertical movement between tiers. In these systems, vehicle blocking delays in the aisles and cross-aisles could significantly impact system throughput and transaction cycle times. In this research, protocols are developed to address vehicle blocking, and a semi-open queueing network model is proposed to analyze system performance and evaluate design trade-offs. A decomposition-based method is used to solve the queueing network and quantify the effect of blocking. This model is adopted to analyze the effect of varying tier configuration parameters such as number of storage locations, depth/width ratio, number of vehicles, and vehicle utilization on blocking delays. These insights are useful for design conceptualization using AVS/RS.

AB A new dynamic obstacle collision avoidance system for the autonomous vehicle is designed and specifically described in this paper. In the system, an obstacle grid map is built primarily based on the data obtained from a 3D laser sensor. The detection and tracking of dynamic obstacles is accomplished by the analysis of obstacle grid map of consecutive frames. The space-time obstacle grid map is used to express the collision situation of dynamic obstacles and the autonomous vehicle. Then based on the space-time obstacle grid map, the behaviour selection and path planning of the autonomous vehicle are accomplished. The system described in this paper has been applied on the two generations of autonomous vehicles, Intelligent Pioneer I and Intelligent Pioneer II, which have already completed 10,000km actual road tests in western suburb of Hefei, and won the first prize in the "Intelligent Vehicle Future Challenge of China" Competition funded by Natural Science Foundation of China.

AB In this paper, the platoon control problem of autonomous vehicles in highway is studied. Since the autonomous vehicles have the characteristics of nonlinearities, external disturbances and strong coupling, a novel adaptive fuzzy sliding coordinated control system is constructed to supervise the longitudinal and lateral motions of autonomous vehicles, in which the fuzzy system is employed to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions. Due to the low sensitivity to disturbances and plant parameter variations, the proposed control approach is an efficient way to handle with the complex dynamic plants operating under un-certainty conditions. The asymptotic stability of adaptive coordinated platoon close-loop control system is verified based on the Lyapunov stability theory. The results indicate that the presented adaptive coordinated platoon control approach can accurately achieve the tracking performance and ensures the stability and riding comfort of autonomous vehicles in a platoon. Finally, simulation test is exploited to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.

AB To improve the online collaboration and planning capabilities between autonomous vehicles, this paper proposes a novel collaborative motion planning method. In this method, the ant colony algorithm was introduced and improved to achieve collaborative motion planning for multiple autonomous vehicles. First, independent subpopulations of the same size were generated according to the number of autonomous vehicles. Then, a multi-objective optimization function was established to optimize spatial collaboration and trajectory costs, and to update the pheromone in the ant colony algorithm. Meanwhile, the evaporation coefficient in the algorithm was adaptively adjusted to enhance the global search ability and improve the convergence speed of the algorithm. Finally, a feasible path was planned for each autonomous vehicle based on the path of each subpopulation. Simulation results show that the proposed method is effective and it can achieve stronger adaptability than the artificial potential field motion planning algorithm.

AB Changing lane must not only ensure the safety of the vehicle itself, but also ensure the patency of the traffic flow of the original lane and the target lane. Therefore, successful lane-changing is a key technology for autonomous vehicle control. In order to avoid collisions and ensure the smooth flow of traffic, in this paper a vehicle dynamics state model with time variable is established as plant, and the lateral force of the steering wheel is further optimized through Model Predictive Control(MPC), and then the steering wheel angle is obtained to complete the lane-changing operation. The longitudinal and lateral logic controllers designed through soft constraints can better achieve the results of successful lane-changing and unsuccessful return to the original lane, and the lane-changing characteristics within the safety corridor are analyzed in several ways. The simulation analysis of lane-changing strategy at different vehicle velocities provides helpful guidance for the design of autonomous vehicle controllers.

AB Freight Urban RoBOTic vehicle (FURBOT) is a complete drive-by-wire vehicle expected to perform autonomously in an urban setting. This upgrading has raised issues that need to be resolved/addressed for the vehicle to achieve a higher level of autonomy. This research addresses two of these main issues. The First is the legal framework/licensing issue necessary to be addressed for the vehicle to be insured and legally drive on public roads. The second is the changes and upgrading the vehicle must go through to become a complete autonomous freight handling vehicle. The outcome of this research led to the decision for correct categorization of the vehicle for resolving its licensing issue and its legal status on the European roads by understanding the limitations of the vehicle, which includes vehicle current state and its structural properties. An additional contribution of this research is identifying the software and hardware changes the vehicle has to go through to be fully autonomous. This includes identification of correct sensors and their placement and quantities. In addition, in-depth study for software identification for the vehicle is provided resulting in favorable choice for an off-the-shelf software. Additionally, foreseeable issues, expectations from the vehicle and requirements (considering its demonstration as an autonomous vehicle) that need to be fulfilled are also highlighted. For demonstration site, use cases and site dynamics are also studied for achieving autonomy. Fulfillment of these requirements is necessary for the vehicle to demonstrate autonomous navigation and freight handling for SHOW (SHared automation Operating models for Worldwide adoption) H2020 project for delivering freight in an urban setting.

AB Autonomous ground vehicles are constantly exposed to matched/mismatched uncertainties and disturbances and different operating conditions. Consequently, robustness to resist the undesirable effect of changes in the nominal parameters of the vehicle is a significant provision for satisfactory path-tracking control of these vehicles. The accomplishment of lateral path-tracking control is an essential task expectable from autonomous ground vehicles, particularly during critical maneuvers, abrupt cornering, and lane changes at high speeds. This paper presents a new control approach based on immersion and invariance control theorem. The asymptotic stability of the proposed method is ensured and the adaptation laws for the parameters are derived based on the I&I stability theorem. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is confirmed for autonomous ground vehicles systems while making a double-lane-change at various forward speeds. The robustness of the proposed control method is evaluated under parametric uncertainties related to the autonomous ground vehicle and different road conditions. The obtained results suggest that the proposed control method holds the capacity to be applied effectively to the path-tracking task of autonomous ground vehicles under a broad range of operating conditions, parametric uncertainness, and external disturbances.

AB This paper presents a novel underwater vehicle for port area inspection, which has various navigation modes (towed mode, autonomous mode and kite mode) to stand against fast and changeable sea currents. The property assures safe and reliable observation performance irrespective of current speed. Since in a port area sea currents are fast and complex, such a vehicle must be practical and useful for port area application. The unique point of the vehicle is the employment of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) as a towed vehicle. In general, AUVs and towed vehicles are mutually contradictory. This paper describes the process of development to achieve the three different navigation modes. The system components and the results of computer simulations and towing tank tests to investigate the stability of the vehicle are presented. In addition, results of the first sea trial are also presented. These results show that the vehicle can navigate stably in the three different navigation modes.

AB This paper deals with algorithms for cooperative driving or flexible platooning of autonomous vehicles and experimental results on a test track. The cooperative driving, aiming at compatibility of safety and efficiency of road traffic, here implies the autonomous vehicles take such a formation as platooning including lane changing, overtaking, cutting-in, merging, and transitions between them. Each vehicle is equipped with a machine vision system for preceding vehicle detection, a laser radar for inter-vehicle gap measurement, the DGPS and the inter-vehicle communication function. The lateral control algorithm uses the DGPS localization data and maps. The longitudinal control algorithm is based on PD control with the inter-vehicle gap measurement. The autonomous vehicles drive with the headway of about 12 m at 40 km/h on a test track, while the following vehicle traces the same trajectory of the preceding one when not only lane following but also lane changing.

AB In the Industry 4.0 era, the automobile industry manufactures safe, reliable, Internet-enabled vehicles for usage by end users. This revolution is possible with the rapid advances in ICT, which are helping autonomous vehicles become a reality. Many leading manufacturing companies have developed autonomous vehicles keeping in view the future smart cities planning across the world. However, to make the autonomous vehicle a reality, several challenges, such as-software heterogeneity, real-time data analytics, verification and validation, and latency, need to be resolved. Among the aforementioned challenges, the latency issue requires careful attention so as to satisfy the needs of consumers, the manufacturing industry, and government regulations. In this direction, 5G-based testbeds across the globe are used by researchers with an aim to reduce the latency in autonomous vehicles. Thus, in this article, 5G-network-based non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is used to meet the stringent latency and reliability requirements of autonomous vehicles. Various challenges for implementation and usage of NOMA for future 5G-based applications are also discussed in the article.

AB Ensuring that autonomous vehicles do not cause accidents remains a challenge. We present a formal verification technique for guaranteeing legal safety in arbitrary urban traffic situations. Legal safety means that autonomous vehicles never cause accidents although other traffic participants are allowed to perform any behaviour in accordance with traffic rules. Our technique serves as a safety layer for existing motion planning frameworks that provide intended trajectories for autonomous vehicles. We verify whether intended trajectories comply with legal safety and provide fallback solutions in safety-critical situations. The benefits of our verification technique are demonstrated in critical urban scenarios, which have been recorded in real traffic. The autonomous vehicle executed only safe trajectories, even when using an intended trajectory planner that was not aware of other traffic participants. Our results indicate that our online verification technique can drastically reduce the number of traffic accidents.
   Recent accidents with autonomous test vehicles have eroded trust in such self-driving cars. A shift in approach is required to ensure autonomous vehicles can never be the cause of accidents. An online verification technique is presented that guarantees provably safe motions, including fallback solutions in safety-critical situations, for any intended trajectory calculated by the underlying motion planner.

AB We study a hierarchy of models based on kinetic equations for the descriptions of traffic flow in presence of autonomous and human-driven vehicles. The autonomous cars considered in this paper are thought of as ve-hicles endowed with some degree of autonomous driving which decreases the stochasticity of the drivers' behavior. Compared to the existing literature, we do not model autonomous cars as externally controlled vehicles. We investigate whether this feature is enough to provide a stabilization of traffic instabilities such as stop and go waves. We propose two indicators to quantify traffic insta-bility and we find, with analytical and numerical tools, that traffic instabilities are damped as the penetration rate of the autonomous vehicles increases.

AB Research on autonomous vehicles has hitherto been largely concerned with its technological infrastructure, and with the management of smart transport systems in urban space. While there is a growing body of work on the sociological perspectives of autonomous vehicles, it has tended to remain technocentric, focusing on how self-driving innovations have an effect on cities and urban lives. By thinking through the notions of sensation, action, and encounter, this paper advances a reconceptualisation of autonomous vehicles that better accounts for human agency and sentience in an increasingly automated urban world. More broadly, this paper seeks to illuminate the emergent and creative potential of urban life to unsettle and complicate the taken-for-granted power of smart and autonomous technologies in enacting urban transformations.

AB In this paper, a novel dynamics controller for autonomous vehicle to simultaneously control it to the driving limits and follow the desired path is proposed. The dynamics controller consists of longitudinal and lateral controllers. In longitudinal controller, the G-G diagram is utilized to describe the driving and handling limits of the vehicle. The accurate G-G diagram is obtained based on phase plane approach and a nonlinear vehicle dynamic model with accurate tyre model. In lateral controller, the tyre cornering stiffness is estimated to improve the robustness of the controller. The stability analysis of the closed-looped error dynamics shows that the controller remains stable against parameters uncertainties in extreme condition such as tyre saturation. Finally, an electric autonomous Formula race car developed by the authors is used to validate the proposed controller. The autonomous driving experiment on an oval race track shows the efficiency and robustness of the proposed controller. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A Novel Lane Change Decision-Making Model of Autonomous Vehicle Based on

   Bayesian optimization; drivers' habits
AB Autonomous driving is a crucial issue of the automobile industry, and research on lane change is its significant part. Previous works on the autonomous vehicle lane change mainly focused on lane change path planning and path tracking, but autonomous vehicle lane change decision making is rarely mentioned. Therefore, this paper establishes an autonomous lane change decision-making model based on benefit, safety, and tolerance by analyzing the factors of the autonomous vehicle lane change. Then, because of the multi-parameter and non-linearity of the autonomous lane change decision-making process, a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm with the Bayesian parameters optimization is adopted to solve this problem. Finally, we compare a lane change model based on rules with the proposed SVM model in the test set, and results illustrate that the SVM model performs better than the rule-based lane change model. Moreover, the real car experiment is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the decision model.

AB Autonomous vehicle technology and its enabled mobility services are evolving at a more rapid pace than the understanding of the infrastructure required for them to be efficiently and safely implemented. This has not been systematically investigated in literature or practice. This research makes exploratory efforts to investigate this research area by examining and evaluating the infrastructure requirements needed to support autonomous vehicles. It formulates an infrastructure change guideline and an evaluation framework to prioritise the safety, efficiency and accessibility when integrating autonomous vehicles alongside conventional vehicles and multimodal users such as public transport commuters and pedestrians. The case study results show that for different type of regions, being a regional commercial and transportation hub in a residential area and a regional CBD street in a multimodal and spatially limited area, different arrangement and trade-offs can be made. Promisingly, the proposed guideline and framework work sufficiently, and serve as a first step towards a more systematic guideline for autonomous vehicle integration. The outcome of the research consists of a review of approaches that can guide urban planners and other users to understand and prioritise the implementation of autonomous vehicles.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have the ability to enhance traffic flow and road safety by significantly reducing human error. Although some collision risks may be eliminated in autonomous vehicles, other potential risks remain, especially at on-ramp merging areas. This paper proposes a collision avoidance model for on-ramp merging of autonomous vehicles under different scenarios. Simulation results suggest that the proposed method can reduce the risks of collision at on-ramp merging areas. Moreover, we assessed the effectiveness of the strategy in terms of traffic flow speed variations with different penetration rates of CAVs. Results show that the collision avoidance strategy leads to lower speed variations. This study reveals that the information obtained from the proposed collision avoidance model could be helpful for improving traffic safety and enhancing urban mobility.

ID STRATEGIES
AB Autonomous vehicle platoons are a promising solution to road safety, efficient road utilization, emission reduction, among other problems facing today's transportation industry. However, consistently maintaining the desired inter-vehicle distance is one of the major problems facing autonomous vehicle platoons. In this study, we propose a proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-based cost-efficient algorithm to control the longitudinal inter-vehicle distance between successive members of an autonomous vehicle platoon. In our approach, calculations of the control algorithm are decentralized, and the data used in the control algorithm is obtained using one sensor per platoon member making the algorithm cost-efficient both computationally and financially. The proposed algorithm was implemented using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and applied to 3D vehicle models in simulations designed to mimic the natural environment in order to demonstrate and evaluate the suitability of the proposed algorithm for demanding and applicable scenarios. We performed meticulous simulations using the ROS framework in conjunction with the gazebo platform. In the proposed approach, the desired inter-vehicle distance between platoon members was successfully kept with a maximum absolute error of 5 m under any given scenario at any given time while maintaining platoon formation and ensuring that no collisions occur among platoon members.

AB In this paper, a real-time path-planning algorithm that provides an optimal path for off-road autonomous driving with static obstacles avoidance is presented. The proposed planning algorithm computes a path based on a set of predefined waypoints. The predefined waypoints provide the base frame of a curvilinear coordinate system to generate path candidates for autonomous vehicle path planning. Each candidate is converted to a Cartesian coordinate system and evaluated using obstacle data. To select the optimal path, the priority of each path is determined by considering the path safety cost, path smoothness, and path consistency. The proposed path-planning algorithms were applied to the autonomous vehicle A1, which won the 2010 Autonomous Vehicle Competition organized by the Hyundai-Kia Automotive Group in Korea.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technologies are expected to improve the quality of intersection operations through Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and Infrastructure-to-Vehicle (I2V) communications. This study investigates mobility and environmental impacts of CAVs on signalized intersections. With I2V communication capability, CAVs are able to receive the real-time traffic signal information while approaching the intersections. A speed control strategy for CAVs is developed and optimal speeds for CAVs are calculated based on their locations and signal conditions. The analysis is conducted in a mixed traffic environment with combination of regular vehicles, autonomous vehicles, and CAVs. The vehicle delay and emissions at the selected intersection are quantified with respect to different market penetration rates of CAVs. The results indicate that CAVs can reduce vehicle delay by as much as 46.06% and 33.47% in emissions compared to regular vehicles. The proposed strategy can effectively improve the mobility and environment at signalized intersections.

AB A scenario vehicle in autonomous driving simulations is a dynamic entity that is expected to perform trustworthy bidirectional interaction tasks with the autonomous vehicle under test. Modeling interactive behavior can not only facilitate better prediction of human drivers' intentions and motions but also be valuable in generating more human-like decisions and trajectories for autonomous vehicle testing. However, simulations of most of the available scenario vehicles on existing platforms behave conservatively. This study summarizes five driving motivations based on human-need theories of multiple psychologists, namely safety, dominance, achievement, order, and relatedness, and organizes the framework using a behavior tree. The proposed model generates different driving behaviors by simulating the changing psychological needs of human drivers during vehicle operation. Using a self-developed two-dimensional simulator, experiments were conducted by considering multiple scenarios in urban, rural, and highway road sections. The obtained results indicate that the scenario vehicles controlled by the proposed model exhibit a significant interactive nature, facilitating proactive communication rather than providing simple responses.

AB Interaction between drivers and pedestrians is often facilitated by informal communicative cues, like hand gestures, facial expressions, and eye contact. In the near future, however, when semi- and fully autonomous vehicles are introduced into the traffic system, drivers will gradually assume the role of mere passengers, who are casually engaged in non-driving-related activities and, therefore, unavailable to participate in traffic interaction. In this novel traffic environment, advanced communication interfaces will need to be developed that inform pedestrians of the current state and future behavior of an autonomous vehicle, in order to maximize safety and efficiency for all road users. The aim of the present review is to provide a comprehensive account of empirical work in the field of external human-machine interfaces for autonomous vehicle-to-pedestrian communication. In the great majority of covered studies, participants clearly benefited from the presence of a communication interface when interacting with an autonomous vehicle. Nevertheless, standardized interface evaluation procedures and optimal interface specifications are still lacking.

An autonomous vehicle driving comfort is mainly determined by the control algorithm of the vehicle. If the passenger's comfort is initially predicted based on acceleration and deceleration limits, the control strategy algorithm can be adjusted, which would be helpful to improve ride comfort in autonomous vehicles. We implement numerical analysis of the control strategy, ensuring reduced jerk conditions. In addition, backward propagation was applied to estimate the braking force limits of the regenerative braking systems more accurately. The developed algorithm was verified through the Car Sim and MATLAB/Simulink simulations by comparing them with the conventional braking system. The proposed CRBS offers effective regenerative braking within limits and ensures increased driving comfort to passengers.

AB (1) Background: The automation of transport systems is well underway; however, it is unclear how this will affect people's mobility choices. Changes in these choices have implications for health and the sustainability and efficiency of transport systems, making it important to understand how the advent of autonomous vehicles might affect people's transport behaviors. The aim of the present study was to address this knowledge gap in the Australian context. (2) Methods: Respondents reported their demographic information, current transport behaviors, the perceived importance of transport-related factors, and attitudes toward autonomous vehicles. They then read a vignette describing a future scenario involving autonomous vehicles that was informed by expert stakeholders. After reading the vignette, the respondents selected those transport options that they would anticipate using in the depicted scenario. Descriptive analyses were conducted to examine changes in transport choices, while regression models were employed to identify the predictors of choices in the future scenario. (3) Results: Most respondents envisaged making greater use of active, shared, and public transport options in an autonomous future, compared to their current use of these options. The intended use of private transport options halved. The most consistent predictor for selecting a certain mode of transport was the current use of that option or its non-autonomous equivalent. (4) Conclusion: Overall, favorable changes in the envisaged use of transport were observed for the hypothetical scenario, which was characterized by improved public transport, a practical active transport infrastructure, and relatively cheap shared autonomous vehicles. If policymakers can act to realize these outcomes, the autonomation of transport is likely to lead to positive societal change.

AB This study estimates Korea's connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) industry's economic impact using a multiple-stage input-output (I-O) analysis. To overcome the rough and arbitrary industry matching process of traditional I-O analysis, we designed a modified I-O analysis that can estimate the Korean CAV industry's economic impact with a sophisticated and reasonable range of values by introducing a new, elaborate mapping stage. We estimated the economic impacts of the CAV industry in various ways through the evolution of CAV technology (autonomous vehicle and automated vehicle). The results show that full adoption and commercialization of CAV will transform the current automotive industry, which tends to be a final demand manufacturing industry, into an intermediate-demand manufacturing industry. These results empirically support previous studies demonstrating that CAV can be combined with mobility as a service (MaaS).

AB This study examines the perceptions of concerns and benefits surrounding autonomous road vehicles deployed for public transport, their relationships with public acceptance, and what the public prefers during its implementation. Surveying 210 participants in Singapore, we found a general acceptance of the deployment of autonomous road public transport in Singapore with agreement that introducing them would be beneficial, particularly in improving public transport reliability and accessibility. However, they reported concerns in the areas of technical-related issues and legal liability. Participants who perceived greater benefits were also likely to report greater acceptance, even after taking into account their concerns and sociodemographic backgrounds. Participants also reported preferences for human operators to continue playing an active role, the government to test the autonomous vehicles extensively before making them available for public use and greater clarity on the legal liability when accidents involving autonomous vehicles occur when autonomous road public transport is eventually implemented.

AB Achieving high-level, anthropomorphic lane-changing control for autonomous vehicles is an important method for promoting the safe and efficient operation of autonomous vehicles. According to existing lane-changing models, the important phenomenon that frequent acceleration and deceleration cause a poor riding experience and thus induce the intention of lane-changing needs to be given more attention. In this study, a discretionary lane-changing control method for autonomous vehicles is designed based on anti-interference ability (AIA, where AIA is the number of decelerations per unit time of an autonomous vehicle) to extract the traffic flow variation characteristics of autonomous vehicles with AIA and to determine methods to improve the driving efficiency and stability of autonomous vehicles. AIA is introduced to the lane-changing decision-making process of autonomous vehicles to simulate the phenomenon of lane -changing intention caused by poor riding experience. A control model that can evaluate the lane-changing conditions is then proposed. NetLogo software was selected to construct a one-way, two-lane scenario for autonomous vehicle operation, and the impacts of the proposed decision-making method in each scenario were tested. The experimental results show that autonomous vehicles are more likely to produce frequent deceleration behaviors under large-traffic and small-space operating conditions. A traffic flow composed of autonomous vehicles that use AIA to induce lane-changing intentions has a more obvious phase transition process. An autonomous vehicle whose AIA induces lane-changing intention can improve the speed and stability for a certain traffic volume (a saturation of less than approximately 0.45). Although lane-changing behavior breaks the stable state of two-lane traffic flow, it will also successfully suppress the aggravation of traffic congestion. Lane-changing has an impact on the local oscillation of traffic flow, and a stable traffic flow operation state and reduction in the AIA clearing frequency are mutually reinforcing.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB To simultaneously enable multiple autonomous driving services on affordable embedded systems, we designed and implemented LoPECS, a Low-Power Edge Computing System for real-time autonomous robots and vehicles services. The contributions of this paper are three-fold: first, we developed a Heterogeneity-Aware Runtime Layer to fully utilize vehicle's heterogeneous computing resources to fulfill the real-time requirement of autonomous driving applications; second, we developed a vehicle-edge Coordinator to dynamically offload vehicle tasks to edge cloudlet to further optimize user experience in the way of prolonged battery life; third, we successfully integrated these components into LoPECS system and implemented it on Nvidia Jetson TX1. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first complete edge computing system in a production autonomous vehicle. Our implementation on Nvidia Jetson demonstrated that it could successfully support multiple autonomous driving services with only 11 W of power consumption, and hence proves the effectiveness of the proposed LoPECS system.

AB Autonomous driving vehicles can reduce congestion and improve safety while increasing traffic efficiency. To reflect the quality of driving more comprehensively, the driving safety, efficiency, and occupant comfort should be jointly optimized for autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, in order to cope with complicated traffic environments and achieve satisfactory driving performance, a powerful behavior decision-making module is indispensable for autonomous vehicles. Toward this end, we study a reinforcement-learning (RL)-based method to intelligently make the behavior decision in this article. A Markov decision process (MDP) model is first formulated with a comprehensive reward function, including the effects of driving safety, efficiency, and comfort. The knowledge of the surrounding vehicles is also leveraged to exploit the behavior prediction of the target vehicle. We then propose a behavior decision strategy based on the actor-critic (AC) mechanism, which can efficiently learn both a Gaussian policy function and a linear value function. Finally, the real traffic data are used to build up the simulations for evaluating the performances of the proposed method thoroughly. Simulation results show that our proposed method can significantly reduce the collision rate for autonomous vehicles.

AB IntroductionAutonomous vehicles can have social attributes and make ethical decisions during driving. In this study, we investigated the impact of human-vehicle moral matching on trust in autonomous vehicles and its mechanism. MethodsA 2*2 experiment involving 200 participants was conducted. ResultsThe results of the data analysis show that utilitarian moral individuals have greater trust than deontological moral individuals. Perceived value and perceived risk play a double-edged role in people's trust in autonomous vehicles. People's moral type has a positive impact on trust through perceived value and a negative impact through perceived risk. Vehicle moral type moderates the impact of human moral type on trust through perceived value and perceived risk. DiscussionThe conclusion shows that heterogeneous moral matching (people are utilitarian, vehicles are deontology) has a more positive effect on trust than homogenous moral matching (both people and vehicles are deontology or utilitarian), which is consistent with the assumption of selfish preferences of individuals. The results of this study provide theoretical expansion for the fields related to human-vehicle interaction and AI social attributes and provide exploratory suggestions for the functional design of autonomous vehicles.

ID A-RIDE PROBLEM
AB We investigate a new form of car-sharing system that can be introduced in the market for autonomous vehicles called fractional ownership or co-ownership. Although dynamic ride sharing provides ad hoc shared mobility services without any long-term commitment, we consider co-ownership programs with which users can still "own" a car with committed usage and ownership. We assume that an autonomous vehicle is shared by a group of users, which is only accessible by the group. We use stable matching to help users find an appropriate group with which to share an autonomous vehicle and present a generalized stable matching model that allows flexible sizes of groups as well as various alternative objectives. We also present a heuristic algorithm to improve computational time owing to the combinatorial properties of the problem.

AB Autonomous vehicles are a rising technology in the near future to provide a safe and efficient transportation experience. Vehicular communication systems are indispensable components in autonomous vehicles to share road conditions in a wireless manner. With the exponential increase of traffic data, conventional wireless technologies preliminarily show their incompetence because of limited bandwidth. This article explores the capability of millimeter-wave communications for autonomous vehicles. As the next-generation wireless technology, mmWave is advanced in its multi-gigabit transmittability and beamforming technique. Based on these features, we propose the novel design of a vehicular mmWave system combining the advantages of the Internet of Things and cloud computing. This mmWave system supports vehicles sharing multi-gigabit data about the surrounding environment and recognizing objects via the cloud in real time. Therefore, autonomous vehicles are able to determine the optimal driving strategy instantaneously.

AB Autonomous vehicles are predicted to enter the commercial passenger vehicle market soon. Being a new technology, there is significant uncertainty surrounding its performance, adaptations by users, and influence on the wider transport and energy systems. In this uncertainty are several possibilities for autonomous vehicle technology to underdeliver on its promise of safety, efficiency, and flexibility; and, instead, become a net burden on society. The aim of this study is to develop insights into the medium- and long-term impacts of autonomous vehicles adoption on the use-stage greenhouse gas emissions. In the study, a System Dynamics approach was applied to develop a stock-and-flow model that simulates the technological intervention of replacing a conventional vehicle with an autonomous vehicle under scenarios related to vehicle adoption, induced vehicle demand, vehicle fleet turnover, vehicle ownership, vehicle efficiency, and the energy-supply greenhouse gas intensity. The results indicate that the internal-combustion-engine vehicle fuel efficiency and the electricity-supply greenhouse gas intensity have the largest influence on decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, but that the benefits can be negated by inefficient autonomous vehicles and induced demand. Based on these insights, recommendations to manufacturers include minimising energy consumption and adopting low-greenhouse gas vehicle technologies. Recommendations to governments include managing vehicle travel speeds, incentivising ride-sharing, and continuing support of renewable electricity supply. Shared recommendations include co-planning and preparing for data collection and reporting by autonomous vehicles, themselves, to support the facilitation of a low-greenhouse gas transition. The suggested future work focusses on developing the model, possibly in conjunction with other methods and tools, to support further exploration of other greenhouse gas emitting processes.

TI The Backseat Control Architecture for Autonomous Robotic Vehicles: A

SO MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL

DT Article
DE Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV); Marine robotics; Autonomy
AB In this paper, an innovative hybrid control architecture for real-time control of autonomous robotic vehicles is described as well as its implementation on a commercially available autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). This architecture has two major components, a behavior-based intelligent autonomous controller and an interface to a classical dynamic controller that is responsible for real-time dynamic control of the vehicle given the decisions of the intelligent controller over the decision state space (e.g., vehicle course, speed, and depth). The driving force behind the development of this architecture was a desire to make autonomy software development for underwater vehicles independent from the dynamic control specifics of any given vehicle. The resulting software portability allows significant code reuse and frees autonomy software developers from being tied to a particular vehicle manufacturer's autonomy software and support as long as the vehicle supports the required interface between the intelligent controller and the dynamic controller. This paper will describe in detail the components of the backseat driver architecture as implemented on the Iver2 underwater vehicle, provide several examples of its use, and discuss the future direction of the architecture.

ID OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE
AB The underwater environment introduces many limitations that must be faced when designing an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). One of the most important issues is developing an effective vehicle movement control and mission planning system. This article presents a global trajectory planning system based on a multimodal approach. The trajectory of the vehicle's movement has been divided into segments between introduced waypoints and calculated in parallel by advanced path planning methods: modified A* method, artificial potential field (APF), genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimisation (PSO), and rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT). The shortest paths in each planned segment are selected and combined to give the resulting trajectory. A comparison of the results obtained by the proposed approach with the path calculated by each method individually confirms the increase in the system's effectiveness by ensuring a shorter trajectory and improving the system's reliability. Expressing the final trajectory in the form of geographical coordinates with a specific arrival time allows the implementation of calculation results in mission planning for autonomous underwater vehicles used commercially and in the military, as well as for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) equipped with trajectory tracking control systems.

AB In the development of autonomous vehicles, the main focus of sensor research has been in relation to environmental perception, and only minimal work has focused on the human-vehicle interaction perspective. However, human factors need to be considered to ensure the safe operation of partially autonomous vehicles. This study briefly introduces a design methodology for the takeover request (TOR) time in National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Level 3 vehicles and compares four different TORs in a simulated environment based on human-in-the-loop experiments with various driving scenarios. A total of 30 drivers participated in the study, and the quantitative/qualitative data obtained show statistically significant differences between the four TOR thresholds. This study shows that the timing involved in the takeover can be obtained by using a performance-based approach considering human factors.

AB Several highway design elements are presently determined based on constraints due to human drivers. Autonomous vehicles (AV) are expected to replace human drivers with an expectation of having differing driving characteristics. It is, therefore, imperative that current infrastructure is reassessed for AV scenarios. This paper proposes a raycasting approach to test autonomous vehicles (AV) in a virtual environment using voxelated LiDAR data. Sight distances and speed limits are mapped based on AV and road characteristics. An alternative algorithm was used in order to compare it with the proposed approach and was found to produce results agreeing within 1.94%. It was found that certain AV scenarios may lead to unsafe driving conditions for autonomous vehicles. Such information is crucial as it allows policymakers to design maps, guidelines, legislation, and countermeasures to prevent unsafe driverless vehicle scenarios.

AB Autonomous vehicles contain many sensors, enabling them to drive by themselves. Autonomous vehicles need to communicate with other vehicles (V2V) wirelessly and with infrastructures (V2I) like satellites with diverse connections as well, to implement safety, reliability, and efficiency. Information transfer from remote communication appliances is a critical task and should be accomplished quickly, in real time and with maximum reliability. A message that arrives late, arrives with errors, or does not arrive at all can create an unsafe situation. This study aims at employing data compression to efficiently transmit GNSS information to an autonomous vehicle or other infrastructure such as a satellite with maximum accuracy and efficiency. We developed a method for compressing NMEA data. Furthermore, our results were better than other ones in current studies, while supporting error tolerance and data omission.

AB The aim of the paper is to describe a multicriteria model predictive control method for autonomous vehicles at non-signalized intersections. The centralized controller aims to describe control action for each autonomous vehicle to guarantee collision free passage. At the same time, performances are defined for the centralized Model Predictive Controller, namely the minimization of traveling time and energy consumption. Since these control goals are often conflicting, a scheduling variable is introduced to create a balance between them. Hence, the centralized controller can be tuned based on the importance of each control goal, which can be useful in urban environment where traffic densities may vary heavily depending on the period of the day. The effectiveness of the proposed centralized multicriteria controller is demonstrated through a complex simulation example in CarSim simulation environment using different tpye of autonomous vehicles.

AB Nowadays, the use of autonomous surface vehicles has increased in popularity. Autonomous surface vehicles can be adapted to perform water quality measurements, water contamination and hazards detection, garbage collection, aquatic animal population control, shore control, and other applications. This paper shows the novel construction of a small solar-powered autonomous surface vehicle. The vehicle was manufactured of composite materials of natural origin. It was equipped with an electric engine powered by ultralight photovoltaic panel, and a set of sensors and actuators used for autonomous operation and measurements of such factors, as pH, turbidity, purity, and oxygen content in water. The investigations carried out have been divided into three main parts. First, the geometry of the proposed autonomous surface vehicle was modelled using computational fluid dy-namics and optimal shape of hull and deck was determined. Then, a dedicated construction of the photovoltaic panel was developed and tested under real conditions. The maximum power generated was 41.7 W when solar radiation was 850 W/m2. The matched power related to the area of 1 m2 was higher by 9.7% - 34.3% compared to other tested market-available panels. Finally, simulations in the TRNSYS software were carried out to determine the operational parameters of the developed autonomous surface vehicle under different operating scenarios. Simulations showed that the operation scenario of the autonomous surface vehicle significantly affects its primary energy consumption due to the energy supplied from the grid to recharge the system after each day of operation. The change in location can increase the primary energy savings, since among the investigated loca-tions the primary energy saving ratio varied between about 30 and 50%. The analysis pointed out that the developed construction of the solar-powered small autonomous surface vehicle is a really promising solution and can be considered as an addition or replacement to the actual available water quality monitoring systems.

AB This paper presents an approach to develop an intelligent master-slave system between agricultural vehicles, which will enable a semi-autonomous agricultural vehicle (slave) to follow a leading tractor (master) with a given lateral and longitudinal offset. In our study not only the follow-up motions but also the site-specific control of the apparatus such as rear and front power lift was considered. In the first part of this paper, the recent research works in the area autonomous farming were discussed and the restrictions of these research works were illustrated. In the second part an approach, to construct a master-slave system between two agricultural vehicles was demonstrated. In the next part, the mathematic modeling of this master-slave system and the simulation results about the control algorithm were demonstrated. Afterwards, the result of a real field test was presented and the safety considerations about such an intelligent vehicle system were made.

While generational differences have always existed, millennials have distinctive qualities that are intrinsically embedded into their behavior. Using an exploratory survey, this study examines general sentiments regarding the various elements of AV technology. The results indicate that while both millennial and non millennial generation cohorts indeed share common sentiments toward AVs, a majority of the issues presented by this study show an ultimate dichotomy between the two generational cohorts.

AB Featured Application Autonomous Driving. While detecting surrounding vehicles in autonomous driving is possible with advances in object detection using deep learning, there are cases where small vehicles are not being detected accurately. Additionally, real-time processing requirements must be met for implementation in autonomous vehicles. However, detection accuracy and execution speed have an inversely proportional relationship. To improve the accuracy-speed tradeoff, this study proposes an ensemble method. An input image is downsampled first, and the vehicle detection result is acquired for the downsampled image through an object detector. Then, warping or upsampling is performed on the Region of Interest (RoI) where the small vehicles are located, and the small vehicle detection result is acquired for the transformed image through another object detector. If the input image is downsampled, the effect on the detection accuracy of large vehicles is minimal, but the effect on the detection accuracy of small vehicles is significant. Therefore, the detection accuracy of small vehicles can be improved by increasing the pixel sizes of small vehicles in the transformed image more than the given input image. To validate the proposed method's efficiency, the experiment was conducted with Argoverse vehicle data used in an autonomous vehicle contest, and the accuracy-speed tradeoff improved by up to a factor of two using the proposed ensemble method.

ID PILOT BEHAVIOR
AB Autonomous driving has been the subject of increased interest in recent years both in industry and in academia. Serious efforts are being pursued to address legal, technical, and logistical problems and make autonomous cars a viable option for everyday transportation. One significant challenge is the time and effort required for the verification and validation of the decision and control algorithms employed in these vehicles to ensure a safe and comfortable driving experience. Hundreds of thousands of miles of driving tests are required to achieve a well calibrated control system that is capable of operating an autonomous vehicle in an uncertain traffic environment where interactions among multiple drivers and vehicles occur simultaneously. Traffic simulators where these interactions can be modeled and represented with reasonable fidelity can help to decrease the time and effort necessary for the development of the autonomous driving control algorithms by providing a venue where acceptable initial control calibrations can be achieved quickly and safely before actual road tests. In this paper, we present a game theoretic traffic model that can be used to: 1) test and compare various autonomous vehicle decision and control systems and 2) calibrate the parameters of an existing control system. We demonstrate two example case studies, where, in the first case, we test and quantitatively compare two autonomous vehicle control systems in terms of their safety and performance, and, in the second case, we optimize the parameters of an autonomous vehicle control system, utilizing the proposed traffic model and simulation environment.

AB Autonomous vehicle moral dilemmas matter less for the particular outcomes of potential accidents than for their role in defining the values of the society we wish to live in. Different approaches have been suggested to determine the ethical settings that autonomous vehicles should be implemented in and identify the legitimate agents for making such decisions. Most of these, however, fail on theoretical grounds, facing severe issues related to moral justifications and compliance to the law, or on practical grounds, being insufficiently universal, action-guiding, or technically viable to be implemented. The analogy with the "trolley problem" has been extensively discussed. However, researchers have rarely tried to adapt this framework to autonomous vehicle cases or investigate how it could be used to address these issues. In doing so, this paper aims to answer the two key problems of autonomous vehicle dilemmas. With regards to the decision-maker, it rejects autonomous vehicle users' choice-based models, showing the absurdity of both switch of control and adaptative preferences and arguing for common legislator-determined ethical settings. With regards to the decisions themselves, it criticizes both utilitarian views and those based on individuals' criteria to suggest a deontologist rights-based approach. This allows for the defence of a morally coherent, regulatory compliant, explainable, and easily implementable framework capable of addressing all autonomous vehicle moral dilemma scenarios present in the literature.

AB Technical innovations in vehicles continually influence the transportation transition. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are one of the innovations. Connected and electric vehicle technologies are considered to be the development directions of AVs. This paper aims to understand consumer attitudes towards autonomous, connected, and electric vehicles (ACEVs), using data collected through a survey in China. The results indicate that respondents found the potential for environmental-friendly transport, increased accessibility of travel for non-drivers, and reduced driving fatigue as the most attractive aspects of ACEVs. Conversely, respondents were most concerned about vehicle safety, legal liability, and charging issues. It is implicated that battery service life, driving mileage, and charging are prominent barriers to the adoption of ACEVs. The perceived benefits and related infrastructure improvements show positive effects on respondents' willingness to adopt ACEVs, while concerns and cost reduce their appeal.

AB This paper deals with the problem of automatic path-following control for a class of autonomous vehicle systems with parametric uncertainties and external disturbances in cross-country conditions. In the unstructured environments, the unevenness, the discontinuity and the variability of the terrain greatly increase the parametric uncertainties and the external perturbations of autonomous vehicles. To overcome these difficulties, a novel automatic path-following control scheme of vision-based autonomous vehicles is presented by utilizing the guaranteed-cost control theory. First, a new road detection algorithm used for segmenting and extracting the traversable path in unstructured terrains is achieved by using a combination consisting of multiple sensors, and the local relative position information between the vehicles and the desired trajectories can be acquired by the proposed detected algorithm in real time. Then, an optimal guaranteed-cost path-following control system is proposed, which can deal with the parametric uncertainties of autonomous vehicles and ensure the stability of the closed-loop control system. Finally, both simulation tests and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed control scheme can guarantee high path-tracking accuracy irrespective of the parametric uncertainties.

ID CHALLENGES
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology that has gained a huge user base by facilitating Internet-connected devices being used in numerous applications including smart vehicular infrastructure. In this context, we focus on the traditional vehicular ad hoc network that has evolved into a new perception called the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), and is expected to soon transform into the Internet of Autonomous Vehicles (IoAV). IoAV hopes to facilitate smart vehicular infrastructure and autonomous driving without the need for human involvement. However, as the number of connected vehicles keeps increasing, so does the need for autonomous decision making. Hence, the IoAV must provide robust, secure, seamless, and scalable communication among the vehicles as well as the roadside units. This article provides an overview of autonomous vehicle communication layers, its associated properties, and security threats. Further, this article also briefly discusses the current research trends and future research issues.

The control system is responsible for ensure the autonomous behavior of this kind of vehicle. Currently, unconventional strategies are used to control AUV's, because of the advantages they offer. The present article presents the methodology design for the slider and the results it offers for the autonomous underwater vehicle HRC-AUV developed by the Robotics and Automation Group Perception (GARP). Control of direction in sliding mode is designed from the model 3 DOF nonlinear dynamics defining HRC-AUV in the horizontal plane. This design simulation is evaluated by using a solution to reduce the undesirable effect of the chattering.

AB Autonomous vehicles have to share the road with human-driven ones for a prolonged period in the near future. Thus, they should have the ability to understand the lane changing intentions of surrounding human-driven vehicles. Unlike human drivers, the state-of-the-art models used in autonomous vehicles recognize a driver's lane changing intention based on the target vehicle's lateral movement, which leaves little to no time for the autonomous vehicle to react. In this paper, a Human-like Lane Changing Intention Understanding Model (HLCIUM) for autonomous driving is proposed to understand the lane changing intentions of surrounding vehicles. By imitating the selective attention mechanism of human vision systems, the proposed model emulates the way human drivers concentrate on the surrounding vehicles and recognizes their lane changing intentions accordingly. The velocity changes of the surrounding vehicles are treated as the lane changing hints, and the attention is drawn to the corresponding vehicle following a saliency-based scheme. Then, the lane changing intention is identified by a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based intention recognizer. The proposed model is tested with Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) vehicle trajectory dataset, and the proposed method has reached 90.89% in detecting lane changing intention and 88.58% in lane keeping in urban road scenarios, and reached 87.73% and 87.48% for the lane changing and lane keeping intentions in highway scenarios, respectively. Importantly, the average recognition time before the lane changing maneuver of the proposed model is 6.67 seconds for the urban road datasets and 7.08 seconds for the highway datasets, which is far earlier than state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, the proposed method shows efficiency and robustness in complex real urban traffic datasets, which is ideal to use in human-like autonomous driving systems.

AB The involvement of autonomous underwater vehicles for patrolling, monitoring or maintenance activities of submersed structures in the coastal strip, harbors or in proximity of off-shore plants (e.g. in oil& gas and military fields), can represent a high benefit for the economy of the related areas. For instance, continuous or more frequent monitoring can be possible, with a reduction of the necessary costs: The use of remotely operated vehicles with the linked implication of support ships and specialized pilots, or the involvement of professional divers, could be avoided or significantly reduced. The paper describes the FeelHippo autonomous underwater vehicles, the vehicle designed and built by the MDM Lab of the University of Florence; it is a low cost autonomous underwater vehicles suitable for these purposes. In particular, an onboard acoustic localization system, based on a low cost approach, has been implemented and preliminary experimental results are here reported.

AB This paper proposes an optimal path planning algorithm to make the autonomous vehicle follow the desired path profile while avoiding nearby obstacles safely. Also, it utilizes only readily available sensors equipped with typical autonomous vehicle system. For optimal path planning, an artificial potential field (APF) algorithm to derive both desired vehicle longitudinal velocity and desired vehicle yaw angle in real time is newly designed, which includes both a repulsive field for avoiding road boundaries and nearby obstacles ahead, and an attractive field for following the proper lane. Next, the path tracking control algorithm consists of longitudinal and lateral motion controllers. Especially, a model predictive control (MPC) for vehicle lateral motion causes the yaw angle error between the desired path profile and the vehicle to approach zero. Then, it can derive an optimal front steering angle considering vehicle state and input constraints. Using CarSim and MATLAB/Simulink simulations, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in this paper is verified in some driving scenarios. Accordingly, its high performance for the path planning and tracking of autonomous vehicles can be clearly confirmed.

AB The majority of research efforts in the field of access control of autonomous vehicles at intersections are geared towards fully connected vehicles. The underlying assumptions for such efforts are active vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), infrastructure-to- vehicle (I2V) communications, and/or presence of a central controller. Though efficiency is proven to be significantly enhanced, the assumptions face inherent security and privacy obstacles and require high infrastructure costs. In previous work, the authors designed and demonstrated a simpler, less costly, and more secure approach to autonomous vehicle management at intersections. The approach allows vehicles to make autonomous decisions at intersections based solely on sensing and/or beacon information with no V2V or V2I communications required. This article extends our model to account for various vehicle classes, all possible turns at the intersection with corresponding safe turning speeds, and various intersection geometries. Compared to a fully actuated signal controller, the proposed and improved model is again proven operationally more efficient, as it reduced the average delay per vehicle by at least 21% and up to 51% for the various simulated scenarios. After 40 million seconds of simulation, the proposed model proved collision free operations.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to shape urban life and significantly modify travel behaviors. "Autonomous technology" means technology that can drive a vehicle without active physical control or monitoring by a human operator. The first AV fleets are already in service in US cities. AVs offer a variety of automation, vehicle ownership, and vehicle use options. AVs could increase some health risks (such as air pollution, noise, and sedentarism); however, if proper regulated, AVs will likely reduce morbidity and mortality from motor vehicle crashes and may help reshape cities to promote healthy urban environments. Healthy models of AV use include fully electric vehicles in a system of ridesharing and ridesplitting. Public health will benefit if proper policies and regulatory frameworks are implemented before the complete introduction of AVs into the market.

AB In a mixed-traffic scenario where both autonomous vehicles and human-driving vehicles exist, a timely prediction of driving intentions of nearby human-driving vehicles is essential for the safe and efficient driving of an autonomous vehicle. In this paper, a driving intention prediction method based on hidden Markov model (HMM) is proposed for autonomous vehicles. HMMs representing different driving intentions are trained and tested with field collected data from a flyover. When training the models, either discrete or continuous characterization of the mobility features of vehicles is applied. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than the logistic regression (LR) method, and the HMMs trained with the continuous characterization of mobility features can give a higher prediction accuracy when they are used for predicting driving intentions. Moreover, when the surrounding traffic of the vehicle is taken into account, the performances of the proposed prediction method are further improved.

AB In the most of previous studies, social interactions between vehicles are not considered explicitly when designing decision making and motion planning module. Nevertheless, the strong interaction exists in the most of driving scenarios, especially in highway junction. This paper presents a game theoretic merging behavior control system for autonomous vehicle at on-ramp junction considering the interaction between the merging vehicle and following vehicle in the main lane. In this work, a driving style estimation is proposed to deal with the heterogeneity of driving style. Then we adopt a model predictive control (MPC) method to plan the optimal merging trajectory based on the game theoretic decision making result. Finally, simulation and Human-in-the-loop (HIL) experiment result shows the effectiveness of our approach in on-ramp merging scenario.

AB Predictive cruise control concerns designing controllers for autonomous vehicles using the broadcasted information from the traffic lights such that the idle time around the intersection can be reduced. This study proposes a novel adaptive optimal control approach based on reinforcement learning to solve the predictive cruise control problem of a platoon of connected and autonomous vehicles. First, the reference velocity is determined for each autonomous vehicle in the platoon. Second, a data-driven adaptive optimal control algorithm is developed to estimate the gains of the desired distributed optimal controllers without the exact knowledge of system dynamics. The obtained controller is able to regulate the headway, velocity, and acceleration of each vehicle in a suboptimal sense. The goal of trip time reduction is achieved without compromising vehicle safety and passenger comfort. Numerical simulations are presented to validate the efficacy of the proposed methodology.

AB Autonomous vehicles can be used to create realistic simulations of surrounding vehicles in driving simulators. However, the use of autonomous vehicles makes it difficult to ensure reproducibility between subjects. In this paper, an effort is made to solve the problem by combining autonomous vehicles and controlled events. A controlled event can be compared to a theatre play. The aim is to achieve the same initial play conditions for each subject, which can be problematic since the traffic situation around the subject will be dependent upon each subject's actions while driving in autonomous traffic. This paper presents an algorithm that achieves the transition from autonomous traffic to a predefined start condition for a play. The algorithm has been tested in the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute (VTI) driving simulator III with promising results. In most of the cases we examined the algorithm could reconstruct the specified start condition and conduct the transition from autonomous to controlled mode in a inconspicuous way. Some problems were observed regarding moving unwanted vehicles away from the closest area around the simulator vehicle, and this part of the algorithm has to be enhanced. The experiment also showed that the subjects drove faster in the presence of controlled everyday life traffic normally used in the VTI driving simulator than in autonomous traffic.

AB As the autonomous vehicles technology gradually enters the public eye, understanding consumers' psychological motivations for accepting autonomous vehicles is critical for the development of autonomous vehicles and society. Previously, researchers have explored the determinants of fully autonomous vehicles but the relevant research is far from enough. Moreover, the relationship between anthropomorphism and users' behavior has been ignored to a large extent. Therefore, this study aim to fill the gap by using anthropomorphism and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) to explore how system attributes (i.e., perceived anthropomorphism, perceived intelligence) and UTAUT attributes influence consumers' acceptance behavior. The data were collected via questionnaire survey conducted in Beijing, China, which can be a promising early adopter of AVs. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. The results reveal that perceived anthropomorphism and perceived intelligence have a direct positive influence on the adoption of AVs; performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions have an indirect positive influence on intention to adopt AVs. Also, this research contributes to the literature by enriching studies on psychological determinants of autonomous vehicles' adoption by taking an initial step to highlight anthropomorphism perceptions. This can provide managerial implications for policy-makers and businesses on how to effectively allocate resources to enhance autonomous vehicle adoption.

AB Convoy driving has great potential in the development of autonomous driving industry, which can bring great improvement to the utilization rate of roads and the travel experience of passengers. However, the emergence of convoy driving also brings some new challenges to the location privacy of autonomous vehicles. In this paper, a novel dynamic mixed zone establishment scheme is proposed to protect the location privacy of autonomous vehicles in convoy driving context. As the convoy is a closed group, the request for the establishment of the mix zone will be broadcast first within the convoy, followed by outside the convoy. In order to prevent pseudonym syntactic join attacks within the convoy, the proposed scheme allows autonomous vehicles to use multiple valid pseudonyms if only itself change the pseudonym in the convoy. In order to trace the real identity of the offending vehicle, the proposed scheme specifies the distribution method of the pseudonym, the legitimate vehicle can trace the real identity of the offending vehicle by submitting the pseudonym of the offending vehicle. Compared with the scheme to protect location privacy in the traditional vehicular network, the proposed scheme has less overhead and a higher level of security.

AB Autonomous cooperative driving systems require the integration of research activities in the field of embedded systems, robotics, communication, control and artificial intelligence in order to create a secure and intelligent autonomous drivers behaviour patterns in the traffic. Beside autonomous vehicle management, an important research focus is on the cooperation behaviour management. In this paper, we propose hybrid automaton modelling to emulate flexible vehicle Platoon and vehicles cooperation interactions. We introduce novel coding function for Platoon cooperation behaviour profile generation in time, which depends of vehicles number in Platoon and behaviour types. As the behaviour prediction of transportation systems, one of the primarily used methods of artificial intelligence in Intelligent Transport Systems, we propose an approach towards NARX neural network prediction of Platoon cooperation behaviour profile. With incorporation of Platoon manoeuvres dynamic prediction, which is capable of analysing traffic behaviour, this approach would be useful for secure implementation of real autonomous vehicles cooperation.

AB This paper describes the development of the H-infinity lateral control system for an autonomous ground vehicle operating a limited area using the RTK-DGPS (Real Time Kinematic-Differential Global Positioning System). Before engaging in autonomous driving, map data are acquired by the RTK-DGPS and used to construct a reference trajectory. The navigation system contains the map data and computes the reference yaw angle of the vehicle using two consecutive position values. The yaw angle of the vehicle is controlled by the H-infinity controller. A prototype of the autonomous vehicle by the navigation method has been developed, and the performance of the vehicle has been evaluated by experiment. The experimental results show that the H-infinity controller and the RTK-DGPS based navigation system can sufficiently track the map at low speed. We expect that this navigation system can be made more accurate by incorporating additional sensors.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AV) are likely to have profound effects on cities.?Using a?survey of regular commuters into the Adelaide CBD we investigate views on AV ownership, use, vehicle sharing and attachment to conventional vehicles. We then explore potential vehicle flow and land use change in the Adelaide CBD under two scenarios. Whilst the overall vehicle fleet reduces? under both scenarios, total trips may increase and some of the predicted benefits of AVs may not eventuate until a?lengthy transition period is complete. These findings have policy implications for how the transition to AVs is managed.

AB The oceans cover more than two-thirds of the planet, representing the vastest part of natural resources. Nevertheless, only a fraction of the ocean depths has been explored. Within this context, this article presents the H2020 ENDURUNS project that describes a novel scientific and technological approach for prolonged underwater autonomous operations of seabed survey activities, either in the deep ocean or in coastal areas. The proposed approach combines a hybrid Autonomous Underwater Vehicle capable of moving using either thrusters or as a sea glider, combined with an Unmanned Surface Vehicle equipped with satellite communication facilities for interaction with a land station. Both vehicles are equipped with energy packs that combine hydrogen fuel cells and Li-ion batteries to provide extended duration of the survey operations. The Unmanned Surface Vehicle employs photovoltaic panels to increase the autonomy of the vehicle. Since these missions generate a large amount of data, both vehicles are equipped with onboard Central Processing units capable of executing data analysis and compression algorithms for the semantic classification and transmission of the acquired data.

ID OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE; FRAMEWORK
AB In this paper, an optimal path-planning method is proposed for autonomous ground vehicles in case of overtaking a moving obstacle by the application of a two-phase optimal-control problem. When the autonomous vehicle detects a moving vehicle in a proper speed and distance ahead, it decides to overtake the obstacle by executing a double-lane change manoeuvre. The path for the overtaking manoeuvre is generated by a two-phase optimal path-planning problem. The cost function of the first phase is defined in such a way that the vehicle approaches the obstacle as close as possible. In the second phase, the cost function is defined as sum of the vehicle lateral deviation from the reference path and the rate of steering angle. At the same time, the lateral acceleration of the vehicle must not exceed a specified limit. The radio pseudo-spectral method, which is a method for direct trajectory optimization using global collocation at Legendre-Gauss-Radau points, is applied for solving the two-phase nonlinear optimal-control problem. A full nonlinear vehicle model in CarSim software is used for path-tracking simulation by importing path data from a MATLAB code. The simulation results show that the generated path for the autonomous vehicle satisfies all vehicle-dynamics constraints and hence is applicable for a real autonomous vehicle.

AB Maneuvering autonomous vehicles in constrained environments is not a trivial task. This paper concentrates in the practical maneuvering of electrical vehicles. The autonomous vehicles considered in the paper, ROMEO-3R and ROMEO-4R, have been developed at the University of Seville, Seville, Spain, as the result of the adaptation of a tricycle and a car-like conventional electrical vehicles for transportation of people, respectively. Moreover, maneuvering of ROMEO-4R backing up a trailer has also been considered. A particular maneuver, namely, autonomous parallel parking, has been used to illustrate the application of the presented methods to different electrical vehicles.

AB In this work, DonkieTown is introduced, an affordable and scalable platform for research on autonomous vehicles. The experimental framework was developed in the Robot Operative System (ROS). The platform integrates multiple small scale autonomous vehicles called Asinus Cars, which are equipped with at least a camera, odometer, and onboard computer. The vehicles are Differential Drive Robots (DDR), forced by software to behave as car-like vehicles. DonkieTown incorporates a low-cost localization system to provide the real-time vehicles' pose, by means of external cameras which detect ArUco markers, then Kalman Filters (KF) are used to track and estimate the pose of each vehicle. The platform includes a base station computer with a graphical interface for monitoring the system. DonkieTown also includes a series of algorithms to facilitate autonomous driving, such as communication, tracking, object detection, obstacle avoidance, control, trajectory tracking, etc. Moreover, a centralized vehicular network is implemented to allow communication between the agents and the base station, where the agents can share information about their state, obstacles, maneuver intentions, etc. To facilitate the research on autonomous cars in Latin America, the developed libraries are released as open source. Real-time experiments demonstrate the performance of DonkieTown in autonomous driving missions, such as following a lane while avoiding Donkey-like obstacles, and collaborative autonomous driving in convoy.

AB The autonomous ground vehicles have attracted a great deal of attention as viable solutions to a wide variety of military and civilian applications. However, the energy consumption plays a major role in the navigation of autonomous ground vehicles in challenging environments, especially if they are left to operate unattended under limited on-board power, such as planetary exploration, border patrol, etc. The autonomous ground vehicles are expected to perform more tasks more efficiently with limited power in these scenarios. Although plenty of research has developed an effective methodology for generating dynamically feasible and energy efficient trajectories for skid steering or differential steering vehicles, few studies on path planning for ackermann steering autonomous ground vehicles are available. In this study, an energy efficient path planning method with guarantee on completeness is proposed for autonomous ground vehicle with ackermann steering which is based on A* search algorithm. Firstly, the energy cost model is established for the autonomous ground vehicle using its kinematic constraints. Then, given the start and goal states, the energy-aware motion primitives are generated offline using the energy cost model to calculate the cost of each primary trajectory. Lastly, the energy efficient path planner is proposed and the analysis for completeness properties is given. The effectiveness of the proposed energy efficient path planner is verified by simulation over 150 randomly generated maps and real vehicle tests. The results show that a small increase in the distance of a path over the distance optimal path can result in a reduction of energy cost by nearly 26.9% in simulation and 21.09% in real test scenario for autonomous ground vehicles with ackermann steering.

AB In recent years, research and development of autonomous driving technology have gained much interest. Many autonomous driving frameworks have been developed in the past. However, building a safely operating fully functional autonomous driving framework is still a challenge. Several accidents have been occurred with autonomous vehicles, including Tesla and Volvo XC90, resulting in serious personal injuries and death. One of the major reasons is the increase in urbanization and mobility demands. The autonomous vehicle is expected to increase road safety while reducing road accidents that occur due to human errors. The accurate sensing of the environment and safe driving under various scenarios must be ensured to achieve the highest level of autonomy. This research presents Clothoid, a unified framework for fully autonomous vehicles, that integrates the modules of HD mapping, localization, environmental perception, path planning, and control while considering the safety, comfort, and scalability in the real traffic environment. The proposed framework enables obstacle avoidance, pedestrian safety, object detection, road blockage avoidance, path planning for single-lane and multi-lane routes, and safe driving of vehicles throughout the journey. The performance of each module has been validated in K-City under multiple scenarios where Clothoid has been driven safely from the starting point to the goal point. The vehicle was one of the top five to successfully finish the autonomous vehicle challenge (AVC) in the Hyundai AVC.

AB The rapid development of autonomous systems and Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) create new opportunities for maritime activities. Existing autonomous systems are becoming more powerful and utilise the capabilities of several types of devices such as Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) - sometimes referred as Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) -, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), moored and drifting systems and, recently emerging, autonomous vessels. Their importance in providing new services in maritime environments is undeniable and the opportunity for coordinated and interconnected operations is clear. However, continuous wide integration of various technologies in maritime environments still faces many challenges. Operations may take place in remote locations, so that dependence on third-party infrastructures such as satellite communication or terrestrial communication systems must be expected. The reliability, performance, availability, and cost of such systems are important issues that need to be tackled. This work reviews the major advancements on state-of-the-art autonomous maritime vehicles and systems, which are used in several different scenarios, from scientific research to transportation. Moreover, the paper highlights how available technologies can be composed in order to efficiently and effectively operate in maritime environments. Highlights of the trade-off between autonomy and communication requirements are provided and followed by an overview of promising communication and networking technologies that could encourage the integration of autonomous systems in maritime scenarios.

ID CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; TRAJECTORY DESIGN; RULES; CARS
AB Autonomous vehicles are expected to revolutionize the transportation industry. The goal of this research is to study the heterogeneity in traffic flow dynamics by comparing different penetration rates of four different types of vehicles: autonomous cars (AC), autonomous buses (AB), manual cars (MC), and manual buses (MB). For the purpose of this research, a modified cellular automata (CA) model is developed in order to analyze the effect of heterogeneous vehicles (manual and autonomous). Previously, studies have focused on manual and autonomous cars, but we believe a gap in perception and analysis of mixed traffic still exists, as inclusion of other modes of autonomous vehicle research is very limited. Therefore, we have explicitly examined the effect of the AB on overall traffic flow. Moreover, two types of lane changing behavior (aggressive lane changing and polite lane changing) were also integrated into the model. Multiple scenarios through different compositions of vehicles were simulated. As per the results, if AB is employed concurrently with AC, there will be a significant improvement in traffic flow and road capacity, as equally more passengers can be accommodated in AB as AC is also anticipated to be used in carpooling. Secondly, when the vehicles change the lanes aggressively, there is a substantial growth in the flow rate and capacity of the network. Polite lane change does not significantly affect the flow rate.

AB In recent years, field experiments have been performed on ring roadways with human-driven vehicles or with a mix of human-driven and autonomous vehicles. While these experiments demonstrate the potential for controlling traffic flows by a small number of autonomous vehicles, the theoretical framework about such a possibility is to a large extent incomplete. Indeed, most work on mixed traffic focused on classical asymptotical stability notions, neglecting that human drivers are prone to the interconnected instability known in the literature as string instability. This work aims to enhance the existing theories to meet the questions raised by the field experiments. It starts from the observation that the standard notion of string stability on a ring roadway is too demanding for a mixed traffic scenario: therefore, a new interconnected stability definition, named weak ring stability, is proposed. This new interconnected stability notion, in combination with classical stability, is able to explain phenomena observed in field experiments and to highlight possibilities and limitations of traffic control via sparse autonomous vehicle. Furthermore, it allows designing AV controllers with improved string stability specifications, at the price of reducing the sparsity of the autonomous vehicles.

AB A class of cooperative controllers is designed for a group of autonomous vehicles, using the relative positions between geographical neighbors and a specified target. The controller is equipped with three components: attractive component that drives each vehicle towards the target, repulsive component between adjacent vehicles, and rotation component for neighbored vehicles aligned with the target in a straight line. It is proved that the vehicles with the proposed autonomous controller can asymptotically fence a specified target to their convex hull. Meanwhile, the vehicles do not collide and they are not stuck in a singleton formation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To solve the problem of understeer and oversteer for autonomous vehicle under high-speed emergency obstacle avoidance conditions, considering the effect of steering angular frequency and vehicle speed on yaw rate for four-wheel steering vehicles in the frequency domain, a feed-forward controller for four-wheel steering autonomous vehicles that tracks the desired yaw rate is proposed. Furthermore, the steering sensitivity coefficient of the vehicle is compensated linearly with the change in the steering angular frequency and vehicle speed. In addition, to minimize the tracking errors caused by vehicle nonlinearity and external disturbances, an active disturbance rejection control feedback controller that tracks the desired lateral displacement and desired yaw angle is designed. Finally, CarSim (R) obstacle avoidance simulation results show that an autonomous vehicle with the four-wheel steering path tracking controller consisting of feed-forward control and feedback control could not only improve the tire lateral forces but also reduce tail flicking (oversteer) and pushing ahead (understeer) under high-speed emergency obstacle avoidance conditions.

AB One-way car-sharing systems are becoming increasingly popular, and the introduction of autonomous vehicles could make these systems even more widespread. Shared Autonomous Electric Vehicles could also allow for more controllable charging compared to private electric vehicles, allowing large scale demand response and providing essential ancillary services to the electric grid. In this work, we develop a simulation methodology for evaluating a Shared Autonomous Electric Vehicle system interacting with passengers and charging at designated charging stations using a heuristic-based charging strategy. The influence of fleet size is studied in terms of transport service quality and break-even prices for the system. We test the potential of the system to supply operating reserve by formulating an optimization problem for the optimal deployment of vehicles during a grid operator request. The results of the simulations for the case study of Tokyo show that a fleet of Shared Autonomous Electric Vehicles would only need to be about 10%-14% of a fleet of private cars providing a comparable level of transport service, with low break-even prices. Moreover, we show that the system can provide operating reserve under several operational conditions even at peak transport demand without significant disruption to transport service.

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

AB Autonomous driving is being discussed as a promising solution for transportation-related issues and might bring some improvement for users of the system. For instance, especially high mileage commuters might compensate for some of their time spent traveling as they will be able to undertake other activities while going to work. At the same time, there are still many uncertainties and little empirical data on the impact of autonomous driving on mode choices. This study addresses the impact of autonomous driving on value of travel time savings (VTTS) and mode choices for commuting trips using stated-choice experiments. Two use cases were addressed - a privately owned, and a shared autonomous vehicle - compared with other modes of transportation. The collected data were analyzed by performing a mixed logit model. The results show that mode-related factors such as time elements, especially in-vehicle time and cost, play a crucial role for mode choices that include autonomous vehicles. The study provides empirical evidence that autonomous driving may lead to a reduction in VTTS for commuting trips. It was found that driving autonomously in a privately owned vehicle might reduce the VTTS by 31% compared with driving manually, and is perceived similarly to in-vehicle time in public transportation. Furthermore, riding in a shared autonomous vehicle is perceived 10% less negatively than driving manually. The study provides important insights into VTTS by autonomous driving for commuting trips and could be a base for future research to build upon.

AB Autonomous vehicles are expected to significantly disrupt the mode choice behavior of travelers. This study uses household travel data collected in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) to explore the potential impact of private autonomous vehicles (PAV) on household vehicle ki-lometers travelled (VKT) and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Two distinct scenarios are formulated to quantify the implications of PAVs on potential changes in household vehicle ownership and public transit ridership. We observe a feasible reduction in the total number of vehicles owned by a household with ownership of a PAV but at the expense of an average additional 57% daily VKT. In addition, we observe that PAVs have the potential to replace household transit trips while on average more than doubling daily VKT and GHG emissions. These findings can help guide policies that penalize empty miles and encourage ride sharing.

AB In driving simulation, a scenario includes definitions of the road environment, the traffic situation, simulated vehicles' interactions with the participant's vehicle and measurements that need to be collected. The scenarios need to be designed in such a way that the research questions to be studied can be answered, which commonly imply exposing the participant for a couple of predefined specific situations that has to be both realistic and repeatable. This article presents an integrated algorithm based on Dynamic Actor Preparation and Automated Action Planning to control autonomous simulated vehicles in the simulation in order to generate predefined situations. This algorithm is thus able to plan driving actions for autonomous vehicles based on specific tasks with relevant contextual information as well as handling longitudinal transportation of simulated vehicles based on the contextual information in an automated manner. The conducted experiment shows that the algorithm is able to guarantee repeatability under autonomous traffic flow. The presented algorithm can benefit not only the driving simulation community, but also relevant areas, such as autonomous vehicle and in-vehicle device design by providing them with an algorithm for target pursue and driving task accomplishment, which can be used to design a human-vehicle cooperation system in the coming era of autonomous driving.

AB Transmissibility is a mathematical model that relates a subset of a system's outputs to another subset of outputs of the same system without knowledge of the external excitation or the dynamics of the system. This study investigates fault detection, localization, and mitigation of connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) platoons using transmissibility operators. A CAV platoon is a network of connected autonomous vehicles that communicate together to move in a specific path with the desired velocity. Failure in a physical component of a vehicle, or failure in the form of an internal delay, a cyber-attack, or a communication time-delay affects the safety and security of the CAV platoons. In this paper, we use measurements from sensors available in CAV platoons to identify transmissibility operators, which are used for health monitoring, fault localization, and fault mitigation in the platoon. We first consider the case of vehicle-to-cloud communication (V2C) to monitor the platoon's health. Then, we assume that the platoon loses communication with the cloud, and we monitor the health of the platoon based on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. We apply the proposed technique to a model of the platoon obtained using the bond graph approach, and an experimental setup consisting of three connected autonomous robots.

Autonomous EMSs aim achieving the potential benefits associated with energy exchanges between consumers and the grid, using bidirectional and power-controllable electric vehicle chargers. A suitable design for a controllable charger is presented, including the sizing of passive elements and controllers. This charger has been implemented using an experimental setup with a digital signal processor to validate its operation. The experimental results obtained foresee an adequate interaction between the proposed charger and a compatible autonomous EMS in a typical residential setting.

AB In this paper, we review technologies for autonomous ground vehicles and their present capabilities in research and in the automotive market. We outline technology requirements for enhanced functions and for infrastructure development. Since the recent Grand Challenge competition is a major force to advance technology in this field, we specifically refer to our experiences in developing a participating vehicle. We present a multisensor platform that has been proven in an off-road environment. It combines different sensing modalities that inherently yield uncertain information. Finite-state machines are formulated to generate rule-based autonomous behavior that enables fully autonomous off-road driving. Overall, the intent of the paper is to evaluate approaches and technologies used in the two Grand Challenges as they contribute to the needs of autonomous cars on the road.

The localization framework developed is sufficiently generic to be used on a variety of other autonomous ground vehicles and is demonstrated by its implementation using field data collected from two different trials on two different vehicles. The results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed localization framework in producing reliable and accurate position estimates for autonomous vehicles operating in a variety of unstructured domains.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL
AB Emergency scenarios may necessitate autonomous vehicle maneuvers up to their handling limits in order to avoid collisions. In these scenarios, vehicle stabilization becomes important to ensure that the vehicle does not lose control. However, stabilization actions may conflict with those necessary for collision avoidance, potentially leading to a collision. This paper presents a new control structure that integrates path tracking, vehicle stabilization, and collision avoidance and mediates among these sometimes conflicting objectives by prioritizing collision avoidance. It can even temporarily violate vehicle stabilization criteria if needed to avoid a collision. The framework is implemented using model predictive and feedback controllers. Incorporating tire nonlinearities into the model allows the controller to use all of the vehicle's performance capability to meet the objectives. A prediction horizon comprised of variable length time steps integrates the different time scales associated with stabilization and collision avoidance. Experimental data from an autonomous vehicle demonstrate the controller safely driving at the vehicle's handling limits and avoiding an obstacle suddenly introduced in the middle of a turn.

AB This article investigates weak thruster fault detection problem for autonomous underwater vehicle subject to the external disturbances. A weak thruster fault detection method is developed based on the combination of artificial immune system and single pre-processing. The number of measurable autonomous underwater vehicle's signals is limited and the weak thruster fault is easy to be compensated by the closed-loop control system. In this developed method, signal preprocessing is first used in the original autonomous underwater vehicle signals, including signal transformation, data fusion based on Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, and feature extraction based on isometric mapping algorithm, to reduce the external disturbance effect and prominently reflect thruster fault. Then artificial immune system is applied to conduct anomaly detection based on the processed autonomous underwater vehicle signals. In the process of fault detection, it includes two stages, training stage and testing stage. In training stage, the detectors are generated at first based on the autonomous underwater vehicle signals in healthy condition based on negative selection and positive selection. And then in testing stage, the generated detectors are used to detect whether fault occurs or not based on the principle of self and non-self discrimination. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the developed fault detection method, Beaver 2 autonomous underwater vehicle is used to conduct experiments. The comparative results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless sensors have collaborated with many real-time environments for the collection and processing of physical data. Mobile networks with sixth-generation (6G) technologies provide support for emerging applications using Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) and observe critical conditions. Although, autonomous vehicle-based routing solutions have presented significant development toward reliable and inter-vehicle communications. However, there are numerous research obstacles in terms of data delivery and transmission latency due to the unpredictable environment and changing states of IoT sensors. Therefore, this work presents an efficient and trusted autonomous vehicle routing protocol using 6G networks, which aims to guarantee high quality of service and data coverage. Firstly, the proposed protocol establishes a routing process using a simulated annealing optimization technique and improves energy optimization between IoT-based vehicles, and under difficult circumstances, it statistically guarantees the optimal solution. Secondly, it provides a risk-aware security system due to reliable session-oriented communication with network edges among connected vehicles and avoids uncertainties in the autonomous system. The proposed protocol is verified using simulations for varying vehicles and varying iterations that indicates a green communication system for the autonomous system with authenticity and system intelligence.

AB Connected Vehicles and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) provide various sources of vehicular related information to intersection infrastructure by integrating on-board sensors processing, wireless communication and other Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) technologies. Thus connected vehicle technologies can potentially remedy data collection limitations of existing urban intersection managements, enhancing the performances of intersection controls such as reducing vehicle delay, reducing vehicle number of stops and improving energy efficiency. This paper reviews optimization-based signal controls for different penetrations of connected vehicles and conventional vehicles environments, autonomous intersection management specific to completely 100% AVs road states, as well as signal-trajectory joint control for different adoptions of conventional vehicles, CVs and AVs mixture environments. Real time data processing, signal timing optimizations, vehicle trajectory motion planning and evaluation frameworks are summarized to highlight the advantages and limitations of respective intersection control paradigms. It is important to recognize that realistic scenarios in comparative assessments for proposed methods need to be achieved in future works. The effectiveness of different approaches is challenging to be compared without complete evaluation frameworks, and sensitivity analysis and hypothesis tests involving variety penetration rates and flow demands should be performed in order to test the stability of methods in different scenarios.

AB Autonomous vehicles' dynamics stability control is one key issue to ensure safety of self-driving. However, vehicle uncertainties and time-varying parameters could weaken the performance of autonomous vehicle stability control. Therefore, this article proposes a novel robust linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based H-infinite feedback algorithm for vehicle dynamics stability control, and this algorithm controls vehicle steering system and brake system via direct yaw moment control (DYC) and active front steering control (AFS). The presented controller is robust against vehicle parametric uncertainties, including the vehicle mass and vehicle longitudinal velocity. A linear parameter varying lateral model is constructed utilizing polytopic uncertainty method considering time-varying vehicle longitudinal velocity and mass, where a polytope that contains finite vertices is established to contain all of the possible selections for uncertainty parameters. Then, the H-infinite feedback controller integrating DYC and AFS is derived via LMI technique. Finally, experimental results based on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform illustrate that the presented controller has better performance of ensuring autonomous vehicle dynamics stability than other controllers.

AB This paper addresses the issue of autonomous competitive yet safe driving in the context of the Indy Autonomous Challenge (IAC) simulation race. The IAC is the first multi-vehicle autonomous head-to-head competition, reaching speeds of 300 km/h along an oval track modeled after the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS). We present a racing controller that attempts to maximize progress along the track while avoiding collisions with opponent vehicles and obeying the race rules. To this end, the racing controller first computes a race line offline. During the race, it repeatedly computes a small set of dynamically feasible maneuver candidates, each tested for collision with the opponent vehicles. It then selects a collision-free maneuver that maximizes the progress along the track and obeys the race rules. Our controller was tested in a 6-vehicle simulation, managing to run competitively with no collision over 30 laps. In addition, it managed to drive within a close range of the leading vehicle during most of the IAC final simulation race.

AB In this paper, event-triggered model predictive control (EMPC) with adaptive artificial potential field (APF) is designed to realize obstacle avoidance and trajectory tracking for autonomous electric vehicles. An adaptive APF cost function is added to achieve obstacle avoidance and guarantee stability. The optimization problem for MPC is feasible by considering a special obstacle avoidance constraint. An event-triggered mechanism is proposed to reduce computational burden and ensure effectiveness of obstacle avoidance. Input and state constraints of autonomous electric vehicles are considered in both feasibility and stability by a robust terminal set. Effectiveness of both obstacle avoidance and trajectory tracking is shown by experimental results on autonomous electric vehicles.(c) 2022 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) work in a complex marine environment. Its system reliability and autonomous fault diagnosis are particularly important and can provide the basis for underwater vehicles to take corresponding security policy in a failure. Aiming at the characteristics of the underwater vehicle which has uncertain system and modeling difficulty, an improved Elman neural network is introduced which is applied to the underwater vehicle motion modeling. Through designing self-feedback connection with fixed gain in the unit connection as well as increasing the feedback of the output layer node, improved Elman network has faster convergence speed and generalization ability. This method for high-order nonlinear system has stronger identification ability. Firstly, the residual is calculated by comparing the output of the underwater vehicle model (estimation in the motion state) with the actual measured values. Secondly, characteristics of the residual are analyzed on the basis of fault judging criteria. Finally, actuator fault diagnosis of the autonomous underwater vehicle is carried out. The results of the simulation experiment show that the method is effective.

AB To improve the observation capability of the ocean, the combination of the static cabled ocean observatory network and the dynamic autonomous underwater vehicle has attracted more and more attention. In this paper, a non-contact docking system for the autonomous underwater vehicle is developed to combine the advantages of the cabled ocean observatory network and the autonomous underwater vehicle. The system includes both acoustic and optical navigation, underwater wireless communication, non-contact power transfer, and monitoring and controlling of the docking system. This docking system was verified by sea trials at depths of 50 and 105 m. The autonomous underwater vehicle successfully docked 11 times, during which non-contact power transfer and wireless communication were completed. The charging power reached 682 W, with a total efficiency of 78.5%, and the efficiency of the power transfer unit was 92%. The rate of wireless data transfer reached 3.1 MB/s. For the first time, this docking system has realized complete homing and docking navigation, wireless communication and charging in a water depth of more than 100 m, thus establishing a good foundation for the combination of the cabled ocean observatory network and autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB Recent years have witnessed exciting developments in our transportation system with increasingly intelligent vehicles and infrastructure. The transportation system is envisioned to be highly heterogeneous, consisting of diverse participants with mixed intelligence and connectivity. Among them, autonomous vehicles have the highest intelligence and connectivity level and could contribute greatly to the operation of the transportation system in an efficient and reliable manner. However, the current design of autonomous driving techniques is mostly concerned with the autonomous vehicle at the individual level, and the overall transportation system does not provide proactive support to autonomous driving. In fact, the increasing intelligence and connectivity in transportation could be leveraged to significantly enhance the safety and efficiency of individual vehicles and the entire system. To facilitate this, vehicles need to interact and cooperate both among themselves and with the transportation infrastructure and management. In this article, we propose the societal intelligence (SI) framework. Different from the existing multientity intelligence frameworks, SI allows for much diverse interactions among the multiple entities at different levels and is thus suitable for transportation. In addition, we also render the driving process into four functional layers and demonstrate how the social intelligence framework can adapt to these layers, respectively.

AB Autonomous driving services depends on active sensing from modules such as camera, LiDAR, radar, and communication units. Traditionally, these modules process the sensed data on high-performance computing units inside the vehicle, which can deploy intelligent algorithms and AI models. The sensors mentioned above can produce large volumes of data, potentially reaching up to 20 Terabytes. This data size is influenced by factors such as the duration of driving, the data rate, and the sensor specifications. Consequently, this substantial amount of data can lead to significant power consumption on the vehicle. Similarly, a substantial amount of data will be exchanged between infrastructure sensors and vehicles for collaborative vehicle applications or fully connected autonomous vehicles. This communication process generates an additional surge of energy consumption. Although the autonomous vehicle domain has seen advancements in sensory technologies, wireless communication, computing and AI/ML algorithms, the challenge still exists in how to apply and integrate these technology innovations to achieve energy efficiency. This survey reviews and compares the connected vehicular applications, vehicular communications, approximation and Edge AI techniques. The focus is on energy efficiency by covering newly proposed approximation and enabling frameworks. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first to review the latest approximate Edge AI frameworks and publicly available datasets in energy-efficient autonomous driving. The insights from this survey can benefit the collaborative driving service development on low-power and memory-constrained systems and the energy optimization of autonomous vehicles.

AB Autonomous driving strategies for intersection scenarios are challenging due to the varying traffic conditions of oncoming vehicles. Based on the connected vehicle technology, this article proposes an autonomous T-intersection driving strategy considering the oncoming vehicles for motion-planning and path following. A finite-state machine (FSM) is developed in the motion planner to decide the driving strategies considering the oncoming vehicles. Information pieces from the connected vehicle, specifically vehicle position and speed, are selected and effectively utilized to construct the temporal windows that manage the driving states transition of the FSM. Speed profiles in different driving states are modified for collision avoidance. Then, a path-following controller based on the back-stepping method is designed to track the planned path and speed simultaneously. The proposed strategy is validated by both simulation and experimental investigations. The results show the controlled vehicle can safely and quickly pass through the intersection using the proposed driving strategy that avoids possible collisions with the oncoming vehicles.

AB Since autonomous four-wheel independently drive electric vehicles have the characteristics of parameter uncertainties, non-linearities and redundant actuators, trajectory tracking control for lane change of autonomous electric vehicles is regarded as a challenging task. A novel non-linear trajectory tracking control strategy is designed for lane changing manoeuvre. First, a dynamic trajectory planning strategy is proposed to update the desired trajectory according to the real-time information acquired through vehicle-to-vehicle communications. Second, a robust adaptive non-linear fuzzy backstepping controller is presented to produce the generalised forces/moment of autonomous electric vehicles, and the stability of this proposed adaptive controller is proven by the Lyapunov theory. Then, the quadratic optimisation goal function of tire energy dissipated power is constructed, and the optimal control allocation method is proposed to produce the desired longitudinal and lateral tire forces of autonomous electric vehicles. Finally, simulation results manifest that the proposed adaptive control strategy has the distinguished tracking performance.

Moreover, the existing literature lacks discussions on integrating next-generation wireless communication technologies into connected vehicular networks. Hence, this paper introduces a tailored bandwidth management algorithm for streaming applications of autonomous vehicle passengers. It leverages cutting-edge 6G wireless technology to create a network with high-speed transmission and broad coverage, ensuring smooth streaming application performance. The key features of bandwidth allocation for diverse streaming applications in this work include bandwidth relay and pre-loading of video clips assisted by vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Through simulations, this research effectively showcases the algorithm's ability to fulfill the bandwidth needs of diverse streaming applications for autonomous vehicle passengers. Specifically, during periods of peak user bandwidth demand, it notably increases the bandwidth accessible for streaming applications. On average, users experience a substantial 55% improvement in the bandwidth they can access. This validation affirms the viability and promise of the proposed approach in efficiently managing the intricate complexities of bandwidth allocation issues for streaming services within the connected autonomous vehicular networks.

AB With the deployment of autonomous vehicles (AV), it can be assumed that a heterogeneous flow consisting of human driving and autonomous vehicles will appear in urban road networks. Numerous studies have shown that bus stops tend to have great influence on the nearby traffic flow, but few insightful researches have been conducted on the influence of bus bays in the context of heterogeneous traffic flow consisting of human driving vehicles and autonomous vehicles. In this paper, a new KKSW (Kerner-Klenov-Schreckeneberg-Wolf)-BB (bus bay)-AVHDV (autonomous vehicles and human driving vehicles) CA (cellular automata) model is proposed to study the influence of bus bays on heterogeneous traffic flow based on the well-known KKSW CA model. Through numerical simulations, the flow characteristics, congestion patterns and speed characteristics in the heterogeneous traffic flow are studied. The frequency and severity of rear-end collisions are analyzed to study the influence of the bus bay on traffic safety. The results show that bus bays may have a significant impact on traffic flow efficiency and traffic safety. The introduction of AVs in the heterogeneous traffic flow could significantly improve traffic efficiency and safety near the bus bay, especially under the condition of heavy traffic flow.

AB This paper presents the vision of the Artificial Vision and Intelligent Systems Laboratory (VisLab) on future automated vehicles, ranging from sensor selection up to their extensive testing. VisLab's design choices are explained using the BRAiVE autonomous vehicle prototype as an example. BRAiVE, which is specifically designed to develop, test, and demonstrate advanced safety applications with different automation levels, features a high integration level and a low-cost sensor suite, which are mainly based on vision, as opposed to many other autonomous vehicle implementations based on expensive and invasive sensors. The importance of performing extensive tests to validate the design choices is considered to be a hard requirement, and different tests have been organized, including an intercontinental trip from Italy to China. This paper also presents the test, the main challenges, and the vehicles that have been specifically developed for this test, which was performed by four autonomous vehicles based on BRAiVE's architecture. This paper also includes final remarks on VisLab's perspective on future vehicles' sensor suite.

AB Situational awareness is crucial for autonomous driving in urban environments. This paper describes the moving vehicle detection and tracking module that we developed for our autonomous driving robot Junior. The robot won second place in the Urban Grand Challenge, an autonomous driving race organized by the U.S. Government in 2007. The module provides reliable detection and tracking of moving vehicles from a high-speed moving platform using laser range finders. Our approach models both dynamic and geometric properties of the tracked vehicles and estimates them using a single Bayes filter per vehicle. We present the notion of motion evidence, which allows us to overcome the low signal-to-noise ratio that arises during rapid detection of moving vehicles in noisy urban environments. Furthermore, we show how to build consistent and efficient 2D representations out of 3D range data and how to detect poorly visible black vehicles. Experimental validation includes the most challenging conditions presented at the Urban Grand Challenge as well as other urban settings.

AB In this paper, experimental study of dynamic based trajectory tracking of an autonomous ground vehicle is presented.
   The vehicle with two front (steering) and two rear (driving) wheels and also an on-board computer, two DC motors, two batteries and two measurement systems is a good example of an autonomous ground vehicle. The dynamic model of this vehicle is presented in the state-space form with steering and driving torques as inputs; kinematic and dynamic parameters of the model and also electrical parameters of the motors are identified, measurement systems are calibrated and the simulation of controlling this model by feedback linearization method is compared with the experiments.
   The results of simulations and experiments for the feedback linearization technique are compared with those of a simple PID controller and also the results for sharp turn trajectory tracking illustrate the validity of the method used and the usefulness of the built autonomous ground vehicle.

AB Amidst rising interest in autonomous vehicle services, extant literature reveals a paucity of research examining: 1) both cognitive and emotional evaluations; 2) characteristics of the service context (e.g. risk) and artificial intelligence (e.g. autonomy); and 3) heterogenous outcomes. Moreover, there are mixed findings on autonomous vehicle adoption/resistance. To address these gaps, we develop the Customer Responses to Unmanned Intelligent -transport Services based on Emotions and Cognitions (CRUISE-C) framework by extending the earlier CRUISE framework and building on the Elaboration Likelihood Model. The framework further delineates four segments, which differ in cognitive and emotional evaluations of fully autonomous vehicle services. We test CRUISE-C using three experimental studies. Study 1 shows that the resistant segments consider fully autonomous (vs. regular) vehicle services to be more vulnerable, and less reliable and convenient. Study 2 shows that a service failure involving fully autonomous (vs. regular) vehicles does not increase negative emotions in any segment, but attenuates perceived severity in Segment 1 ("Avoiders") and slightly amplifies perceived severity in Segment 4 ("Aficionados"). In Study 3, a machine learning model reveals segment membership as the strongest predictor of individuals' readiness to adopt autonomous vehicles, followed by reliance on taxis, female vs. male, and cognitive and emotional evaluations.

AB Semi-autonomous cars are already on the road and highly autonomous cars will soon be with us. Little is understood about how drivers will adapt to the changing relationship with their vehicle, but to ensure safety and consumer acceptance, this insight is vital. To this end, an on-road study in a semi-autonomous vehicle was undertaken with six UK drivers. The 'think aloud' technique was employed and video and audio footage of their interaction with the vehicle was captured. Neisser's (1976) Perceptual Cycle Model (PCM) was used to analyse the data and three case studies are presented to highlight how poor synergy between driver and semi-autonomous vehicles can occur from the lens of Schema, Action or World information. Seven key design considerations are proposed to ensure a more positive and safer interaction between driver and autonomous vehicle to guide focus by manufacturers. Further evidence for the existence of a 'counter cycle' (Plant and Stanton, 2015) within the PCM is found and how this relates to the challenges of using verbal protocals expressed during a fast moving dynamic task is discussed.

AB Autonomous vehicles are limited in their perception capabilities to the field of view of their onboard sensors. Additionally, the environment may not be completely perceivable due to the presence of occlusions and blind spots. To overcome this challenge, wireless vehicle-to-vehicle communication could be employed to send and receive sensory information about the surroundings among vehicles within the vicinity. This form of cooperative perception (CP) turns every vehicle into a moving sensor platform, extending each vehicle's field of view and line of sight. This study proposes one such technique for CP over a short range. The system uses visual and inertial sensors, augmented by a positioning system, to perform cooperative relative localisation between two vehicles that share a common field of view. This allows one vehicle to locate the other vehicle in its frame of reference. Subsequently, information about objects in the field of view of one vehicle, localised using a monocular camera is relayed to the other vehicle through communication. A mobile multi-robot testbed was developed to emulate autonomous vehicles and to experimentally evaluate the proposed method through a series of driving scenario test cases, in which CP could be effective and crucial to the safety and comfort of driving.

AB In this paper, a novel system architecture including a massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) or a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and multiple autonomous vehicles is considered in vehicle location systems. The location parameters of autonomous vehicles can be estimated based on the deep unfolding technique, which is a recent advance of deep learning. Traditional vehicle location methods such as the global position system (GPS) can only locate the target vehicles with relatively low accuracy. The super resolution cannot be achieved when two vehicles are too close, which means that the safety incidents exist when autonomous vehicles are deployed in future intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Different from the existing massive MIMO or RIS equipped with a regular array such as uniform rectangular array (URA) and uniform circular array (UCA), we exploit a massive MIMO or a RIS equipped with a conformal array extended from traditional regular array. First, the rotation from the global coordinate system to the local coordinate system is achieved based on geometric algebra. Second, 2D-DOA estimation of autonomous vehicles is modeled as a novel block sparse recovery problem. Third, the deep network architecture SBLNet is implemented to learn the nonlinear characteristic from the DOAs of autonomous vehicles and the data received by massive MIMOs or RISs. The 2D-DOA and polarization parameters can be estimated based on SBLNet with relatively low computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that SBLNet performs better than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of estimation accuracy and successful probability. The SBLNet is also suitable for the practical scenario considering fast moving autonomous vehicles, while, the traditional block sparse recovery methods fail in this complex scenario.

SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING

DT Article
AB In consideration of the difficulty in determining the parameters of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles in multi-degree-of-freedom motion control, a hybrid method that combines particle swarm optimization (PSO) with artificial fish school algorithm (AFSA) is proposed in this paper. The optimization process of the PSO-AFSA method is firstly introduced. With the control simulation models in the horizontal plane and vertical plane, the PSO-AFSA method is elaborated when applied in control parameter optimization for an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle. Both simulation tests and field trials were carried out to prove the efficiency of the PSO-AFSA method in underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle control parameter optimization. The optimized control parameters showed admirable control quality by enabling the underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle to reach the desired states with fast convergence.

AB Real-time route tracking is an important research topic for autonomous vehicles used in industrial facilities. Traditional methods such as copper line tracking on the ground, wireless guidance systems, and laser systems are still used in route tracking. In this study, a deep-learning-based floor path model for route tracking of autonomous vehicles is proposed. A deep-learning floor path model and algorithm have been developed for highly accurate route tracking, which avoids collisions of vehicles and follows the shortest route to reach the destination. The floor path model consists of markers. Routes in the floor path model are created by using these markers. The floor path model is transmitted to autonomous vehicles as a vector by a central server. The server dispatches the target marker address to the vehicle to move. The vehicle calculates all possible routes to this address and chooses the shortest one. Marker images on the selected route are processed using image processing and classified with a pre-trained deep-CNN model. If the classified image and the image on the selected route are the same, the vehicle proceeds toward its destination. While the vehicle moves on the route, it sends the last classified marker to the server. Other autonomous vehicles use this marker to determine the location of this vehicle. Other vehicles on the route wait to avoid a collision. As a result of the experimental studies we have carried out, the route tracking of the vehicles has been successfully achieved.

ID DIGITAL TWIN
AB As autonomous vehicle development continues at growing speeds, so does the need to optimize, diagnose, and test various elements of autonomous systems under different conditions. Since such processes should be carried out in parallel, it may result in bottlenecks in development and increased complexity. The trend for Digital Twins offers a promising option for the diagnosis and testing to be carried out separately from the physical devices, incl. autonomous vehicles in the virtual world. The idea of intercommunication between virtual and physical twins provides possibilities to estimate risks, drawbacks, physical damages to the vehicle's drive systems, and the physical vehicle's critical conditions. Although providing communications between these systems arises at the speed that will be adequate to represent the physical vehicle in the virtual world correctly, it is still a trendy topic. This paper aims to demonstrate the enhancement of communications by using the Robot Operating System (ROS) as a middleware interface between two twinning systems by the example of the autonomous vehicle's propulsion drive. Data gathered from the physical and virtual worlds can be exchanged in the middle to allow for continuous training and optimization of the propulsion drive model, which would lead to more efficient path planning and energy-efficient drive of the autonomous vehicle itself. Additionally, a comparative analysis of ROS and its next version ROS2 is provided, discussing their differences and outlining drawbacks.

AB The risk of motion sickness is considerably higher in autonomous vehicles than it is in human-operated vehicles. Their introduction will therefore require systems that mitigate motion sickness. We investigated whether this can be achieved by augmenting the vehicle interior with additional visualizations. Participants were immersed in motion simulations on a moving-base driving simulator, where they were backward-facing passengers of an autonomous vehicle. Using a Head-Mounted Display, they were presented either with a regular view from inside the vehicle, or with augmented views that offered additional cues on the vehicle's present motion or motion 500ms into the future, displayed on the vehicle's interior panels. In contrast to the hypotheses and other recent studies, no difference was found between conditions. The absence of differences between conditions suggests a ceiling effect providing a regular view may limit motion sickness, but presentation of additional visual information beyond this does not further reduce sickness.

AB Occlusion is a critical problem in the Autonomous Driving System. Solving this problem requires robust collaboration among autonomous vehicles traveling on the same roads. However, transferring the entirety of raw sensors' data among autonomous vehicles is expensive and can cause a delay in communication. This paper proposes a method called Realtime Collaborative Vehicular Communication based on Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) map. The BEV map holds the accurate depth information from the point cloud image while its 2D representation enables the method to use a novel and well-trained image-based backbone network. Most importantly, we encode the object detection results into the BEV representation to reduce the volume of data transmission and make real-time collaboration between autonomous vehicles possible. The output of this process, the BEV map, can also be used as direct input to most route planning modules. Numerical results show that this novel method can increase the accuracy of object detection by cross-verifying the results from multiple points of view. Thus, in the process, this new method also reduces the object detection challenges that stem from occlusion and partial occlusion. Additionally, different from many existing methods, this new method significantly reduces the data needed for transfer between vehicles, achieving a speed of 21.92 Hz for both the object detection process and the data transmission process, which is sufficiently fast for a real-time system.

For data analysis and improvement methods, scenarios for FOT were classified and defined by considering autonomous driving level (SAE J3016) and the viewpoints of the vehicle, driver, road, environment, etc. To obtain data from FOT, performance indicators were selected, a data collection environment was implemented in the test cases, and driving roads were selected to obtain driving data from the vehicle while it was driven on an actual road. In the pilot FOT course, data were collected in various driving situations using a test vehicle, and the effect of autonomous driving-related functions on improving driving safety was studied through data analysis of discovered major events.

AB Efficient intersection planning is one of the most challenging tasks for an autonomous vehicle at present. Politeness to other traffic participants and reaction to surrounding information are the key aspects that determine the performance of planning algorithm for an autonomous vehicle. In order to capture these aspects, we propose a planning framework, based on the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), to ensure social compliance and optimize the motion response of autonomous vehicles. The framework designs a novel POMDP model to ensure effective prediction of behavioral intentions and decision-making at intersections with no traffic signs and low traffic volume. Then, a deterministic planner is employed as the baseline to realize planning. Specifically, we consider both the driving position and the facing angle of the vehicle in real-world situations. At the same time, we utilize scattering methods for probability updating and intent determination to improve the algorithm's adaptability to real-world scenarios. The proposed framework is evaluated in different scenarios to demonstrate its capabilities in terms of the interactive planning for an autonomous vehicle.

AB As suburbanization and unprecedented population aging are converging, enhanced personal mobility for suburban residents is required. In this study, a collaborative scheme involving park-and-ride services associated with public transport and a shared autonomous vehicle system are proposed. Two residential areas in the Nagoya metropolitan region, Japan, are considered: a residential area at the outer edge of a subway line and a commuter town with a nearby railway station. Three user groups are assumed: park-and-ride commuters who park shared autonomous vehicles at the station and take the train to their workplaces; inbound commuters who disembark from trains at the station and use the vehicles to reach their workplaces within the target area; and elderly and disabled residents, who use shared autonomous vehicles for trips within the target area. The system performance is investigated through agent-based simulation. The results suggest that, in the edge case, approximately 400 shared autonomous vehicles can facilitate more than 10,000 trips at an appropriate level of service. For the commuter town, fewer than 400 vehicles can provide rapid responses with a wait time of approximately 5 min for more than 5000 trips per day. Thus, the proposed system can feasibly provide a quick response service.

TI Futuramas of the present: the "driver problem" in the autonomous vehicle
   sociotechnical imaginary
SO HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB The visions surrounding "self-driving" or "autonomous" vehicles are an exemplary instance of a sociotechnical imaginary: visions of a future technology that has yet to be developed or is in the process of development. One of the central justifications for the development of autonomous vehicles is the claim that they will reduce automobility related death and injury. Central to this narrative is the assumption that more than 90% of road crashes are the result of "driver error." This paper describes the process by which this statistic has been constructed within road safety research and subsequently accepted as a received fact. It is one of the principal semiotic components of the autonomous vehicle sociotechnical imaginary: if human drivers are responsible for similar to 90% of road crashes, autonomous vehicles should in principle be able to reduce road death and injury rates by a similar percentage. In this paper, it is argued that death and injury are not an aggregate of events that can be distributed across the three central variables of traditional road safety research: the driver, the vehicle, and the environment. The autonomous vehicle sociotechnical imaginary has embraced the central assumption of road safety research, that road violence is not an intrinsic property of automobility but is contingent because largely due to driver error. On the basis of this assumption it has been possible to configure autonomous vehicles as the solution to road violence. Although sociotechnical imaginaries are typically oriented towards the future, it is the significance of the autonomous vehicle sociotechnical imaginary in the present that is the focus of this paper. Autonomous vehicles are not the radically transformational technology their proponents claim but simply the most recent of a succession of automobility sociotechnical imaginaries. They are not transformational because their promotion ensures the continued reproduction of more of the same: namely, more automobility.

AB Non-rail autonomous public transport vehicles have emerged over the last few years. Technical progress in automation has resulted in a growing number of autonomous shuttle pilot experiments. Although these systems are technologically feasible, determining the extent to which they correspond to users' needs and expectations remains a major issue. In order to answer that question, we conducted a systematic review which synthesizes the literature regarding the acceptability and willingness to use this type of autonomous public transport. This literature review allowed us to identify 39 documents addressing 70 factors of acceptability, acceptance and usage of non-rail autonomous public transport vehicles. The most cited factors in the literature concern service characteristics (times, schedules, fares) and safety issues (road-safety, on-board security). Factors related to automation level, comfort and access to the vehicle feature appear to a lesser extent. Acceptance is also related to personal factors, such as socio-demographics, travel habits, and personality. This review could be of interest to designers and manufacturers of non-rail autonomous public transport vehicles, as well as policy makers, and assist with the successful implementation of autonomous public transport services which are better adapted and meet the needs of all potential users.

TI Analysis of the Relationship between Vehicle Behaviors of Changing Lane
   and Volume of Traffic under Different Operating Ratios of Autonomous
   Vehicles
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL
AB The lane-changing behavior is one of the important causes in traffic accident in congest traffic, and many behaviors of change lane affect volume of traffic. When autonomous driving vehicles are running on road with human-driven vehicles, the effects of change lane on traffic are different. In all human-driven vehicles traffic, the vehicle behaviors of changing lane are more competent. When autonomous driving vehicles are running in mixed traffic, the behaviors of changing lane decrease and the volume of traffic increases. However, a few studies have involved the relationship between traffic volume and lane-change behavior. In a sense, the study of this relationship is good for understanding the operation mechanism of mixed traffic. In this paper, we proposed the linear regression model to describe the relationship between traffic volume and lane-change behavior. The model can be used to establish the basic graph model. Here, we used empirical, simulation, and data-driven methods to obtain data and established a multiple linear regression model. First, we empirically study the continuous traffic with all human-driven vehicles. Then, the corresponding simulation model is established, and the availability of the simulation model is proved by data comparison with empirical study. Finally, 9 rounds of simulation experiments are carried out with the established simulation model. The number of autonomous driving vehicles in each round of simulation experiment increases by 10%. Then, we analyze the data of the behaviors of changing lane and the volume of traffic from simulation experiments. The following was found: (1) an increase in autonomous driving vehicle leads to an increase in traffic volume and a slight decrease in lane changing behaviors; (2) the influence of different proportions of autonomous vehicles on the traffic volume of lanes at different locations is slightly different; and (3) the relationships among the rate of vehicles entering lane, the rate of vehicles exiting lane together, and the volume of traffic show obvious linear relationships with the increase in autonomous driving vehicles. We used multiple linear regression models to carry out description, and the obtained parameter value intervals are close under different operating ratios of autonomous vehicles. To sum up, on multilane roads, especially 4-lane urban expressways, autonomous driving vehicles join in the traffic, which can effectively increase the volume of traffic of each lane while reducing vehicle behaviors of changing lane. The relationships between vehicle behaviors of changing lane and the traffic volume in mixed traffic show linear relationships with the increase in autonomous driving vehicles. In the future, we will further study whether this relationship model can be used in discrete traffic flow.

AB For decades, motorsport has been an incubator for innovations in the automotive sector and brought forth systems, like, disk brakes or rearview mirrors. Autonomous racing series such as Roborace, F1Tenth, or the Indy Autonomous Challenge (IAC) are envisioned as playing a similar role within the autonomous vehicle sector, serving as a proving ground for new technology at the limits of the autonomous systems capabilities. This paper outlines the software stack and approach of the TUM Autonomous Motorsport team for their participation in the IAC, which holds two competitions: A single-vehicle competition on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and a passing competition at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Nine university teams used an identical vehicle platform: A modified Indy Lights chassis equipped with sensors, a computing platform, and actuators. All the teams developed different algorithms for object detection, localization, planning, prediction, and control of the race cars. The team from Technical University of Munich (TUM) placed first in Indianapolis and secured second place in Las Vegas. During the final of the passing competition, the TUM team reached speeds and accelerations close to the limit of the vehicle, peaking at around 270km h-1 $270\,\text{km\hspace{0.05em}h}{}<^>{-1}$ and 28ms-2 $28\,ms{}<^>{-2}$. This paper will present details of the vehicle hardware platform, the developed algorithms, and the workflow to test and enhance the software applied during the 2-year project. We derive deep insights into the autonomous vehicle's behavior at high speed and high acceleration by providing a detailed competition analysis. On the basis of this, we deduce a list of lessons learned and provide insights on promising areas of future work based on the real-world evaluation of the displayed concepts.

AB In this study, a method is devised that allows the intentions of autonomous vehicles to be effectively communicated to pedestrians and passengers via an efficient interactive interface. Visual and auditory factors are used as variables to investigate the effects of different autonomous vehicle signal factors on the judgment of pedestrians and to determine the main factors such that the best combination can be proposed. Two visual dimensions (i.e., color and flashing) and three auditory dimensions (i.e., rhythm, frequency, and melody) are used as the experimental signal variables. In addition, deceleration and waiting-to-restart scenarios are investigated. Multiple-choice questions and a subjective cognition scale are used for evaluation. The results show that the combination of green and slow rhythm can be used for the road-user-first case, whereas the combination of red and fast rhythm can be used for the vehicle-first case. Under the same intention, factors of color, flashing, rhythm, and melody are highly similar in terms of the combination mode, except for the frequency. In the deceleration and waiting-to-restart scenarios, the frequencies of the best signal are high and low frequencies, respectively. The results of this study can be used as a reference for the signal design of autonomous vehicles in the future and provide ideas for the interactions between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles, especially quadcopters, play key roles in many real-world applications and the related quadcopter autonomous control algorithms have attracted a great deal of attention. In this paper, we address the vision-based autonomous landing problem of a quadcopter on a ground moving target. Firstly, we propose a disturbance observer-based control algorithm, consisting of a nonlinear disturbance observer and robust altitude and attitude controllers. This algorithm is based on the quadcopter dynamics model, and its stability is strictly proved using Lyapunov's theory. Secondly, we develop an autonomous landing planner which we test for various landing scenarios to deliver improved reliability and accuracy of the landing mission. These theoretical studies are complemented by a numerical feasibility study, before demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach under actual flight conditions with an experimental quadcopter platform.

AB In the process of autonomous vehicle motion planning and to create comfort for vehicle occupants, factors that must be considered are the vehicle's safety features and the road's slipperiness and smoothness. In this paper, we build a mathematical model based on the combination of a genetic algorithm and a neural network to offer lane-change solutions of autonomous vehicles, focusing on human vehicle control skills. Traditional moving planning methods often use vehicle kinematic and dynamic constraints when creating lane-change trajectories for autonomous vehicles. When comparing this generated trajectory with a man-generated moving trajectory, however, there is in fact a significant difference. Therefore, to draw the optimal factors from the actual driver's lane-change operations, the solution in this paper builds the training data set for the moving planning process with lane change operation by humans with optimal elements. The simulation results are performed in a MATLAB simulation environment to demonstrate that the proposed solution operates effectively with optimal points such as operator maneuvers and improved comfort for passengers as well as creating a smooth and slippery lane-change trajectory.

AB For an autonomous vehicle to operate safely and effectively, an accurate and robust localization system is essential. While there are a variety of vehicle localization techniques in literature, there is a lack of effort in comparing these techniques and identifying their potentials and limitations for autonomous vehicle applications. Hence, this paper evaluates the state-of-the-art vehicle localization techniques and investigates their applicability on autonomous vehicles. The analysis starts with discussing the techniques which merely use the information obtained from on-board vehicle sensors. It is shown that although some techniques can achieve the accuracy required for autonomous driving but suffer from the high cost of the sensors and also sensor performance limitations in different driving scenarios (e.g., cornering and intersections) and different environmental conditions (e.g., darkness and snow). This paper continues the analysis with considering the techniques which benefit from off-board information obtained from V2X communication channels, in addition to vehicle sensory information. The analysis shows that augmenting off-board information to sensory information has potential to design low-cost localization systems with high accuracy and robustness, however, their performance depends on penetration rate of nearby connected vehicles or infrastructure and the quality of network service.

AB This paper addresses the achievement of floating autonomous manipulation of the underwater biomimetic vehicle-manipulator system (UBVMS). A practical vehicle-manipulator coordinated plan and control methodology of the UBVMS for autonomous interventions are designed. First, the system configuration is introduced, and the optimal work space is confirmed. Then, the control framework of the UBVMS mainly consisting of online motion planning, multitask kinematic control, dynamic feedforward compensation, and adaptive parameter undulatory control for autonomous manipulation is presented. The online motion planning method with resort to tracking differentiator is developed to produce desired task trajectory and reference rate. The singularity-robust multitask kinematic control algorithm with state observers is designed to obtain system reference velocity. The couple influence on the vehicle induced by the presence of the manipulator is described as the dynamic feedforward compensation signal to reduce undesired waggle of the UBVMS. Adaptive parameter modifier of the biomimetic propulsor is designed to satisfy multifarious performance requirements in different motion phases. Finally, pool experiments in multiple scenarios for autonomous grasping manipulation are conducted to verify the effectiveness and adaptability of the developed coordinated plan and control strategy.

AB For a foreseeable future, autonomous vehicles (AVs) will operate in traffic together with human-driven vehicles. Their planning and control systems need extensive testing, including early-stage testing in simulations where the interactions among autonomous/human-driven vehicles are represented. Motivated by the need for such simulation tools, we propose a game-theoretic approach to modeling vehicle interactions, in particular, for urban traffic environments with unsignalized intersections. We develop traffic models with heterogeneous (in terms of their driving styles) and interactive vehicles based on our proposed approach, and use them for virtual testing, evaluation, and calibration of AV control systems. For illustration, we consider two AV control approaches, analyze their characteristics and performance based on the simulation results with our developed traffic models, and optimize the parameters of one of them.

AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology has brought a shift in the traditional role of the driver. This paper applies a user-centred design approach to designing a new AV interior to better support drivers. Three empirical studies were conducted, involving a total of 92 drivers (with 44 in Study 1, 12 in Study 2, and 36 in Study 3) to explore user needs and requirements in an AV. In Study 1, safety and comfort, together with a variety of non-driving activities, were identified as the principal concerns about future autonomous vehicles. Based on these findings, Study 2 proposes a new rotatable seating position for AVs, with an in-vehicle information display to facilitate users' activities and situational awareness while driving. Study 3 consists of a series of laboratory simulator evaluation studies, and this indicated that drivers in the proposed design condition had better situational awareness in an AV when dealing with take-over situations. Such findings suggest the possibility of applying rear-facing seats in autonomous vehicles to support in-vehicle non-driving activities. Some specific implications of designs to enhance a driver's situational awareness have also been suggested.

DE Integrity; autonomous vehicles; alert limit; navigation
AB Integrity is one critical performance indicator for navigation in safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles. Alert limit is one of the representative parameters in integrity monitoring which defines the maximum tolerable positioning error for an operation to safely proceed. But the integrity requirements for global navigation satellite system (GNSS) assessment are quite different from those for other applications. For autonomous vehicles, a reasonable alert limit needs to ensure the vehicle security and take full advantage of the space between vehicle and lane as much as possible. Based on the analysis of integrity application differences from civil aviation to autonomous vehicles, an improved alert limit determination method is proposed in this paper. The kinematic model is firstly introduced into the online determination of alert limit. The integrity risk on two sides are allocated optimally respect to the road geometry and kinematic model. The fixed cuboid bounding box is replaced by a subversive fan-shaped bounding box which is more reasonable to cover the safety-critical areas. The discussion compared with the Ford model also verified the superiority of the proposed method. Finally the paper also gives the alert limits calculated based on the Chinese standards and hopefully it could provide some references for the navigation integrity assessment for autonomous vehicles.

AB The introduction of shared autonomous vehicles into the transport system is suggested to bring significant impacts on traffic conditions, road safety and emissions, as well as overall reshaping travel behaviour. Compared with a private autonomous vehicle, a shared automated vehicle (SAV) is associated with different willingness-to-adopt and willingness-to-pay characteristics. An important aspect of future SAV adoption is the presence of other passengers in the SAV-often people unknown to the cotravellers. This study presents a cross-country exploration of user preferences and WTP calculations regarding mode choice between a private non-autonomous vehicle, and private and shared autonomous vehicles. To explore user preferences, the study launched a survey in seven European countries, including a stated-preference experiment of user choices. To model and quantify the effect of travel mode attributes and socio-demographic characteristics, the study employs a mixed logit model. The model results were the basis for calculating willingness-to-pay values for all countries and travel modes, and provide insight into the significant heterogeneous, gender-wise effect of cotravellers in the choice to use an SAV. The study results highlight the importance of analysis of the effect of SAV attributes and shared-ride conditions on the future acceptance and adoption rates of such services.

AB As one of the challenging tasks of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles systems, the realization of target hunting is the great significance. The multiple autonomous underwater vehicle target hunting is studied in this article. In some research, because the hunting members cannot reach the hunting point at the same time, the hunting time is long or the target escapes. To improve the efficiency of the target hunting, the leader-follower formation algorithm is introduced. Firstly, the task is assigned based on the distance between the autonomous underwater vehicle and the target. Then, the autonomous underwater vehicles with the same task are formed based on leader-follower mode, and the formation is kept to track the target. In the final capture phase, multiple autonomous underwater vehicle system use angle matching algorithm to round up target. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively accomplish the target hunting task, save the hunting time, and avoid the target escape. Compared with the bioinspired neural network algorithm, the proposed algorithm shows better performance.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles is a disruptive technology that has the potential to transform the current transportation system by reducing traffic accidents and enhancing driving safety. One major challenge of building such a system is how to realize effective and efficient cooperative perception among vehicles, which enables them to share local (raw or processed) perception data with each other or roadside infrastructures through wireless communications. As machine learning techniques become prevalent in autonomous vehicles, particularly in their perception subsystem, we articulate the possibility to design a machine-learning-enabled cooperative perception system for connected autonomous vehicles. Not only are the research challenges in designing cooperative perception presented, but we also focus on how to reduce communication and data processing latency in order to meet the stringent time requirements posed by autonomous driving applications. The article outlines the research challenges and opportunities in designing cooperative perception for autonomous vehicles, leveraging the recent research outcomes from machine learning, feature map quantification, millimeter-wave communications, and vehicular edge computing.

AB This article investigates an enhanced optimal robust time-delay stabilizer for an autonomous underwater vehicle in the descriptor model. Time-delay, model uncertainty, and actuator saturation constraint are some practical challenges in autonomous underwater vehicle controller design. In this regard, an appropriate autonomous underwater vehicle descriptor model is obtained, and sufficient stabilization conditions are determined in the terms of linear matrix inequality. The obtained criterion guarantees the system to be regular, impulse-free, and stable. Meanwhile, the delay-dependent and rate-dependent conditions are taken into account. Furthermore, uncertainty and time-delay are time-variant. This method includes a tuning factor for practical design aspects and tradeoff among desired requirements. Also, as an essential general requirement in non-linear systems, the maximal estimate of the attraction domain is proposed as an optimization problem. Numerical examples and simulations illustrate that the proposed methods are effective and useful in less conservative results. The technique can be generalized and applied to the most conventional autonomous underwater vehicles.

ID NETWORK; FRAMEWORK
AB Traffic light-free intersection control is envisioned to alleviate congestion and manage vehicles intelligently. With the help of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication and edge computing (EC), vehicles are instructed to cross the intersection with high vehicle safety and traffic efficiency without traffic lights. However, unstable channel conditions can lead to the reduction of traveling safety. In this paper, we propose a robust autonomous intersection control (AIC) approach with global optimization scheduling, which protects connected autonomous vehicles from collision under any channel conditions while achieving decent traffic efficiency. In particular, we propose an AIC model that gives vehicles certain autonomy under centralized control to ensure the traveling safety in case of some emergencies. By conducting an interference graph, we simplify the AIC problem as a weighted maximal clique problem with restriction. To improve the fairness and efficiency in terms of vehicle passage, multiple factors such as travel delay, traffic of the current lane and passengers' desired speed are considered. Furthermore, we propose a heuristic algorithm to search the solution space. For further optimization, a particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed, achieving a near-optimal result with adjustable overhead. Finally, we build the simulation model and conduct a comparative performance evaluation. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme.

AB Perception is the fundamental task of any autonomous driving system, which gathers all the necessary information about the surrounding environment of the moving vehicle. The decision-making system takes the perception data as input and makes the optimum decision given that scenario, which maximizes the safety of the passengers. This paper surveyed recent literature on autonomous vehicle perception (AVP) by focusing on two primary tasks: Semantic Segmentation and Object Detection. Both tasks play an important role as a vital component of the vehicle's navigation system. A comprehensive overview of deep learning for perception and its decision-making process based on images and LiDAR point clouds is discussed. We discussed the sensors, benchmark datasets, and simulation tools widely used in semantic segmentation and object detection tasks, especially for autonomous driving. This paper acts as a road map for current and future research in AVP, focusing on models, assessment, and challenges in the field.

AB Small satellites and autonomous vehicles have greatly evolved in the last few decades. Hundreds of small satellites have been launched with increasing functionalities, in the last few years. Likewise, numerous autonomous vehicles have been built, with decreasing costs and form-factor payloads. Here we focus on combining these two multifaceted assets in an incremental way, with an ultimate goal of alleviating the logistical expenses in remote oceanographic operations. The first goal is to create a highly reliable and constantly available communication link for a network of autonomous vehicles, taking advantage of the small satellite lower cost, with respect to conventional spacecraft, and its higher flexibility. We have developed a test platform as a proving ground for this network, by integrating a satellite software defined radio on an unmanned air vehicle, creating a system of systems, and several tests have been run successfully, over land. As soon as the satellite is fully operational, we will start to move towards a cooperative network of autonomous vehicles and small satellites, with application in maritime operations, both in-situ and remote sensing.

AB Ethical issues remain a significant concern for future large-scale deployment of autonomous vehicles. Although machine ethics have been developed for a few decades, ethical decision making in autonomous driving imposes more complex and emerging challenges to which some dedicated efforts from academia, policymakers, and automakers have been devoted in the past few years. This paper reviews the efforts and progress associated with the various aspects of ethical challenges in autonomous vehicles. Based on the critical review, it is clear that a consistent solution for ethical challenges does not currently exist and recommendations are provided, to potentially encourage the involving players to collaborate to tackle the remaining challenges.

AB Currently, the automotive industry has entered a period of considerable advancement, shifting towards the development of safe, comfortable, and connected autonomous vehicles. However, the need for real-time sensing, computation, and communication may lead to information overflow in autonomous cars, resulting in data redundancy. Furthermore, anticipating traffic conditions beyond a vehicle's field of view can be quite difficult owing to the restricted range of communication systems. To solve these problems, digital twin systems have been developed for autonomous driving environments. Because autonomous vehicles are driven on open public road networks, this function may jeopardize vehicles, user-identifying information, and sensitive data. Hence, an authentication scheme that can be deployed in digital-twin-enabled autonomous vehicle environments is needed. In this study, we propose a privacy-preserving authentication mechanism. To establish the security of the proposed method, we performed a formal security analysis based on the real-or-random model. Furthermore, we assessed the performance of the proposed scheme, and our results demonstrate that it can reduce calculation and transmission costs.

Although a great number of underwater vehicles have been developed, it is still difficult for them to realize agile and uninjured sea organism capturing autonomously. This paper is proposed to investigate the current state of art about underwater autonomous and dexterous operation robot, underwater autonomous environmental perception, underwater vehicle-manipulator system modeling and coordinated control, target uninjured grasp; in order to analyze the difficulties and research methodologies for the robot development of sea organism autonomous and uninjured capture. To make analysis on the organism autonomous capture process, this article has presented two different open frame underwater vehicles, the absorption type one and the grasp type one. Analysis including autonomous visual search and detection process, acceleration-level task priority redundancy resolution approach for trajectory planning and grasp capture. Experiments with the organism autonomous grasp and absorption process have both been purposed.

AB As the widespread usage of autonomous vehicles is closer to becoming a reality, substantial consideration should be paid to the extent to which individuals choose vehicular mobility tools. The purpose of this study is to examine vehicle ownership models to better understand the adoption of vehicles by considering some factors such as liability issues, cost, safety, and environmental characteristics. 323 respondents were recruited from Istanbul, Turkey to complete the stated choice experiment through a web-based survey. Multinomial logit and Heteroskedastic mixed logit models were estimated to unravel users' preferences concerning the selection of autonomous vehicles with distinction among private, shared, and ride-hailing vehicles. Results indicate that the adoption of those vehicles varied concerning the aforementioned characteristics, and these findings could help decision-makers to develop a vehicular mobility system for future transportation dynamics.

AB Autonomous driving technology, in which cars recognise their surroundings and drive by way of mechanical control, has attracted much attention. However, before the introduction of autonomous driving technology, there will be a mixture of autonomous and non-autonomous vehicles, which will require a traffic operation management strategy to ensure the safety and operational efficiency of the mixed traffic flow. In response, an operation plan is proposed here to design and operate a managed lane to minimise friction between autonomous and non-autonomous vehicles in the commercialisation phase of autonomous vehicles (AVs). To evaluate this AV managed-lane operation strategy, effectiveness measurements relation to safety, operation efficiency and the environment were derived by conducting a simulation analysis using Vissim software. Then, a value function was developed that reflects the three measurements and their importance weighting values. Using this approach, the paper provides a strategy of optimal AV managed-lane operation that can increase operational efficiency and safety in expressway on/off-ramp areas.

AB Driver behavior models have been used as input to self-coaching, accident prevention studies, and developing driver-assisting systems. In recent years, driver behavior recognition has revolutionized autonomous vehicles (AVs) and traffic management studies. This comprehensive survey provides an up-to-date review of the different driver behavior models and modeling approaches. In heterogeneous streets where humans and autonomous vehicles operate simultaneously, predicting the intent and action of human drivers is crucial for AVs with the help of wireless communication and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Therefore, the review also summarizes the applications of driver behavior modeling (DBM) for effective behavior recognition and human-like AV driving. Moreover, the review also covers the application of DBM in capturing behaviors of complex dynamic driving tasks. In this review, we solely cover car-following (CF) and lane-changing (LC) maneuvers.

AB Autonomous rides on public roads performed by a seeing road, vehicle under normal traffic conditions have been demonstrated on German Autobahnen since the beginning of 1992. Meanwhile, the new goal of autonomous driving on roads of lower order has been approached by including the turn-off at intersections. Tests have been performed on a specially designed test track including curves with radii from 35-100 m and an intersection. This paper gives a short overview on the applied algorithms as well as the control structure of the system which was developed at the Universitat der Bundeswehr Munchen. A summary of experimental results for autonomous rides points out the applicability of the approach.

AB The most well-known research on driverless vehicles at the moment is connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), which reflects the future path for the self driving field. The development of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is not only increasing logistics operations, but it is also opening up new possibilities for the industry's sustainable growth. In this review, we will explore the cloud-controlled wireless network-based model of cyber physical aspect of the autonomous vehicle, which is coupled with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Additionally, this model is Internet of Things (IoT) managed and AI-based, with a blockchain-based security mechanism. Additionally, we'll focus on lateral control in autonomous driving, particularly the lane change maneuver, taking social behavior into account. Here, we briefly reviewed Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, which is carried out by on-board sensors and connected wireless medium that enhance the lane departure processes while retaining human driver behavior relying on obstacle avoidance.

AB In recent research activities, autonomous vehicles and self-driving technology have gained lot of attention among scientists. The idea of autonomous vehicles can be anticipated in the 1920s when the design of the first radio-controlled vehicles was in progress. Autonomous vehicles are going to be the trend of the future in this modern era of automation and technology. In this paper various autonomous driving aspects, highlighting the software stack and hardware components are discussed. The software architecture covers mainly robot operating system (ROS), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and OpenCV frameworks, along with the calibration of sensors and cameras. The paper also discussed about simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) based-path tracking, computer vision-based controller, and intelligent object avoidance. Further, point cloud, ground, radius, and raycast filters was implemented to distinguish between the real-time objects, ground, and its own parts or obstacle shadows. The paper highlights the overall hardware modules responsible for controlling the car.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Autonomous Driving (AD) introduces dramatic changes to the way we travel. This emerging technology has the potential to impact the transportation sector across a wide array of categories including safety, efficiency, congestion, legislation, and travel behavior. In this survey, we review the main issues involved in AD as discussed in the literature, and shed light on topics that we consider requiring further development based on Google Scholar and the Web of Science (WoS) data base. The paper also provides the results of research trends related to Autonomous Driving based on analysis of the number of search results listed in google trends. According to our research, the fields of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Cloud (V2C) networking are of higher interest due to the technological gaps and standardization processes. In addition, cyber and security research is in acceleration due to its importance.

AB To design an automatic steering controller with high performance for autonomous vehicle, it is necessary to have a precise model of the lateral dynamics with respect to the steering command input. This paper presents an empirical modeling of the steering system for an autonomous vehicle. The steering system here is represented by three individual transfer function models: a steering wheel actuator model from the steering command input to the steering angle of the shaft, a dynamic model between the steering angle and the yaw rate of the vehicle, and a dynamic model between the steering command and the lateral deviation of vehicle. These models are identified using frequency response data. Experiments were performed using a real vehicle. It is shown that the resulting identified models have been well fitted to the experimental data.

AB Recent advancements in Intelligent Transportation Systems suggest that the roads will gradually be filled with autonomous vehicles that are able to drive themselves while communicating with each other and the infrastructure. As a representative driving pattern of autonomous vehicles, the platooning technology has great potential for reducing transport costs by lowering fuel consumption and increasing traffic efficiency. In this paper, to improve the driving efficiency of autonomous vehicular platoon in terms of fuel consumption, a path planning scheme is envisioned using deep reinforcement learning on the network edge node. At first, the system model of autonomous vehicles platooning is given on the common highway. Next, a joint optimization problem is developed considering the task deadline and fuel consumption of each vehicle in the platoon. After that, a path determination strategy employing deep reinforcement learning is designed for the platoon. To make the readers readily follow, a case study is also presented with instantiated parameters. Numerical results shows that our proposed model could significantly reduce the fuel consumption of vehicle platoons while ensuring their task deadlines.

ID TRACKING
AB In case of emergency braking in danger, autonomous vehicle usually uses electronic stability control system to maintain the dynamic stability of the vehicle, and by adjusting the steering system, the vehicle can realize autonomous driving. However, when the autonomous vehicle is in emergency braking on the split-mu road, due to the inconsistent adhesion coefficient on both sides of the road, the inconsistency of tire force will not only damage the dynamic stability, but also make the vehicle deviate from the planned trajectory. Because the path tracking algorithm of autonomous vehicle needs to detect the trajectory error first, it will lead to the time delay of trajectory error correction, and its correction ability will weaken with the decrease of speed, so that the vehicle's trajectory will deviate unilaterally. Thus, the tracking accuracy is reduced and the driving safety is endangered. This paper proposes a dynamic coordinated control strategy based on dynamics and kinematics. In response to the rapid changes in lateral disturbances, a flexible control transfer mechanism based on vehicle status is constructed, realize dynamic coordinated control based on path tracking algorithm and active steering algorithm. While improving the lateral stability, the trajectory error is reduced.

AB The prospect of autonomous vehicles (AVs) offers the possibility that a household could reduce household owned vehicles to a single vehicle. At the same time, with AVs, a Shared Autonomous Vehicle (SAV) system will rise as a primary mode of serving travel demands. This study aims to model households? activity/travel decisions using both household owned AVs as well as readily available SAVs to perform daily activities. We formulate the Household Activity Pattern Problem with Autonomous Vehicles and Ride Sourcing (HAPPAV-RS), as a mixed integer linear program. The model generates an optimal activity/travel patterns for household members under spatial and temporal constraints. The model can capture driverless operations such as AV pick-up and dropoff, parking availability, empty trips and ridesharing among household members, as well as the use of SAVs with the request waiting time. A decomposition method is used to solve the NP-hard problem HAPPAV-RS. scenarios on using AVs and SAVs with different travel mode availability, AV/SAV cost and SAV waiting time are designed to enable sensitivity analysis. Various travel metrics such as activity pattern feasibility, household?s total travel disutility, travel mode VMT and AV-SAV trip coverage are reported.

AB Fully automated self-driving cars, with expected benefits including improved road safety, are closer to becoming a reality. Thus, attention has turned to gauging public perceptions of these autonomous vehicles. To date, surveys have focused on the public as potential passengers of autonomous cars, overlooking other road users who would interact with them. Comparisons with perceptions of other existing vehicles are also lacking. This study surveyed almost 1000 participants on their perceptions, particularly with regards to safety and acceptance of autonomous vehicles. Overall, results revealed that autonomous cars were perceived as a "somewhat low risk" form of transport and, while concerns existed, there was little opposition to the prospect of their use on public roads. However, compared to human-operated cars, autonomous cars were perceived differently depending on the road user perspective: more risky when a passenger yet less risky when a pedestrian. Autonomous cars were also perceived as more risky than existing autonomous trains. Gender, age and risk-taking had varied relationships with the perceived risk of different vehicle types and general attitudes towards autonomous cars. For instance, males and younger adults displayed greater acceptance. Whilst their adoption of this autonomous technology would seem societally beneficial due to these groups' greater propensity for taking road user risks, behaviours linked with poorer road safety other results suggested it might be premature to draw conclusions on risk-taking and user acceptance. Future studies should therefore continue to investigate people's perceptions from multiple perspectives, taking into account various road user viewpoints and individual characteristics.

ID SAFETY
AB Autonomous driving systems (ADS) in recent years have been the subject of focus, evolving as one of the major mobility disruptors and being a potential candidate for deployment in urban cities due to urbanization. ADS is the system within the Autonomous Vehicle (AV) that enables automation. The different ADS technologies that enable autonomous vehicles have reached a certain maturity that no longer focus on technological deployment, but rather on the safe deployment on public roads. However, existing standards that validate functional safety and Risk Assessment (RA) may not be sufficient to tackle the increased complexity of ADS compared to traditional vehicles. This demand in ADS safety is exponentially increasing in tandem with the increase of AV automation levels. ADS are exposed to diverse environmental conditions and therefore subjected to operational risks while attempting to mimic the human driver responses. Moreover, the recent use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the industry further shapes the way how ADS development will become in the future. This paper explains the importance of RA coverage for AV and provides a comparison and summary of existing RA methodologies. Thereafter, a recommendation of RAs for AV as potential solutions in meeting ISO 26262 and ISO/PAS 21448 standards.

AB We present a novel framework for collision free assisted navigation of a semi-autonomous vehicle in complex unknown environments with moving and steady obstacles. In the proposed system, a semi-autonomous vehicle is guided by a human operator and an automatic reactive navigator. The autonomous reactive navigation block takes control from the human operator in situations where there is the danger of collision with obstacle. A mathematically rigorous analysis of the proposed approach is provided. The performance of the proposed assisted navigation system is demonstrated via experiments with a real semi-autonomous hospital bed and extensive computer simulations.

AB The article discusses the issue of how potential users perceive automated and autonomous vehicle (AV) technology, emphasizing that its sophistication and reliability are crucial for the safety of driving vehicles with a level of automation starting from the third degree. Safety plays a significant role in determining public acceptance of autonomous vehicles. Without the acceptance of potential users and their willingness to use smart electric vehicles, it is challenging to talk about the rapid implementation of autonomous vehicles, despite their undeniable benefits. The article presents an analysis of survey results regarding public opinion in Poland on this matter. The survey utilized various methods, including CAWI surveys, Focus Group Interviews (FGI), and Individual In-depth Interviews (IDI). The CAWI survey involved 1067 respondents in Poland, with a 95% confidence level and a maximum margin of error of 3%, representing a representative sample of the Polish population aged 16 and above. The article examines issues that illustrate respondents' acceptance levels concerning perceived security and trust in AVs. The obtained results are compared with opinions from surveys conducted in other countries. Additionally, the article attempts to identify reasons for the low assessment of the technologies among respondents and proposes measures to boost confidence in automated and autonomous vehicles.

AB Autonomous driving is one of the most interesting fields of research, with a number of important applications, like agricultural, military and, most significantly, safety. This paper addresses the problem of designing a general purpose path planner and its associated low level control for autonomous vehicles operating in unknown environments. Different kinds of inputs, like the results of obstacle detection, ditch localization, lane detection, and global path planning information are merged together using potential fields to build a representation of the environment in real-time; kinematically feasible trajectories, based on vehicle dynamics, are generated on a cost map. This approach demonstrated both flexibility and reliability for vehicle driving in very different environments, including extreme road conditions. This controller was extensively tested during VIAC, the VisLab Intercontinental Autonomous Challenge, a 13,000 km long test for intelligent vehicle applications. The results, collected during the development stage and the experiment itself, are presented in the final part of this article. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper describes a functional perspective-based probabilistic fault detection and diagnostic algorithm of an autonomous vehicle using a longitudinal kinematic model. The relative displacement and velocity between the subject vehicle and a preceding vehicle was obtained by a radar installed in front of the autonomous vehicle. The obtained relative values were used to control the longitudinal behavior of the autonomous vehicle, the longitudinal acceleration of which was obtained from an internal sensor. In order to detect and diagnose actual faults in the obtained values, such as relative displacement, velocity, and acceleration, a fault detection and diagnostic algorithm for the longitudinal control of the autonomous vehicle was developed using a sliding mode observer and predictive function. The probabilistic analysis of fault signals was conducted using the constructed sliding mode observer and predictive function. The actual driving data of the vehicle preceding the subject vehicle was used for the rational performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm. The performance evaluation was conducted in the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. The evaluation results showed that the proposed fault detection and diagnostic algorithm can stochastically detect and diagnose applied fault signals.

AB Vehicle automation opens opportunities toward the improvement of people, planet, profit value in applications on distribution centres (DCs). Despite vision and drive for innovation in logistics, the lack of knowledge prevents the application of autonomous applications. Intelligent Truck Applications in Logistics (INTRALOG) contributes to this deficit and generates valuable insights for a future application in public environments. Current operational automated guided truck applications are bound to fixed infrastructure and do neither operate in the public domain nor offer opportunities to do so. Nowadays, in-vehicle intelligent systems are focused on driver support, opening opportunities such as truck platooning. INTRALOG cross-borders on DCs in relatively low-complex traffic environment, bridging the gap between autonomous driving in the public domain. The multi-agent system developed within INTRALOG aligns logistical movements on DCs, controlling single or double articulated container trailers (longer and heavier vehicle) between the public parking area and cross-docks. This study elaborates on the experiments on automated manoeuvring on a DC with single (SAVs) and double articulated vehicles (DAVs). The experiments comply with business requirements, e.g. manoeuvrability, time to dock and positioning accuracy. The research focuses on the effects of these aspects and control strategies of SAVs and DAVs.

AB Autonomous vehicles promise to improve traffic safety while, at the same time, increase fuel efficiency and reduce congestion. They represent the main trend in future intelligent transportation systems. This paper concentrates on the planning problem of autonomous vehicles in traffic. We model the interaction between the autonomous vehicle and the environment as a stochastic Markov decision process (MOP) and consider the driving style of an expert driver as the target to be learned. The road geometry is taken into consideration in the MDP model in order to incorporate more diverse driving styles. The desired, expert-like driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle is obtained as follows: First, we design the reward function of the corresponding MDP and determine the optimal driving strategy for the autonomous vehicle using reinforcement learning techniques. Second, we collect a number of demonstrations from an expert driver and learn the optimal driving strategy based on data using inverse reinforcement learning. The unknown reward function of the expert driver is approximated using a deep neural-network (DNN). We clarify and validate the application of the maximum entropy principle (MEP) to learn the DNN reward function, and provide the necessary derivations for using the maximum entropy principle to learn a parameterized feature (reward) function. Simulated results demonstrate the desired driving behaviors of an autonomous vehicle using both the reinforcement learning and inverse reinforcement learning techniques. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Such an examination is speculative and uncertain, both because the growth of autonomous transportation is unclear and because the expenditure effects depend on linkages between autonomous transportation and other market developments. The potential expenditure effects are categorized into three groups immediate demand effects, production of public services, and longer-run indirect effects. The implications seem largest relatively for county governments, where they may impact nearly two-thirds of spending.

AB Shared mobility is a viable choice to improve the connectivity of lower-density neighbourhoods or suburbs that lack high-frequency public transportation services. In addition, its integration with new forms of powertrain and autonomous technologies can achieve more sustainable and efficient transportation. This study compares four shared-mobility technologies in suburban areas: the Internal Combustion Engine, Battery Electric, and two Autonomous Electric Vehicle scenarios, for various passenger capacities ranging from three to fifteen. The study aims to provide policymakers, transportation planners, and transit providers with insights into the potential costs and benefits as well as system configurations of shared mobility in a suburban context. A vehicle routing problem with time windows was applied using the J-Horizon software to optimize the costs of serving existing intra-community demand. The results indicate a similar fleet composition for Battery Electric and Autonomous Electric fleets. Furthermore, the resulting fleet for all four technologies is dominated by larger vehicle capacities. Due to the large share of driver cost in the total cost, the savings using a fleet of Autonomous Electric Vehicles are predicted to be 68% and 70%, respectively, compared to Internal Combustion and Battery Electric fleets.

AB With the development of vehicle automation and sharing economy, a mix of human-driven and autonomous vehicles can be expected in the next few decades, which means the conventional vehicles, carsharing, autonomous vehicles (AV) and shared AVs will coexist, affecting the way of travel. AVs, especially combined with shared use, may contribute to reduce or solve some of the present most intractable urban problems such as traffic congestion, crashes and wasted use of urban spaces. Given the emerging trend of new mobility options, understanding the decision of people in owning a private human-driven vehicle or private AV versus using a shared AV or joining car sharing would have important indications for policy makers to reduce car ownership in general. Therefore, this paper is devoted to gain insight into individuals' propensity for purchasing an autonomous vehicle or using shared (autonomous) cars. Based on the data collected using a stated choice experiment, we estimated a random parameter error component model to identify the possible heterogeneity between individuals in the preference and possible correlations between various mobility alternatives. Results show substantial heterogeneity exists among individuals in their preferences. People in general prefer to keep their current car or buy an AV rather than to use shared cars, and shared AVs are more favorable than the traditional car sharing. Regarding the shared AVs, people are not only concerned about the operational costs and hourly rate, but also vehicle availability and access time. Moreover, younger people are more willing to accept these new mobility options.

AB In autonomous driving, IEEE 802.11p-based vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is considered for overcoming the intrinsic limitations of sensors and supporting safety applications. In this letter, we evaluate the effectiveness of relevant awareness control approaches, such as ETSI DMG, IVTRC, and POSACC, to support the V2V-based overtaking application in autonomous driving. For this, we assess the incident detection capability of the overtaking application when it is running with messages gathered from these approaches, considering packet losses due to channel fading. Simulations show that POSACC is more effective than the remaining approaches for detecting unsafe overtaking maneuvers in different operating conditions.

AB Autonomous navigation without external GNSS aiding is crucial for some kinds of land vehicle applications, such as military vehicles and unmanned vehicles navigation under GNSS denied environments. A typical solution for autonomous navigation can be achieved by integrating Inertial Navigation System (INS) and odometer, where the odometer can provide velocity aiding for INS. The INS/odometer integration approach can dramatically improve the navigation performances compared with the standalone INS approach, however its positioning error is still gradually accumulating with time because of lacking external position correction. This paper proposes an approach to aid the INS/odometer integration by using vision positioning, where a UAV is used to carry the vision camera and helps to realize the positioning of the vehicle by image matching. The UAV vision positioning acts a role like GNSS and provides constant position correction for INS/odometer integration. A dual-rate Kalman filter is proposed and utilized to realize the data fusing of vision, INS and odometer. Simulation and filed tests show that the proposed approach can dramatically improve the autonomous navigation performances for land vehicles.

AB Currently, the existing vehicle-centric semi-autonomous driving modules do not consider the driver's situation and emotions. In an autonomous driving environment, when changing to manual driving, human-machine interface and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are essential to assist vehicle driving. This study proposes a human-machine interface that considers the driver's situation and emotions to enhance the ADAS. A 1D convolutional neural network model based on multimodal bio-signals is used and applied to control semi-autonomous vehicles. The possibility of semi-autonomous driving is confirmed by classifying four driving scenarios and controlling the speed of the vehicle. In the experiment, by using a driving simulator and hardware-in-the-loop simulation equipment, we confirm that the response speed of the driving assistance system is 351.75 ms and the system recognizes four scenarios and eight emotions through bio-signal data.

AB Comprehensive research on the wireless power transfer technology of autonomous underwater vehicles is necessary to address the issue of significant energy loss in such vehicles during wireless power transfer. Previous analysis on factors that affect wireless power transfer in seawater environment demonstrated that the eddy current loss generated during transmission and offset of the coupling mechanism are the main factors that degrade the efficiency. In this study, existing literature on wireless power transfer for autonomous underwater vehicles in recent years is reviewed, and it is concluded that the energy loss during underwater wireless power transfer can be effectively reduced through coupling mechanism optimization, adaptive control, and docking device design. This study analyses the challenges of low-loss wireless power transfer for autonomous underwater vehicles and the prospects for future development trends and research areas, providing a reference for realizing efficient and flexible energy supply for autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB The increasing number of vehicles, the excessive use of fossil fuels, and the related safety and environmental issues have motivated studies on autonomous vehicles and Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs). In this article, we focus on the control of the powertrain energy management for an autonomous HEV. A new powertrain control strategy is enabled by leveraging one of the uniqueness in the powertrain management of an autonomous vehicle, i.e., the instantaneous power generated by the powertrain does not need to exactly follow the power demand by the vehicle motion controller. This is referred to as flexible power demand, which adds an extra degree of freedom to the powertrain energy management, and can lead to control design achieving better fuel economy. The powertrain control is then formulated under the Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) framework, and the power flexibility is incorporated in the ADP formulation. At last, an example of multiple connected HEVs following a leader vehicle operating in an off-road scenario is given to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.

AB This study proposes an algorithm for fault detection and mitigation of mixed autonomous and human-driven vehicle platoons based on transmissibility identification. This work is motivated by the fact that on-road human-drivers' behaviour is unknown and difficult to be predicted. Transmissibility operators are mathematical operators that relate one subset of outputs to another in the same system. The transmissibility superiority is represented in the in-dependency on the system excitation signals. We reformulate the system dynamics to render the system inputs, external disturbances, as well as the human-drivers' behaviour along with any other nonlinearities as independent excitation signals on the system. Therefore, the transmissibility operators become independent of the human-drivers' behaviour and robust against external disturbances. Transmissibilities are then applied to detect and localize physical and cyber faults within the platoon. Then these faults are mitigated using a transmissibility-based sliding mode controller. The controller stability and the string stability are investigated while the controller is active and the faults are mitigated. We validate the proposed algorithm on a model of the platoon obtained using the bond graph approach. Moreover, we apply the proposed algorithm experimentally to a platoon consisting of three robots (i.e. two autonomous robots and a human-driven robot), that is connected using wireless communications. Note to Practitioners-The existence of connected autonomous vehicles depends greatly on the smooth transition between the current on-road human-driven vehicles to autonomous vehicles. The typical methods of securing dynamic systems depend on estimating the system behaviour and responses. Increasing the number of autonomous vehicles on roads necessitates the typical securing techniques to estimate the human-drivers' behaviour. Thus, securing the connected autonomous vehicles during this transition is challenging since the on-road human-driver behavior is unknown and difficult to be estimated. Moreover, connected autonomous vehicles should adapt to their environment while maintaining their role within the autonomous platoon. This adaptation includes adapting to the unknown human-driver behaviour. This inspired the authors to develop the proposed transmissibility-based fault mitigation. The proposed technique is shown to be able to handle unknown human-driver behaviors, different driving conditions such as road irregularities and different weather conditions, and different physical and cyber faults (i.e., in the vehicles or in the communication links). The platoon stability is then investigated while the faults are mitigated, and shown to guarantee the platoon stability.

AB We address the problem of environmental contour line tracking for a class of autonomous vehicles. A reference velocity is designed for the autonomous vehicles to do contour line tracking. Based on Lashall invariance principle, an ideal controller is designed for the vehicle with ideal model and ideal information about the environmental concentration function to track the desired contour line. For the vehicle with possibly modeling uncertainty, we combine a neural controller containing a wavelet neural network (WNN) identifier with a robust control to construct a robust adaptive WNN control for the vehicle to track the desired environmental contour line. Then we give theoretical proof of the efficiency of the designed robust adaptive WNN control. Simulation results and conclusion are presented and discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

DT Article
ID AUTOMATED VEHICLES
AB Two emerging technologies in the automotive domain are autonomous vehicles and V2X communication. Even though these technologies are usually considered separately, their combination enables two key cooperative features: sensing and maneuvering. Cooperative sensing allows vehicles to exchange information gathered from local sensors. Cooperative maneuvering permits inter-vehicle coordination of maneuvers. These features enable the creation of cooperative autonomous vehicles, which may greatly improve traffic safety, efficiency, and driver comfort. The first generation V2X communication systems with the corresponding standards, such as Release 1 from ETSI, have been designed mainly for driver warning applications in the context of road safety and traffic efficiency, and do not target use cases for autonomous driving. This article presents the design of core functionalities for cooperative autonomous driving and addresses the required evolution of communication standards in order to support a selected number of autonomous driving use cases. The article describes the targeted use cases, identifies their communication requirements, and analyzes the current V2X communication standards from ETSI for missing features. The result is a set of specifications for the amendment and extension of the standards in support of cooperative autonomous driving.

AB A systematic review is provided on artificial agent methodologies applicable to control engineering of autonomous vehicles and robots. The paper focuses on some fundamentals that make a machine autonomous: decision making that involves modelling the environment and forming data abstractions for symbolic processing and logic-based reasoning. Most relevant capabilities such as navigation, autonomous path planning, path following control, and communications, that directly affect decision making, are treated as basic skills of agents. Although many autonomous vehicles have been engineered in the past without using the agent-oriented approach, most decision making onboard of vehicles is similar to or can be classified as some kind of agent architecture, even if in a naive form. First the ANSI standard of intelligent systems is recalled then a summary of the fundamental types of possible agent architectures for autonomous vehicles are presented, starting from reactive, through layered, to advanced architectures in terms of beliefs, goals, and intentions. The review identifies some missing links between computer science results on discrete agents and engineering results of continuous world sensing, actuation, and path planning. In this context design tools for 'abstractions programming' are identified as needed to fill in the gap between logic-based reasoning and sensing. Finally, research is reviewed on autonomous vehicles in water, on the ground, in the air, and in space with comments on their methods of decision making. One of the main conclusions of this review is that standardization of decision making through agent architectures is desirable for the future of intelligent vehicle developments and their legal certification.

TI Impacts of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles on Traffic Flow with

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

ID FRAMEWORK; MODEL; VALIDATION; SIMULATION; BEHAVIOR
AB Connected and automated vehicle technologies are expected to significantly contribute in improving mobility and safety. As connected and autonomous vehicles have not been used in practice at large scale, there are still some uncertainties in relation to their applications. Therefore, researchers utilize traffic simulation tools to model the presence of these vehicles. There are several studies on the impacts of vehicle connectivity and automation at the segment level. However, only a few studies have investigated these impacts on traffic flow at the network level. Most of these studies consider a uniform distribution of connected or autonomous vehicles over the network. They also fail to consider the interactions between heterogeneous drivers, with and without connectivity, and autonomous vehicles at the network level. Therefore, this study aims to realistically observe the impacts of these emerging technologies on traffic flow at the network level by incorporating adaptive fundamental diagrams in a mesoscopic simulation tool. The adaptive fundamental diagram concept considers spatially and temporally varying distributions of different vehicle types with heterogeneous drivers. Furthermore, this study considers the intersection capacity variations and fundamental diagram adjustments for arterial links resulting from the presence of different vehicle types and driver classes. The proposed methodology is applied to a large-scale network of Chicago. The results compare network fundamental diagrams and hysteresis loop areas for different proportions of connected and autonomous vehicles. In addition to quantifying impacts of connected and autonomous vehicles, the results demonstrate the impacts of various factors associated with these vehicles on traffic flow at the network level.

AB The number of studies on autonomous vehicles has increased over recent years. Many of these studies have indicated the importance of an external Human-Machine Interface of communication (eHMI) on autonomous vehicles to indicate their intentions to other road users. Using an experimental design, we compared three eHMIs coupled to three road infrastructures to observe pedestrians' crossing behavior and collect their feelings about different vehicle types. Our results showed that the eHMIs influence the pedestrians' decision to cross the street, confirming the importance of setting up eHMIs. The proportion of pedestrians who crossed in front of the autonomous vehicles was more significant for vehicles equipped with an eHMI than vehicles without an eHMI. In 10% of cases, pedestrians used circumvention strategies rather than crossing in front of a vehicle without an eHMI. This behavior was more often observed when there was no protected infrastructure. Finally, while our objective data failed to indicate whether a specific eHMI is better accepted than another, the subjective data on the participants' preferences provided some promising ideas for further studies and the eHMI final implementation.

AB In this paper, the problem of decision making for autonomous vehicles changing lanes is addressed by formulating multiple games in normal form for pairs of agents. This formulation generates the optimal action for the Ego vehicle at a given state and does not consider global optimality for all agents. The payoff matrices of the games are designed based on a user-defined set of rules. The constant parameters of these payoffs are then adjusted using neural learning to generate optimal behavior among the vehicles. An algorithm integrating deep reinforcement learning and game theory, regarded as Nash Q-learning, is included in the decision-making scheme. The applicability of the proposed method in a lane-changing scenario is tested via simulation.

AB Due to the development of the modern scientific technology, autonomous vehicles may realize to connect with each other and share the information collected from each vehicle. An improved forward considering car-following model was proposed with mean expected velocity field to describe the autonomous vehicles flow behavior. The new model has three key parameters: adjustable sensitivity, strength factor and mean expected velocity field size. Two lemmas and one theorem were proven as criteria for judging the stability of homogeneous autonomous vehicles flow. Theoretical results show that the greater parameters means larger stability regions. A series of numerical simulations were carried out to check the stability and fundamental diagram of autonomous flow. From the numerical simulation results, the profiles, hysteresis loop and density waves of the autonomous vehicles flow were exhibited. The results show that with increased sensitivity, strength factor or field size the traffic jam was suppressed effectively which are well in accordance with the theoretical results. Moreover, the fundamental diagrams corresponding to three parameters respectively were obtained. It demonstrates that these parameters play almost the same role on traffic flux: i.e. before the critical density the bigger parameter is, the greater flux is and after the critical density, the opposite tendency is. In general, the three parameters have a great influence on the stability and jam state of the autonomous vehicles flow. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Advanced automotive active safety systems, in general, and autonomous vehicles, in particular, rely heavily on visual data to classify and localize objects, such as pedestrians, traffic signs and lights, and nearby cars, to help the corresponding vehicles maneuver safely in their environments. However, the performance of object detection methods could degrade rather significantly in challenging weather scenarios, including rainy conditions. Despite major advancements in the development of deraining approaches, the impact of rain on object detection has largely been understudied, especially in the context of autonomous driving.

AB The most basic requirement for autonomous vehicles is accurate environmental perception. However, the lack of onboard computing resources makes it difficult for such a vehicle to process all environmental information. Through the edge computing technology and 6G networks, vehicles can offload computing tasks to edge servers for execution, which alleviates the problem of insufficient onboard resources. The environmental perception task offloading problem for autonomous vehicles is studied. The purpose is to improve the environmental perception quality through reasonable task offloading. After assigning dynamic priorities to tasks generated by autonomous vehicles, the multi-vehicle and multi-server task offloading process is abstracted as a Markov decision process, and an offloading decision algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning is designed to select edge nodes for task execution to obtain better long-term benefits. The earliest deadline first algorithm is improved to consider the deadline and priority of each task, allowing the edge node to complete more high-priority tasks within the specified time. Experimental results show that the proposed method can guarantee the basic environmental perception requirements of every vehicle, and performs better than existing methods in terms of the total priority of the discarded tasks in each scheduling period and the completion rate of key tasks.

AB Autonomous driving is a breakthrough technology in the automobile and transportation fields. The characteristics of planned trajectories and tracking accuracy affect the development of autonomous driving technology. To improve the measurement accuracy of the vehicle state and realise the online application of predictive control algorithm, an online active set-based longitudinal and lateral model predictive tracking control method of autonomous driving is proposed for electric vehicles. Integrated with the vehicle inertial measurement unit (IMU) and global positioning system (GPS) information, a vehicle state estimator is designed based on an extended Kalman filter. Based on the 3-degree-of-freedom vehicle dynamics model and the curvilinear road coordinate system, the longitudinal and lateral errors dimensionality reduction is carried out. A fast-rolling optimisation algorithm for longitudinal and lateral tracking control of autonomous vehicles is designed and implemented based on convex optimisation, online active set theory and QP solver. Finally, the performance of the proposed tracking control method is verified in the reconstructed curve road scene based on real GPS data. The hardware-in-the-loop simulation results show that the proposed MPC controller has apparent advantages compared with the PID-based controller.</p>

AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology holds great promise for improving the efficiency of traditional vehicle sharing systems. In this paper, we investigate a new vehicle sharing system using AVs, referred to as autonomous vehicle sharing and reservation (AVSR). In such a system, travelers can request AV trips ahead of time and the AVSR system operator will optimally arrange AV pickup and delivery schedules and AV trip chains based on these requests. A linear programming model is proposed to efficiently solve for optimal solutions for AV trip chains and required fleet size through constructed AVSR networks. Case studies show that AVSR can significantly increase vehicle use rate (VUR) and consequentially reduce vehicle ownership significantly. In the meantime, it is found that the actual vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in AVSR systems is not significantly more than that of conventional taxis, despite inevitable empty hauls for vehicle relocation in AVSR systems. The results imply huge potential benefits from AVSR systems on improving mobility and sustainability of our current transportation systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Carpooling and the ride-sharing idea are currently resolving many issues faced by modern societies. The issues regarding the overuse of oil, traffic jams, inefficient use of time, pollution due to overuse of vehicles on the road, and health problems. It is also expected that ride-sharing and carpooling will be more efficient for autonomous vehicles because of their unmanned nature and full-fledged autonomy. When unmanned cars will do the responsibility of carpooling and ride-sharing or car-hailing, many issues regarding booking rides, location sharing, payment handling, and privacy issues must be improved. To cope with these issues, mainly concerning the scheduling of resources, we need effective scheduling techniques to handle all kinds of emotional problems and provide a pollution-free and accident-free environment on autonomous vehicles' roads. Among other approaches, we feel that Data Science provides a perfect opportunity to leverage machine learning models to classify and see what parameters can encourage people to opt for a move towards connected autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we discuss autonomous vehicles, Vehicle-as-a-Service, and their role in reducing CO2 emissions. The dataset used in this study gives insights into the city of Chicago's taxi trips. The dataset includes data about taxi trips, their respective duration, and anonymized data about the passengers. We also discuss some studies by a taxonomy that will identify the gap of an optimal incentive mechanism that will influence users to join carpooling in autonomous cars instead of having their vehicles.

AB Despite the recent advancements in autonomous vehicle technologies, performing safe lane changes and merging in dense traffic environments remains an open challenge. One important question is how to find a space to merge into without placing any vehicle in a collision-prone situation. Moreover, what is the traffic flow impact of doing so? To tackle this issue, we start by adopting a safety definition based on a worst-case braking scenario. We then propose a decentralized controller-agnostic cooperative approach for lane changes that relies only on Vehicle-to-Vehicle communications and guarantees safety. In our method, the merging vehicle operates as having two possible leaders, one in its own lane and one in the destination lane, till the lane change maneuver is completed. Furthermore, the future following vehicle in the destination lane cooperates by acting as if the merging vehicle has already changed lanes. The merging vehicle only performs the lane change maneuver when the gaps are safe. Vehicle-level simulations are used to evaluate the approach in detail for a single lane change maneuver. Then, the method's impact on highway safety and traffic flow is assessed using microscopic traffic simulations based on the commercial software VISSIM. We simulate three types of vehicles: adaptive cruise control equipped vehicles, autonomous vehicles, and connected and autonomous vehicles. The various simulations allow us to identify which improvements are brought by cooperative lane changes. Results indicate that connected and autonomous vehicles can achieve almost zero collision risk in congested and uncongested scenarios while improving traffic flow by 26% in the congested case. However, energy consumption increases significantly in the uncongested scenario. Moreover, our method outperforms an existing cooperative lane -changing method regarding safety and traffic flow. Our simulations with mixed traffic suggest that the proposed method is advantageous only at high penetrations of autonomous vehicles or in congested situations.

Analyzing sensor data for improving autonomous driving safety has become one of the most promising issues in the autonomous vehicles research field. However, representing the sensor data in a machine understandable format for further knowledge processing still remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we introduce ontologies designed for autonomous vehicles and ontology-based knowledge base, which are used for representing knowledge of maps, driving paths, and perceived driving environments. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are developed to improve safety of autonomous vehicles by accessing to the ontology-based knowledge base. The ontologies can be reused and extended for constructing knowledge base for autonomous vehicles as well as for implementing different types of ADAS such as decision making system.

AB This article investigates the problem of event-triggered secure path tracking control of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) under deception attacks. To relieve the burden of the shareable vehicle communication network and to improve the tracking performance in the presence of deception attacks, a learning-based event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is proposed. Different from existing ETMs, the triggering threshold of the proposed mechanism can be dynamically adjusted with conditions of the latest vehicle state. Each vehicle in this study is deemed as an agent, under which a novel control strategy is developed for these autonomous agents with deception attacks. With the assistance of Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the stability and stabilization of the overall system. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.

More precisely, the memory information for information exchanges of autonomous underwater vehicles is utilized such that the synchronization performance can be improved. By employing the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method with model transformation, sufficient criteria are established for guaranteeing the synchronization, and the corresponding distributed synchronization controllers are designed based on matrix techniques. Finally, the effectiveness and benefits of our theoretical method are supported by an illustrative example with simulation results.

ID CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; FUTURE; POLICY
AB This paper simulates land use changes at a point in time when autonomous vehicles are widespread. If autonomous vehicles become the main means of transportation in the future, people can pass their time on the road by reading, eating, and interacting with friends. People will no longer have the burden of having to drive, and this will change people's perception of travel time. In addition, this will have an impact on people's choice of residence. Previous studies have already argued that if autonomous vehicles become commonplace, the city will become suburbanized. However, previous studies have not presented specific models or figures about such future cities. Therefore, this paper seeks to suggest specific models of land use change when autonomous vehicles are dominant through the cellular automata method. For land use, residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, social, public, and green areas are considered, and accessibility, land price, accessibility to green spaces, and neighborhood effects are selected as land use change factors. Simulations based on the scenarios presented in this paper by Heinrichs show two representative results. First, most agricultural areas will decrease, and residential and commercial areas in Gyeonggi province will expand. Second, most land usage will change to residential land use, and only the central commercial area in Seoul will remain. This result can serve as a guideline for urban planning when autonomous vehicles become the main means of transportation. Furthermore, this paper could be helpful for the development of regulations and policy enforcement around autonomous vehicles.

We show how neural networks can be advantageously used for the nonlinear modeling of such mobile robots, taking available a priori knowledge into account. The efficiency of neural networks for non linear optimal control is demonstrated on the lateral control of the vehicle; their ability to implement robust control laws, needed on rough terrain, is illustrated with the velocity control system of the vehicle, which makes use of an infernal model of the vehicle.

The actuator dead-zone phenomenon, which is a common non-smooth property caused by the complicated operating environment of autonomous marine vehicles, is also considered. To cope with the issue of "complexity explosion" and further decrease the tracking errors, a command filtering compensation strategy is also proposed, which guarantees satisfactory tracking performance and boundedness of the closed-loop system signals. Finally, simulation studies are given to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.

AB Motion sickness comprises a set of symptoms, such as nausea, headaches, and disorientation, that affects healthy individuals when undergoing different types of motion, including virtual motion. The ways of mitigating motion sickness is a controversial issue as it strongly depends on variability among individuals due to anthropometric, physical as well as physiological traits, making it difficult to identify and derive a universal solution. With the introduction of autonomous vehicles, we are moving from car sickness, which is motion sickness induced when riding in cars, to autonomous car sickness, which arises from riding in autonomous vehicles. To ensure advancement of fully-autonomous vehicles, a comfortable experience must be provided to the passengers. An important factor that affects the acceptance of autonomous cars is the capability of passengers to perform non-driving tasks like reading, relaxing, and/or socialising in a comfortable style with no or limited motion sickness symptoms. Drivers, who never suffer from motion sickness while driving, might be, when riding as passengers in autonomous cars, susceptible to motion sickness due to the lack of controllability on the vehicle in addition to sensory conflicts. Therefore, in-depth investigations on the causes of autonomous car sickness are required. In this paper, we present different theories explaining the 'how' and 'why' of motion sickness and then discuss whether these factors are applicable to autonomous car sickness. The adaptation of different motion sickness predictors that can be used to limit autonomous car sickness are also discussed, with a proposal of a framework that provides a viable solution to mitigate autonomous carsickness.

AB With the fast development, Internet technology has become a game-changer to the automotive industry. The advances and general applications of high-precision maps make it possible for accurate real-time positioning of vehicles. Meanwhile, the extensive applications of intelligent driving technology make it easier and more intelligent to drive vehicles. This paper reviewed the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of autonomous driving comprehensively and explored the innovative studies of other unmanned motion systems at the same time. Firstly, the hardware architecture of the autonomous driving system is introduced, including five modules as follows: sensing, autonomous driving computer, power supply, signal communication, execution and braking. In addition, General Motors autonomous vehicle is used as an example to introduce its differences from the traditional vehicles in the hardware part. Subsequently, the autonomous driving software is divided into four modules according to functions: positioning, sensing, planning, and control, and the innovative application of artificial intelligence algorithms is introduced. Finally, this paper expands from autonomous driving technology and puts forward an innovative research idea for the intelligent unmanned system.

Long distance autonomous drive has been achieved; however the results haven't met the expectations of the project requirements. In order to provide these requirements, this study is conducted. In this study, long distance autonomous trajectory tracking for an orchard vehicle is studied. Besides longitudinal motion, lateral motion of the vehicle is also considered. The longitudinal and lateral errors are objected to keep into a region of less than 10 cm.
   Design/methodology/approach - Car-like robot kinematic modeling approach is used to create desired trajectory. In order to control longitudinal velocity and steering angle of the vehicle, a controller methodology is proposed. Stability of the controller proposed is shown by using Lyapunov stability approach.
   Findings - The proposed model is adapted into a four-wheeled autonomous orchard vehicle and tested in an experimental orchard for long distance autonomous drives. More than 15 km autonomous drive is successfully achieved and the details are presented in this paper.
   Originality/value - In this study, long distance autonomous trajectory tracking for an orchard vehicle is focused. A model based control strategy, including the information about longitudinal and lateral motion of the vehicle, is constructed. A new approach to create steering angles for turning operations of the orchard vehicle is introduced. It is objected that the longitudinal and lateral errors should be less than 10 cm during the trajectory tracking task.

AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) can detect pedestrians with high accuracy by utilising various sensors. Although it is an undesirable condition, traffic crashes can occur if any sensor misfunctions. This paper focuses to measure the severity of pedestrian injury during autonomous bus-pedestrian crashes via finite element simulation as pedestrians are very vulnerable in traffic crashes. Two types of vehicle impact were considered (frontal and side), and risk injury in head and chest region were evaluated. Effect of vehicle velocity (ranging from 5-10 m/s) on risk probability were evaluated. It was found that higher velocity caused more damage to pedestrian body, and frontal impact was more severe than the side impact. Maximum values of head-injury-criteria and chest acceleration were 248 and 36 g, respectively, when vehicle speed was 10 m/s. AV developers can use these results to implement a safer AV design and reduce pedestrian risk injury.

AB With the development of the connected autonomous bus, the interactions between the bus and social vehicle during the mandatory lane changing for bus exiting become more diverse and complex. This research investigates the evolutionary dynamics of behavioral decision-making for the bus and social vehicle in different scenarios. The evolutionary game model for the connected autonomous bus and social vehicle is built, as do the human-driven bus and social vehicle, and the connected autonomous bus under different penetration rates and social vehicle. The results of numerical experiments reveal that the connected autonomous bus chooses to change lanes in most instances, and the strategies of the human-driven bus show conservative tendencies. Such tendencies are weakened when the connected autonomous bus and human-driven bus are mixed. As for the social vehicle in different scenarios, the strategies that balance overall traffic safety and efficiency are promoted. This research provides some references for intelligent decision-making of lane changing in urban public transportation.

AB Previous research into perceptions of autonomous vehicles has largely focused on a priori attitudes, with little work on the perception of specific traffic situations, context and driving styles. The present study used three simulator experiments (total N = 150) to examine the combined effects of vehicle speed, lane position, information presentation and traffic context on occupants' levels of satisfaction with autonomous highway journeys. Overall, occupants preferred being in a vehicle that was mostly overtaking compared to being overtaken, regardless of whether the overtaking vehicles were exceeding the speed limit. This finding remained even when occupants were given additional reminders that they themselves were travelling at an appropriate speed (Experiments 1 & 2). Experiment 3 found that occupants preferred overtaking to being overtaken when following another car, but this preference disappeared when they were following a lorry, suggesting that occupants' sensitivity to position amongst the traffic was partially context dependent. Overall, the findings suggest that journey satisfaction is sensitive to overtaking contexts and the inappropriate behaviour of other drivers (e.g., speeding) can reduce journey satisfaction for occupants in autonomous vehicles that drive within the speed limit, depending on the specific traffic situation. Potential implications for the integration of autonomous vehicles with other traffic and the need for in-vehicle presentation of information are discussed.

AB Although autonomous vehicle (AV) technology is expected to bring dramatic societal, environmental, and economic benefits, the high vehicle cost might slow the adoption of AVs. This paper explores an infrastructure-enabled autonomous driving system, which is a promising remedy to the high cost of AVs. Specifically, the system combines vehicles and infrastructure in the realization of autonomous driving. Equipped with roadside sensing, computing, and communicating devices, an ordinary road can be upgraded into an "automated road" enabling autonomous driving service for vehicles with the minimum required on-board devices. The vehicle costs can thus be significantly reduced. We envision that automated roads will be deployed in transportation networks to serve a new type of vehicle called infrastructure-enabled autonomous vehicles (IEAVs), which can be driven autonomously only on automated roads but manually on ordinary roads. Therefore, IEAV users may experience inconvenience costs due to transitions between autonomous driving and manual driving, and the frequent switch will inevitably yield high inconvenience costs. Therefore, to minimize their individual travel cost, they have to decide whether to switch to the autonomous driving mode when heading to an automated road. Considering such a unique feature of IEAVs, we proposed a group of driving-mode-choice equilibrium conditions to describe IEAV drivers' driving mode choice behaviors, in which we considered drivers' travel time costs, service charges of autonomous driving, and inconvenience costs due to driving mode change. Combining traditional route-choice equilibrium conditions with the proposed drivingmode-choice equilibrium conditions, we developed a new user equilibrium (UE) model to describe the equilibrium flow distributions in a road network with automated roads and mixedautonomy traffic. The UE model is formulated as a novel non-linear complementarity problem, and its solution existence is discussed. To solve the UE model, a network expansion method is proposed to reformulate the UE model as a standard path-based UE model. A route-swappingbased solution algorithm is then used to solve the reformulated UE model. Numerical studies are presented to demonstrate the proposed models and algorithms.

AB Autonomous vehicles are part of an expanding industry that encompasses various interdisciplinary fields such as dynamic controls, thermal engineering, sensors, data processing, and artificial intelligence. Exposure to extreme environmental conditions, such as changes to temperature and humidity, affects sensor performance. To address potential safety concerns related to sensor perception used in autonomous vehicles in extremely cold real-world situations, specifically Alaska, examination of frosts and water droplets impact on vehicle optical sensors is conducted in both real-world and laboratory-controlled settings. Machine learning models are utilized to determine the vision impediment levels. Potential hardware and software tools are then introduced as solutions for the environmental impacts. Through this research, a better understanding of the potential caveats and algorithm solutions can be suggested to improve autonomous driving, even under challenging weather conditions.

AB The article examines a 'trinity' of interconnected components by Mobileye, a company moving into autonomous driving. However, Mobileye is neither an automotive manufacturer, nor a nominal 'big tech' company, but an established maker of 'bolt-on' advanced driver assist systems (ADAS), able to draw on over 65 million vehicles. Through these devices, Mobileye is undertaking a 'platformisation', transforming from an automotive supplier into a provider of autonomous vehicle (AV) platforms. We characterise this as a 'car-agnostic' approach to autonomous driving. Mobileye represents the advancement, and modulation, of a platform logic into a different type of hardware: the car. To understand the implications of this, we argue that Mobileye acts parasitically in three ways: by inserting itself between driver and vehicle, vehicle manufacturer and vehicle data, and specific vehicles and the emerging AV industry.

AB Compared with traditional rule-based algorithms, deep reinforcement learning methods in autonomous driving are able to reduce the response time of vehicles to the driving environment and fully exploit the advantages of autopilot. Nowadays, autonomous vehicles mainly drive on urban roads and are constrained by some map elements such as lane boundaries, lane driving rules, and lane center lines. In this paper, a deep reinforcement learning approach seriously considering map elements is proposed to deal with the autonomous driving issues of vehicles following and obstacle avoidance. When the deep reinforcement learning method is modeled, an obstacle representation method is proposed to represent the external obstacle information required by the ego vehicle input, aiming to address the problem that the number and state of external obstacles are not fixed.

AB The foreseeable large-scale deployment of autonomous vehicles in the near future raises the question of autonomous intersection management (AIM). Numerous AIM designs have been proposed, but they lack a common vision of what defines a good system. In this study, the authors discuss a set of conflicting evaluation criteria that need to be balanced in the design of an AIM system, but are often considered individually in the literature. They then introduce their own priority-based design, where an intersection controller assigns priorities to incoming vehicles. On being assigned a priority, vehicles then cross the intersection while maintaining a so-called brake-safe state with respect to higher priority vehicles, rendering the system robust. They have performed extensive simulations to showcase the properties of the proposed system, and notably that it satisfactorily balances their criteria while remaining efficient.

AB A novel platoon control algorithm for autonomous vehicles is proposed in this paper. There is an interaction between adjacent vehicles. In order to describe this interaction, a nonlin-ear function is designed. Then a non-linear distributed event-triggered controller with time delay is designed for the two cases of communication delay. In order to save resources fur-therly, we have designed an event-triggered control strategy. In addition, the consensus of autonomous vehicles is guaranteed. Combining with Lyapunov's theory, we derive the up-per bound of time delay of vehicle platoon. Finally, we give two simulation examples to verify the feasibility and accuracy of the method.

AB Accurately identifying the driving threat could greatly improve the driving safety for autonomous vehicles in the mixed traffic, where the human-driven and driverless, as well as different types of vehicles coexist. The existing safety evaluation methods merely focus on the possibility of collision, which is deficient to evaluate the hazard level due to the symmetry for both the interactive vehicles. Thus, the vehicle aggressiveness model is proposed in this paper based on the asymmetric interactions between different types of vehicles from the perspective of the social cognitions in the human driving. Firstly, a new conceptual framework of the vehicle aggressiveness is constructed, and the factors are analyzed. Secondly, the general mathematic formulation of the aggressiveness is deduced elaborately based on the analogy with the mechanical wave. Thirdly, the simplified formulation is derived by introducing resonant assumption, and an illustration of aggressiveness distribution is presented and discussed. The mathematical analysis and simulation results indicate that the proposed model could explicitly describe the asymmetric characteristics as regards the vehicle mass, motion states and position. Finally, the potential applications in safety assessment, decision-making and motion planning of the social cognitive autonomous driving are discussed. The aggressiveness model provides a new perspective in asymmetric driving safety evaluation and heterogeneous driving behavior model under complex and mixed traffic environments.

AB Surrogate safety measures (SSMs) are critical tools for evaluating the safety performance of mixed traffic. Crashes are rare events, and historical crash data are scarce for mixed traffic that includes autonomous and/ or connected vehicles. Recent safety review papers focus on traditional human-driven vehicles (TVs) and do not encompass advanced technology vehicles such as autonomous vehicles (AVs), connected vehicles (CVs), and connected-autonomous vehicles (CAVs). This study examines the development, implementation, and shortcomings of SSMs and SSM-based models used for mixed traffic safety evaluation. We review the current relevant literature and apply a case study analysis using a real-world mixed traffic dataset. The study summarizes the fundamental SSM guiding concepts, as well as their most significant metrics including threshold values employed in the past for SSMs and SSM-based models. Primary benefits and limitations of examined SSMs and SSM-based models are also underlined. This review reveals significant gaps in the literature that might guide future research paths in SSM-based mixed traffic safety assessment. Critical gaps include the absence of robust SSM threshold selection criteria, the suitability of current SSMs in mixed traffic research, microsimulation modeling that lacks proper calibration and validation, and the absence of a framework for selecting or combining multiple SSMs.

AB The tracking accuracy of speed plays a significant role in the autonomous vehicle's control and safety management. In this study, we presented a novel method called self-adaptive proportional integral derivative (PID) of radial basis function neural network (RBFNN-PID) which is shown with improved longitudinal speed tracking accuracy for autonomous vehicles. A forward simulation model of longitudinal speed control for autonomous vehicles is established based on the driver model of self-adaptive RBFNN-PID and the vehicle dynamics model. Based on that, we used the traditional PID and fuzzy control methods as benchmarks to demonstrate the edge of the self-adaptive RBFNN-PID control under the new European driving cycle. Simulation results show the RBFNN-PID method is significantly more precise than the comparing groups, with a reduced error in the range of [-0.369, 0.203]m/s. The vehicle performance gives better ride comfort as well. In all, self-adaptive RBFNN-PID is proven to be effective in longitudinal speed control of autonomous vehicles and significantly outperforms the other two methods.

AB This article introduces a new technique for stabilizing autonomous underwater vehicles in the descriptor model. Autonomous underwater vehicle stabilization is limited by several constraints, including time-variable uncertainty, time delay, and disturbances. The interaction of descriptor system requirements and the issues mentioned above adds complexities. This study outlines the delay-dependent H-infinity robust stability achieved through memory-less and memory state feedback. Furthermore, a less conservative sufficient condition is obtained for admissibility using a new delay-dependent linear matrices inequality. Autonomous underwater vehicle is regular, impulse-free, and stable under all permissible conditions and satisfies prescribed H-infinity performance conditions via a Lyapunov functional approach. The method applies to neutral and retarded dynamics with discrete and distributed time delays.

AB The proliferation of autonomous systems like unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous vehicles and AI-powered industrial and social robots can benefit society significantly, but these systems also present significant governance challenges in operational, legal, economic, social, and ethical dimensions. Singapore's role as a front-runner in the trial of autonomous systems presents an insightful case to study whether the current provisional regulations address the challenges. With multiple stakeholder involvement in setting provisional regulations, government stewardship is essential for coordinating robust regulation and helping to address complex issues such as ethical dilemmas and social connectedness in governing autonomous systems.

AB Recently, large amounts of data traffic from various sensors and image and navigation systems within vehicles are generated for autonomous driving. Broadband communication networks within vehicles have become necessary. New autonomous Ethernet networks are being considered as alternatives. The Ethernet-based in-vehicle network has been standardized in the IEEE 802.1 time-sensitive network (TSN) group since 2006. The Ethernet TSN will be revised and integrated into a subsequent version of IEEE 802.1Q-2018 published in 2018 when various new TSN-related standards are being newly revised and published. A TSN integrated environment simulator is developed in this paper to implement the main functions of the TSN standards that are being developed. This effort would minimize the performance gaps that can occur when the functions of these standards operate in an integrated environment. As part of this purpose, we analyzed the simulator to verify that the traffic for autonomous driving satisfies the TSN transmission requirements in the in-vehicle network (IVN) and the preemption (which is one of the main TSN functions) and reduces the overall End-to-End delay. An optimal guard band size for the preemption was also found for autonomous vehicles in our work. Finally, an IVN model for autonomous vehicles was designed and the performance test was conducted by configuring the traffic to be used for various sensors and electronic control units (ECUs).

AB Autonomous surface vehicles are gaining increasing attention worldwide due to the potential benefits of improving safety and efficiency. This has raised the interest in developing methods for path planning that can reduce the risk of collisions, groundings, and stranding accidents at sea, as well as costs and time expenditure. In this paper, we review guidance, and more specifically, path planning algorithms of autonomous surface vehicles and their classification. In particular, we highlight vessel autonomy, regulatory framework, guidance, navigation and control components, advances in the industry, and previous reviews in the field. In addition, we analyse the terminology used in the literature and attempt to clarify ambiguities in commonly used terms related to path planning. Finally, we summarise and discuss our findings and highlight the potential need for new regulations for autonomous surface vehicles.

AB Automated driving of vehicles on highways may be accomplished by dividing the control problem in the longitudinal and lateral direction. In this paper the problem of lateral control of vehicles operating in a platoon without the use of road infrastructure, that is autonomous following, is considered. Firstly, the limitations of autonomous following without inter-vehicle communication are uncovered. Specifically, the influence of rear end off-tracking and look-ahead distance on the accuracy of lane following is illustrated. Next, the notion of string stability for a platoon is introduced. It is shown that the interconnected platoon without inter-vehicle communication theoretically can be string stable at the expense of poor performance. Finally, it is shown that, under certain circumstances, the addition of inter-vehicle communication eliminates the interconnection with the rest of the vehicles in the platoon, resulting in accurate lane following. The analytical results are verified by simulations and experiments.

AB With the increasing popularity of autonomous vehicles, it is important to understand their user satisfaction because such aspects are likely to determine their future development. This article studied the effects of perceived benefit, perceived risk, interpersonal feelings, infrastructure adaptability, driving self-efficacy and mental workload on satisfaction when using autonomous vehicles, designed three road scenarios (simple, general, and complex), and established a structural equation model of satisfaction with mediators. A total of 553 responses were retrieved through online questionnaires, the path coefficients among various factors and indicators were calculated, and the importance of each factor in different road scenarios was discussed. The results show that the six factors have different association with user satisfaction in different road scenarios. The effect of mental workload on satisfaction in all road scenarios is mediated by selfefficacy. These results provide insights for the improvement of the autonomous vehicle industry.

AB Understanding of the driving scenario represents a necessary condition for autonomous driving. Within the control routine of an autonomous vehicle, it represents the preliminary step for the motion planning system. Estimation algorithms hence need to handle a considerable number of information coming from multiple sensors, to provide estimates regarding the motion of ego-vehicle and surrounding obstacles. Furthermore, tracking is crucial in obstacles state estimation, because it ensures obstacles recognition during time. This paper presents an integrated algorithm for the estimation of ego-vehicle and obstacles' positioning and motion along a given road, modeled in curvilinear coordinates. Sensor fusion deals with information coming from two Radars and a Lidar to identify and track obstacles. The algorithm has been validated through experimental tests carried on a prototype of an autonomous vehicle. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The crucial dynamic path planning of autonomous vehicles is achieved via obstacle avoidance path planning technology. The reduction of the tire adhesion coefficient on icy and snowy roads (ISRs) increases the difficulty of autonomous vehicles' control. In this paper, the driving characteristics of vehicles on ISRs are established, and the artificial potential field function is introduced to avoid collision risk when planning a path. A dynamic path planning algorithm for autonomous vehicles based on the artificial potential field (APF) is established. The adjustment factor is added to the gravitational potential field, and a judgment coefficient is added to the repulsive potential field to improve the artificial potential field function, based on the low adhesion of vehicles on ISRs. Moreover, a path with a continuous curvature is generated to achieve the driving comfort and driving safety of the planned path via trajectory smoothing. By establishing the Carsim/Simulink co-simulation platform, the effectiveness of dynamic path planning for autonomous vehicles under different algorithms and different obstacle models is compared. The results show that the improved APF algorithm has an obvious effect on the smoothness of the path and the reduction of the curvature mutation and can generate a safe and efficient path on icy and snowy roads. The dynamic obstacle avoidance of the improved APF algorithm improves the pre-judgment accuracy of the collision risk assessment of autonomous vehicles and shows the superiority of the improved algorithm.

DE Autonomous vehicle; Automation-to-manual handoff; Driving simulator
AB In autonomous vehicle operation, situations may arise when the driver is required to re-engage in manual control of the vehicle. Whether the control handoff from vehicle to human is done in a structured or unstructured manner, the process may be affected by the driver's state, i.e. distracted or not. The study reported here was designed to measure a non-distracted driver's response to a sudden forward collision (FC) event, in which the driver would assume manual control of the autonomous vehicle. Three driving scenarios were investigated: autonomous vehicle driven with full collision avoidance Support, autonomous vehicle driven without collision avoidance support, and vehicle driven in manual mode.
   Forty-eight volunteers participated in a simulator study conducted in VIRTEX. It was found that, at handoff, (1) drivers in manual mode tended to use evasive steering, rather than braking, compared to drivers in both the autonomous modes, (2) between subjects variations in speed were higher for the automation with collision support condition than for the other two scenarios, (3) for both autonomous driving scenarios, drivers reaction times were longer than for manual driving. In some cases the driver response was so late and the distance remaining so reduced that crash avoidance might be unfeasible. At a minimum, results of this study suggest that drivers may benefit from appropriate driver assistance technologies when a crash imminent situation is suddenly encountered. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Over the last decade, researchers and the car industry became very active in the deployment of driverless cars as they can greatly increase safety of the vehicle, rate of traffic accidents, as well as the effect of climate on automobiles. The structural design of the autonomous vehicle system has been very important for the advancement of automated driving. A strong design will boost autonomous vehicle's 'safety and handling'. Overall, technology of autonomous vehicle systems is similar, but self-driving vehicles differ considerably in expertise. The key explanation is the automated driving technology architecture. In implementing automated driving, software architecture plays a crucial function. The ability of driverless vehicles to work in real-world situations in a healthy and stable manner is currently being studied in public roads. However, they are restricted to specific traffic conditions and incidents. This paper therefore discusses the key technologies and embedded system essentials required to understand the system architecture of these applications. A comparison has been drawn for sensing devices which necessitates the requirement of sensor fusion for correct functioning of the autonomous vehicles. Timeline of autonomous vehicles from 1925 to 2021 has been shown and then discussed. A detailed interpretation of the capabilities and weaknesses of different sensor systems is provided by this comparative analysis of the perception systems used in fully automated vehicles. In addition to providing insight into the possibilities for improvements, it also indicates possible areas for additional research and analyses the accuracy, dependability, and cost of the various technologies. The analysis also gives a summary of the present situation of the autonomous vehicle perception systems and analyses for advancements in the future. By increasing knowledge of the various sensing technologies utilized in these cars, comparative analysis of perception systems used in fully automated vehicles can be helpful in closing the gap in the literature and/or practices currently in use.

AB The unmanned surface vessel (USV) and the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) have become important means of ocean observation. In this paper, we have combined the characteristics of USV and AUV to design a hybrid energy positive buoyancy autonomous vehicle that satisfies requirements for water surface and underwater operations. The vehicle maintains positive buoyancy and underwater motion is achieved through thruster propulsion, inverted V rudder adjustment attitude, and using the lift generated by its wing to counteract the buoyancy force. Therefore, the vehicle does not need to carry a complicated variable buoyancy device, and the space saved can carry more energy or payload. The hybrid energy technology of solar batteries and lithium batteries will also be used to improve the endurance of the positive buoyancy autonomous vehicle. The main contributions of this article are new solutions to the challenges of combined water surface and underwater motions, the optimization design of the vehicle, the development of the required control algorithms, and the demonstration of the vehicle successfully surface sailing, entering, diving, underwater sailing, and exiting the water. The results of the lake test demonstrate that the positive buoyancy autonomous vehicle has desired motion performance, high safety, and strong adaptability to the environment.

AB In this paper, the car-following control problem of nonholonomic autonomous electric vehicles in the curved highway is studied. Owing to the fact that the nonholonomic autonomous electric vehicles have the features of strong coupling, parametric uncertainties, nonlinearities and external disturbances, a novel integrated adaptive car-following control system is constructed to supervise the longitudinal and lateral motions of vehicles. Firstly, an adaptive fuzzy dynamic surface car-following control strategy is presented to determine a vector of total forces and torque of autonomous electric vehicles, which can guarantee the uniform ultimate boundedness of close-loop control signals. Then, an optimal tire forces distribution law is proposed to dynamically allocate the desired coupled tire longitudinal and lateral forces in real-time. Finally, simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed car-following control approach.

AB In this paper, a new approach for the implementation of autonomous driving of a ground vehicle on narrow and high-curvature roads using a surround view system is proposed. The approach called the independent frame consecutive searching technique is an algorithm which is developed to detect the left and right lane markers of a lane stably and to generate virtual lane marker lines especially when the roads are narrow and have sudden corners and windings with some faded lane markers. Then the steering angle of an autonomous vehicle is calculated so that the vehicle drives along the desired path after deriving the smoothed virtual centerline. In the real-time experiment, the suggested approach achieved robust detection of lane markers using surround view images and drove a test vehicle autonomously with the generated desired paths on such narrow and high-curvature roads with any lane departures. Therefore, this study shows that the method can be applied to the development of autonomous vehicles.

AB The rapid development of 5G and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has promoted the widespread application of autonomous driving in various scenarios. Currently, autonomous vehicles (AVs) can autonomously perform operations such as turning, lane changing, and acceleration in accordance with road traffic rules. It is a challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to plan a series of safe and efficient trajectories on ice and snow covered road (ISCR). This paper proposes an optimal trajectory planning algorithm based on the Frenet coordinate system, which ignores the influence of road curvature and improves the quality of trajectory. Specifically, the vehicle motion is decoupled into two dimensions using the Frenet coordinate system to build lateral and longitudinal trajectory planning models, respectively. Further, according to the information on the initial and target configuration, the corresponding trajectory sets of lateral and longitudinal motion were generated by sampling. Moreover, to improve the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on ice and snow covered road (ISCR), the cost of driving distance and ice-obstacle distance is used as the core indicator to evaluate the trajectory planning cost, combined with the safe speed check. Simulation results show that this algorithm can plan an optimal trajectory for autonomous vehicles (AVs) that combines safety, comfort, and stability, especially on ice and snow covered road (ISCR).

AB Unmanned maritime systems are evolving in a rapidly changing environment. Although the regulation and international law processes are still in progress, there are numerous research attempts regarding autonomous maritime vehicle path planning particularly. In contrast to ground and air autonomous path planning, ship path planning has numerous pitfalls such as safety, complexity and environmental dynamics that hinder the emergence of reliable autonomous systems. This review explores the path planning algorithms of autonomous maritime vehicles and their collision regulation relevance in order to reveal how the research community handles this issue. Our relevant findings point out that there are still many traffic rules to be dealt by path planning algorithms. Algorithms that can be calibrated in terms of safe distance, safe speed and etc. may be deemed more compliant after regulation amendments.

AB The autonomous vehicle is a mobile robot integrating multi-sensor navigation and positioning, intelligent decision making and control technology. This paper presents the control system architecture of the autonomous vehicle, called "Intelligent Pioneer", and the path tracking and stability of motion to effectively navigate in unknown environments is discussed. In this approach, a two degree-of-freedom dynamic model is developed to formulate the path-tracking problem in state space format. For controlling the instantaneous path error, traditional controllers have difficulty in guaranteeing performance and stability over a wide range of parameter changes and disturbances. Therefore, a newly developed adaptive-PID controller will be used. By using this approach the flexibility of the vehicle control system will be increased and achieving great advantages. Throughout, we provide examples and results from Intelligent Pioneer and the autonomous vehicle using this approach competed in the 2010 and 2011 Future Challenge of China. Intelligent Pioneer finished all of the competition programmes and won first position in 2010 and third position in 2011.

AB One of the unique global behaviours of a group of under-actuated autonomous vehicles is known as cyclic pursue, which requires a group of vehicles to uniformly distribute on circles and at the same time, to orbit around a centre point, while circumnavigation further requires those vehicles to circumnavigate a predefined target of interest. Such behaviours can also be called periodic formations. This paper further studies the periodic formations for multi-agent systems composed of a group of under-actuated autonomous vehicles and a target of interest by proposing a distributed strategy to maintain any required distance between two vehicles and desired angle difference between vehicle's heading and the line of sight that takes directly towards its pursuing vehicle. The authors' distributed control law, dependent only on the information of its pursuing vehicle and itself, can not only enable a network of autonomous vehicles to circulate around a target of interest, but also achieve any physically feasible periodic formations, which include forming regular polygons as a special case.

AB The study of vehicular networks has attracted considerable interest in academia and the industry. In the broad area, connected vehicles and autonomous driving are technologies based on wireless data communication between vehicles or between vehicles and infrastructures. A Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) system consists of communications and computing over vehicles and related infrastructures. In such a system, wireless sensors are installed in some selected points along roads or driving areas. In autonomous driving, it is crucial for a vehicle to figure out the ideal routes by the communications between its equipped sensors and infrastructures then the vehicle is automatically moving along the routes. In this paper, we propose a Bezier curve based recursive algorithm, which effectively creates routes for vehicles through the communication between the On-Board Unit (OBU) and the Road-Side Units (RSUs). In addition, this approach generates a very low overhead. We conduct simulations to test the proposed algorithm in various situations. The experiment results demonstrate that our algorithm creates almost ideal routes.

AB This work reconsiders the concept of community-based trip sharing proposed by Hasan et al. (2018) that leverages the structure of commuting patterns and urban communities to optimize trip sharing. It aims at quantifying the benefits of autonomous vehicles for community-based trip sharing, compared to a car-pooling platform where vehicles are driven by their owners. In the considered problem, each rider specifies a desired arrival time for her inbound trip (commuting to work) and a departure time for her outbound trip (commuting back home). In addition, her commute time cannot deviate too much from the duration of a direct trip. Prior work motivated by reducing parking pressure and congestion in the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan, showed that a car-pooling platform for community-based trip sharing could reduce the number of vehicles by close to 60%.
   This paper studies the potential benefits of autonomous vehicles in further reducing the number of vehicles needed to serve all these commuting trips. It proposes a column-generation procedure that generates and assembles mini routes to serve inbound and outbound trips, using a lexicographic objective that first minimizes the required vehicle count and then the total travel distance. The optimization algorithm is evaluated on a large-scale, real-world dataset of commute trips from the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan. The results of the optimization show that it can leverage autonomous vehicles to reduce the daily vehicle usage by 92%, improving upon the results of the original Commute Trip Sharing Problem by 34%, while also reducing daily vehicle miles traveled by approximately 30%. These results demonstrate the significant potential of autonomous vehicles for the shared commuting of a community to a common work destination.

AB Artificial intelligence- (AI-) empowered machines are devised to mimic human actions. In the automotive industry, AI plays a significant role in the development of vehicular technology. AI joins hands with the field of mechatronics to assist in the accurate execution of the vehicle functionalities. Autonomous vehicles get the scene information by using onboard sensors such as laser, radar, lidar, Global Positioning System (GPS), and vehicular communication networks. The data obtained is then used for various path planning and control techniques to make the vehicles capable of autonomously driving in complex environments. Autonomous vehicles use very up-to-date AI algorithms to localize themselves in known and unknown environments. AI algorithms are also exploited for perception, path planning, and motion control. A concise review of the state-of-the-art techniques to improve the performance of autonomous vehicles is presented.

Such feature will provide better and safe maneuvering for autonomous vehicle. The proposed control scheme consists of Asymmetric Barrier Lyapunov Function (ABLF) based backstepping method for ensuring stability and constraints satisfaction. Since autonomous vehicle dynamics is subjected to unknown disturbances and also the states, it has been shown that the vehicle performance can be improved by the application of Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) which uses the Extended State Observer (ESO). For the proposed control scheme, the asymptotic stability and convergence of error dynamics have been established. The simulation results have been presented to illustrate the performance robustness and accuracy provided by the proposed control scheme. Further, it has been show that the vehicle motion performance is better in comparison to the performances obtained from two existing control methods.

AB Autonomous driving is one of the most important AI applications and has attracted extensive interest in recent years. A large number of studies have successfully applied reinforcement learning techniques in various aspects of autonomous driving, ranging from low-level control of driving maneuvers to higher level of strategic decision-making. However, comparatively less progress has been made in investigating how co-existing autonomous vehicles would interact with each other in a common environment and how reinforcement learning can be helpful in such situations by applying multiagent reinforcement learning techniques in the high-level strategic decision-making of the following or overtaking for a group of autonomous vehicles in highway scenarios. Learning to achieve coordination among vehicles in such situations is challenging due to the unique feature of vehicular mobility, which renders it infeasible to directly apply the existing coordinated learning approaches. To solve this problem, we propose using dynamic coordination graph to model the continuously changing topology during vehicles' interactions and come up with two basic learning approaches to coordinate the driving maneuvers for a group of vehicles. Several extension mechanisms are then presented to make these approaches workable in a more complex and realistic setting with any number of vehicles. The experimental evaluation has verified the benefits of the proposed coordinated learning approaches, compared with other approaches that learn without coordination or rely on some traditional mobility models based on some expert driving rules.

AB Autonomous driving hybrid electric vehicles can offer unprecedented opportunities for autonomous safe & energy-efficient driving. However, how to integrate energy optimization during the car-following process and vehicle safety under complex traffic flow is a formidable challenge. Moreover, the coordinated control of three chassis parts including electric motor, internal combustion engine and vehicle brake system is hard to be tackled. Therefore, this paper aims to address longitudinal autonomous driving for intelligent hybrid electric vehicles. A game-theory-based longitudinal autonomous driving control framework is proposed with much easier access to information due to vehicle-to-vehicle/vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, which is our main contribution. Firstly, the whole longitudinal driving control is transformed into a multi-objective optimal problem, which contains safety, economy, comfort, so a game theory model is built to solve the multi-objective equilibrium problem. Then, to obtain the closed-loop strategies in Nash differential game, a system of coupled algebraic Riccati equations is solved. Finally, the game-theory-based control strategies coordinate electric motor, internal combustion engine and vehicle brake system to achieve multi-objective equilibrium. Simulation tests of the proposed framework and previous existing work are carried out, and their results show the proposed framework's better performance of longitudinal dynamics control including car-following, reducing fuel consumption, and driving comfort.

AB With the increasing number of vehicles, driving environment is becoming increasingly complex and dynamic, which makes the driving of autonomous vehicle more difficult. In order to improve the safety of vehicle autonomous driving, in this paper, an improved artificial potential field (APF) path-planning algorithm for complex traffic environment with various obstacles is proposed. Considering the influence of vehicle physical characteristics on obstacle avoidance path, the repulsive potential field function of APF is improved. Then, aiming at the problem that traditional APF algorithm is easily fell into local extremum, a bug algorithm is introduced to ensure global performance of the proposed algorithm. Finally, feasibility and robustness of the proposed hybrid planning algorithm are validated by conducting several simulation investigations in a typical scenario.

AB This paper presents a real-time dynamic path planning method for autonomous driving to avoid collision with crossing pedestrian on branch streets. The velocity obstacle algorithms are introduced to pick up the collision-free velocities for vehicles. In this method, the curvilinear lane edges are considered as static obstacle while crossing pedestrians and approaching vehicles are considered as velocity obstacles. The paths planning of vehicles are optimized by considering the delay minimum and comfort of drivers under the constraints of appropriate parameters for veer, throttle, or brake systems. A single vehicle's path planning and multi-vehicles 'coordinated or uncoordinated paths planning with crossing pedestrian collision avoidance are experimentally simulated including the longitudinal and lateral motions planning of vehicles. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and indicate its wide practical application on autonomous driving to improve the traffic safety of branch streets.

AB We suggest secure Vehicle-to-Vehicle communications in a secure cluster. Here, the security cluster refers to a group of vehicles having a certain level or more of secrecy capacity. Usually, there are many difficulties in defining secrecy capacity, but we define vehicular secrecy capacity for the vehicle defined only by SNR values. Defined vehicular secrecy capacity is practical and efficient in achieving physical layer security in V2V. Typically, secrecy capacity may be changed by antenna related parameters, path related parameters, and noise related parameters. In addition to these conventional parameters, we address unique vehicle-related parameters, such as vehicle speed, safety distance, speed limit, response time, etc. in connection with autonomous driving. We confirm the relationship between vehicle-related secrecy parameters and secrecy capacity through modeling in highway and urban traffic situations. These vehicular secrecy parameters enable real-time control of vehicle secrecy capacity of V2V communications. We can use vehicular secrecy capacity to achieve secure vehicle communications from attackers such as quantum computers. Our research enables economic, effective and efficient physical layer security in autonomous driving.

AB In the transition period, autonomous vehicles are mixed with unconnected traffic occupants, such as non-autonomous vehicles and pedestrians, resulting in a major hurdle toward autonomy in urban areas, especially at intersections. In this context, the cooperative-intelligent transportation system (C-ITS) affords a promising solution to achieve a breakthrough with its omniscient sensors network and computing capability. From the perspective of a C-ITS-based service, the trajectory of non-autonomous vehicle is a critical uncertainty that resides at the intersection. Therefore, this paper proposes a unique interactive framework, which is installed in the edge server of C-ITS and can estimate the present trajectories and predict the future trajectories of the non-autonomous vehicles at intersections. The proposed framework was based on multiple hypotheses of possible maneuvers that formed the confined prior set to reduce the high uncertainties posed by the complicated environment of the urban intersection. The resulting all-in-one framework provided a stable long-term trajectory prediction with intrinsic maneuver classification and improved tracking in an integrated way by incorporating the interactions between the multiple hypotheses. This situation awareness can assist autonomous vehicles to drive safely and defensively. The proposed framework was verified using a dataset collected at a real urban intersection.

AB Autonomous vehicles are expected to completely change the development model of the transportation industry and bring great convenience to our lives. Autonomous vehicles need to constantly obtain the motion status information with on-board sensors in order to formulate reasonable motion control strategies. Therefore, abnormal sensor readings or vehicle sensor failures can cause devastating consequences and can lead to fatal vehicle accidents. Hence, research on the fault tolerant control method is critical for autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we develop a robust fault tolerant path tracking control algorithm through combining the adaptive model predictive control algorithm for lateral path tracking control, improved weight assignment method for multi-sensor data fusion and fault isolation, and novel federal Kalman filtering approach with two states chi-square detector and residual chi-square detector for detection and identification of sensor fault in autonomous vehicles. Our numerical simulation and experiment demonstrate that the developed approach can detect fault signals and identify their sources with high accuracy and sensitivity. In the double line change path tracking control experiment, when the sensors failure occurs, the proposed method shows better robustness and effectiveness than the traditional methods. It is foreseeable that this research will contribute to the development of safer and more intelligent autonomous driving system, which in turn will promote the industrial development of intelligent transportation system.

AB This article focuses on the motion control of autonomous underwater vehicles in the ocean environment by a robust adaptive controller in which there is no regressor matrix. Due to the different atmospheric conditions in the ocean environment, the hydrodynamic coefficients of autonomous underwater vehicles cannot be exactly available and there are many uncertainties in the dynamic model. This prevents the traditional controllers to overcome these difficulties immediately. Hence, developing the adaptive controllers for the autonomous underwater vehicles encountered with uncertainties is required to provide appropriate performance. In the conventional adaptive control system, it is assumed that the autonomous underwater vehicle dynamic model can be linearly written into regressor form. Since the dynamics of the underwater vehicles is very complex, the derivation of the regressor matrix is very tedious. To overcome these problems, a regressor-free adaptive controller is proposed for the autonomous underwater vehicles in the general form of the equations of motion. In this approach, the controller is derived by the inverse dynamic method. Also, by utilizing known basis functions weighted by constant unknown coefficients, the uncertainties of the control law are estimated. The adaptation laws are derived based on Lyapunov stability theorem. The validity of the proposed method is verified by some simulation experiments. The simulation results show that the proposed approach can improve the robustness of adaptive controller to the dynamic model uncertainties and the external disturbance.

AB The design process of an autonomous underwater vehicle requires mathematical model of subsystems or disciplines such as guidance and control, payload, hydrodynamic, propulsion, structure, trajectory and performance and their interactions. In early phases of design, an autonomous underwater vehicle is often encountered with a high degree of uncertainty in the design variables and parameters of system. These uncertainties present challenges to the design process and have a direct effect on the autonomous underwater vehicle performance. Multidisciplinary design optimization is an approach to find both optimum and feasible design, and robust design is an approach to make the system performance insensitive to variations of design variables and parameters. It is significant to integrate the robust design and the multidisciplinary design optimization for designing complex engineering systems in optimal, feasible and robust senses. In this article, we present an improved multidisciplinary design optimization methodology for conceptual design of an autonomous underwater vehicle in both engineering and tactic aspects under uncertainty. In this methodology, uncertain multidisciplinary feasible is introduced as uncertain multidisciplinary design optimization framework. The results of this research illustrate that the new proposed robust multidisciplinary design optimization framework can carefully set a robust design for an autonomous underwater vehicle with coupled uncertain disciplines.

AB Autonomous driving technologies (ADTs) are transformative because they are expected to assume the task of driving. Since travel distance is closely related to the burden of driving, it is expected to affect the ADT preference; however, this effect has not been investigated in the transportation literature. Therefore, this study is designed to investigate the ADT preference and heterogeneity with respect to different travel distances. Hypothetical choice situations were designed to investigate people's ADT preferences over human driving for varying travel distances. Using the stated preference data collected via the experiments, four latent class models were estimated for heterogeneity across classes and travel distances. The estimation results show that three classes, we labeled as competitive, autonomous vehicle oriented, human-driven vehicle oriented, are revealed by the ADT preference, regardless of the travel distance. In addition, in-vehicle activities in hypothetical autonomous driving situations were observed across all the classes and travel distances.

AB The design of the motion of autonomous vehicles in non-signalized intersections with the consideration of multiple criteria and safety constraints is a challenging problem with several tasks. In this paper, a learning-based control solution with guarantees for collision avoidance is proposed. The design problem is formed in a novel way through the division of the control problem, which leads to reduced complexity for achieving real-time computation. First, an environment model for the intersection was created based on a constrained quadratic optimization, with which guarantees on collision avoidance can be provided. A robust cruise controller for the autonomous vehicle was also designed. Second, the environment model was used in the training process, which was based on a reinforcement learning method. The goal of the training was to improve the economy of autonomous vehicles, while guaranteeing collision avoidance. The effectiveness of the method is presented through simulation examples in non-signalized intersection scenarios with varying numbers of vehicles.

AB Introducing an independent four-wheel-steering (4WS) system, we are able to design an autodriver to keep an autonomous vehicle on a given road. The kinematic condition of steering can be used to set the steer angles such that the kinematic center of rotation be at any desired point. The road and tire characteristics, along with the dynamics of a moving vehicle cause the vehicle to turn about an actual point that is not necessarily at the road curvature center. The position of the dynamic turning center can be controlled by adjusting the steer angles such that it coincides with the road curvature center. Such a vehicle will move on the desired road autonomously.

AB We present a bionic neural wave network that uses multiple autonomous underwater vehicles to search and acquire intelligent targets in an unknown underwater environment. The neuron pheromone content is arranged according to neural wave diffusion and layer-by-layer energy attenuation, when underwater mesh space based on neural wave diffusion theory was established that the neuron nodes in the neural network structure correspond to obstacles, autonomous underwater vehicles, and targets in the environment. In order to solve the problems of over-allocation and under-allocation of the multi-autonomous underwater vehicles system during the cooperative capture of targets, a redistribution mechanism based on the improved self-organizing map algorithm is implemented and directed to rationalize task distribution. Two different taboo search methods are employed to update the autonomous underwater vehicle path in real time, and the polynomial coefficient solution method is used to fit partial path data. So that the autonomous underwater vehicle trajectory can be obtained and an interceptor position coordinate can be predicted. An auxiliary autonomous underwater vehicle is aimed to replace the intercepted autonomous underwater vehicle and the matching capture points are tracked to ensure the completion of the task so that the full range of hunting targets is identified. In order to simulate an unknown complex underwater environment, obstacles are randomly arranged around the target, the location information of the obstacle, and the target is unknown and unpredictable. Four simulation experiments were performed to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm under unknown environment. The results show that this algorithm can improve the path update average efficiency by 66% compared with other algorithms. Obviously, this algorithm is reasonable and effective.

AB Challenged by urbanization and increasing travel needs, existing transportation systems need new mobility paradigms. In this article, we present the emerging concept of autonomous mobility-on-demand, whereby centrally orchestrated fleets of autonomous vehicles provide mobility service to customers. We provide a comprehensive review of methods and tools to model and solve problems related to autonomous mobility-on-demand systems. Specifically, we first identify problem settings for their analysis and control, from both operational and planning perspectives. We then review modeling aspects, including transportation networks, transportation demand, congestion, operational constraints, and interactions with existing infrastructure. Thereafter, we provide a systematic analysis of existing solution methods and performance metrics, highlighting trends and trade-offs. Finally, we present various directions for further research.

AB With the continuous development of autonomous driving technology, intelligent vehicles represented by autonomous taxis have begun to participate in the transportation system. Improving the sustainability of intelligent vehicles can increase the useful life of vehicles and reduce the overall increase of vehicles in society. This reduction reduces emissions and energy consumption, thereby increasing environmental sustainability. However, most of the current intelligent vehicles are modified from existing vehicles. The initial design of these vehicle does not consider the requirements for autonomous driving, which can easily lead to a mismatch between the control algorithm and the mechanical structure. Moreover, current intelligent vehicles mainly focus on the development of autonomous driving algorithms and ignore sustainable design, which will lead to increased energy consumption and reduced lifespan. This letter proposes a multi-dimensional circular design (MDCD) framework to improve the sustainability of intelligent vehicles from sustainable lifecycle management perspective. The MDCD framework consists of six parts, which are intelligent design, sensing, control, supervision, diagnosis and recycle. This letter is one of the Distributed/Decentralized Hybrid Workshop on Sustainability for Transportation and Logistics (DHW-STL).

AB Motion planning for autonomous vehicles remains a challenge in urban road environments with occlusions. In this study, we present a motion planning framework that prioritizes safety, comfort, and efficiency to enable autonomous vehicles to navigate safely through urban roads with occlusions. Our solution consists of three main components: local path planning, trajectory planning, and speed planning. First, based on the improved Artificial Potential Field to generate the local path, then the optimal trajectory is solved in the S-L coordinate with the local path as the reference line. Subsequently, the potential risk probability of the occluded area is incorporated into the incomplete information static game framework and implement speed planning based on the game results and the proposed vehicle "safe driving" to complete the collision avoidance between the autonomous vehicle and visible or obscured dynamic traffic participants. In high pedestrian traffic scenarios, simulation verification shows that the proposed model enhances autonomous vehicle comfort levels by about 32% $\sim $ 48% compared to the baseline method utilizing automatic emergency brake system (AEB). We also conducted simulation verification of the proposed model in overtaking and left-turning traffic scenarios, comparing it with other models. The results demonstrate that our proposed model ensures safe autonomous driving in traffic scenario with occlusions while maintaining comfort and efficiency.

ID PATH-TRACKING CONTROL
AB The field of autonomous driving vehicles is growing and expanding rapidly. However, the control systems for autonomous driving vehicles still pose challenges, since vehicle speed and steering angle are always subject to strict constraints in vehicle dynamics. The optimal control action for vehicle speed and steering angular velocity can be obtained from the online objective function, subject to the dynamic constraints of the vehicle's physical limitations, the environmental conditions, and the surrounding obstacles. This paper presents the design of a nonlinear model predictive controller subject to hard and softened constraints. Nonlinear model predictive control subject to softened constraints provides a higher probability of the controller finding the optimal control actions and maintaining system stability. Different parameters of the nonlinear model predictive controller are simulated and analyzed. Results show that nonlinear model predictive control with softened constraints can considerably improve the ability of autonomous driving vehicles to track exactly on different trajectories.

AB We consider a partial differential equation - ordinary differential equation system to describe the dynamics of traffic flow with autonomous vehicles. In the model, the bulk flow of human drivers is represented by a scalar conservation law, while each autonomous vehicle is described by an ordinary differential equation. The coupled PDE-ODE model is introduced, and existence of solutions for this model is shown, along with a proposed algorithm to construct approximate solutions. Next, we propose a control strategy for the speeds of the autonomous vehicles to minimize the average fuel consumption of the entire traffic flow. Existence of solutions for the optimal control problem is proved, and we numerically show that a reduction in average fuel consumption is possible with an AV acting as a moving bottleneck.

ID ENERGY MANAGEMENT
AB Knowledge transfer is a promising concept to achieve real-time decision-making for autonomous vehicles. This paper constructs a transfer deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework to transform the driving tasks in the intersection environments. The driving missions at the unsignalized intersection are cast into a left turn, right turn, and running straight for automated vehicles. The goal of the autonomous ego vehicle (AEV) is to drive through the intersection situation efficiently and safely. This objective promotes the studied vehicle to increase its speed and avoid crashing other vehicles. The decision-making policy learned from one driving task is transferred through three transfer rules in another driving mission and evaluated. Simulation results reveal that the decision-making strategies related to similar tasks are transferable and have a high success rate. It indicates that the presented control framework could reduce time consumption and realize online implementation. Therefore, the transfer RL concept is helpful for establishing the real-time decision-making policy for autonomous vehicles.

AB Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) are gaining increasing importance due to the current needs of modern society for better mobility and societal impact. CAV development and adoption will be driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 5G/6G technologies which will offer increased speed, reduced latency and ubiquity. However, the public is concerned with the concept of handing total control of driving to vehicles. These concerns will inhibit the adoption of CAVs when they become available to the public. In this paper, we investigated user adoption of CAVs by collecting quantitative data from potential users based on their preference and inherent concerns towards adoption. We conducted a statistical analysis and applied machine learning techniques to predict the user adoption for CAVs. Our results show that several machine learning approaches were effective in forecasting user adoption for CAVs. We have employed Neural Networks, Random Forest, Naive Bayes and Fuzzy Logic based models and achieved accuracies of 81.76%, 83.63%, 82.15% and 86.38, respectively, in forecasting the public adoption of CAV.

ID HEAVY VEHICLE; DYNAMICS; MODEL
AB Autonomous trucks are considered as one of the most promising developments for future commercial vehicles. However, the impact of roll dynamics, which is well known as a crucial safety factor for conventional human-driven trucks, is not well studied for the trajectory planning of autonomous trucks. In this study, a trajectory planning strategy of autonomous trucks is proposed for collision avoidance scenarios with rollover prevention. The proposed three-step planning strategy can ensure both vehicle lateral and roll stability and safety, and simultaneously preserve the optimality of the planning solutions in terms of the total traveling time and distance for the whole maneuver. Specifically, the impact of vehicle roll dynamics on the trajectory planning of autonomous trucks is studied. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed trajectory planning strategy are evaluated via co-simulation between Matlab/Simulink and TruckSim.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are quickly becoming part of our transportation systems, and their use is largely dependent on public perceptions. The objective of this study was to evaluate perceptions of CAVs. Specifically, understanding the differences between people who have ridden a CAV in downtown Las Vegas (shuttle-rider survey) versus those who have not (general survey) yet. Two different survey questionnaires were used to collect data that was analyzed by using penalized logistic regression. Results suggest that people who had exposure to CAVs feel more positively about CAVs. Similarly, young, highly educated, males feel more positively about CAVs than their respective counterparts.

AB In this paper, a novel iterative sparse extended information filter (ISEIF) was proposed to solve the simultaneous localization and mapping problem (SLAM), which is very crucial for autonomous vehicles. The proposed algorithm solves the measurement update equations with iterative methods adaptively to reduce linearization errors. With the scalability advantage being kept, the consistency and accuracy of SEIF is improved. Simulations and practical experiments were carried out with both a land car benchmark and an autonomous underwater vehicle. Comparisons between iterative SEIF (ISEIF), standard EKF and SEIF are presented. All of the results convincingly show that ISEIF yields more consistent and accurate estimates compared to SEIF and preserves the scalability advantage over EKF, as well.

AB The autonomous vehicle studiesrecently have been accelerated to ensure more secure, efficient, and comfortable transportation. Non-linearity in the power-train makes longitudinal control of autonomous vehicles difficult at low speeds. Additionally, rapid acceleration and deceleration (due to the behavior of the surrounding vehicles) increase complexity in control of such systems. In this study, we designed a novel longitudinal controller including the reverse plant model of the vehicle to overcome these problems. The complete controller is designed using parameters known to OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturer) with vehicle CAN bus signals. The longitudinal controller consists of two parts: The outer controller which determines the target speed according to lead vehicle's speed and the inner controller which determines the accelerator pedal percentage and brake requests. The inner controller includes PI followed by the reverse plant model with a virtual load sensor. This model enables control of a vehicle with non-linear power-train. The designed controller performance was tested on a city bus with a diesel engine and automatic transmission. Vehicle test results proved, that the designed controller is capable of controlling an autonomous vehicle with nonlinear power-train dynamics with onboard computational capacity even at low speeds.

AB Autonomous vehicles will have a major impact on parking facility designs in the future. Compared to regular car-parks that have only two rows of vehicles in each island, future car-parks (for autonomous vehicles) can have multiple rows of vehicles stacked behind each other. Although this multi-row layout reduces parking space, it can cause blockage if a certain vehicle is barricaded by other vehicles and cannot leave the facility. To release barricaded vehicles, the car-park operator has to relocate some of the vehicles to create a clear pathway for the blocked vehicle to exit. The extent of vehicle relocation depends on the layout design of the car-park. To find the optimal car-park layout with minimum relocations, we present a mixed-integer non-linear program that treats each island in the car-park as a queuing system. We solve the problem using Benders decomposition for an exact answer and we present a heuristic algorithm to find a reasonable upper-bound of the mathematical model. We show that autonomous vehicle car-parks can decrease the need for parking space by an average of 62% and a maximum of 87%. This revitalization of space that was previously used for parking can be socially beneficial if car-parks are converted into commercial and residential land-uses. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We have commercially deployed an infrastructure-vehicle cooperative autonomous driving system and verified its superiority over on-vehicle only autonomous driving systems. However, we have also identified network communication as the main technical roadblock for reliable cooperative autonomous driving. Hence, the goal of this article is to help the communications research community to better understand the real-world communication challenges in cooperative autonomous driving, as well as to introduce practical solutions for establishing a good baseline for further research and development efforts. Specifically, we introduce the real-world network communication challenges: first, the current mobile network bandwidth is constraining the uploading of raw sensing data, which is crucial for cloud-based applications such as deep learning model training and high-definition map generation and so on. Second, the network latency jitters remain high for a considerable portion of a vehicle's trip, greatly impacting the reliability and safety of the operations of autonomous vehicles. To address these two challenges, we have developed, deployed, and verified two practical solutions. First, a sensing compression strategy to cope with the network bandwidth challenge. Second, an adaptive fusion engine to cope with the latency variation challenge.

AB Due to digitalization trends and rapid technological development, cars are becoming more technologically advanced with an on-going trend towards fully automated vehicles. Understanding possible changes in user preferences and the impact on mobility of autonomous driving is of great importance for policy and transport planning authorities in light of urbanization trends, demographic change, and environmental challenges. Despite the relevance of the topic, there are limited empirical insights on user preferences, once autonomous driving becomes available. To close this gap and analyze the potential changes in the value of travel time savings (VTTS) resulting from the availability of autonomous driving, an online survey using revealed and stated preference methods was conducted. In the survey user preferences toward currently available and future available modes of transportation were assessed using two discrete choice experiments. VTTS calculations are based on an estimated joint mixed logit model. The results of the study show an average VTTS reduction of 41% for autonomous driving compared to driving a conventional car, however, only for commuting trips. For leisure or shopping trips, no significant changes in the VTTS were found. Considering shared autonomous vehicles (SAV), the results indicate that using SAV is perceived as a less attractive option than using a privately owned autonomous vehicle. Translating the results into policy implications, a potential conflict between individual benefits of autonomous driving and societal goals is identified. Finally, policy recommendations are discussed.

AB Autonomous vehicles are considered to have great potentials in improving transportation safety and efficiency. Autonomous follow driving is one of the highly probable application forms of autonomous vehicles in the near future. In this article, we aim at the basic autonomous following form with one follower and one leader. Proper longitudinal regulation of the follower vehicle is essential for the driving quality of the two-vehicle platoon. Focusing on this problem, a novel longitudinal control method composing of a learning-based acceleration decision phase and an internal model-based acceleration tracking phase is proposed for the follower vehicle. In the acceleration decision phase, proper acceleration commands of the follower that adjusts the following distance converging to the target value are determined by a near-optimal acceleration policy which is obtained through an online reinforcement learning algorithm named neural dynamic programming. In the acceleration tracking phase, throttle and brake control commands that drive the vehicle as the decided acceleration are derived by an internal model control structure. The performance of our proposed method is verified by simulation experiments conducted with CarSim, an industry recognized vehicle dynamic simulator.

AB Research on the use of autonomous vehicles as a mode of public transport in a city context is lacking. This paper focuses on the use of recently established autonomous buses (self-driving electric shuttle buses) running along a regular public transport line in a residential area of Oslo, Norway. We use a mixed-methods approach based on survey and interview data from two independent studies. The paper examines intentions to use autonomous buses before and after these were introduced in the case area as well as how passengers experience traveling by autonomous bus. Results show that the intention to use the autonomous buses was mostly positive both before and after using them. Most users felt safe while traveling by autonomous bus. Two suggestions for improvement made by the users were to: increase the speed and reduce the abrupt breaking of the autonomous buses. Overall, outcomes from this paper suggest that residents would be willing to use autonomous buses if these offer more frequent bus departures than the existing ones. However, as full automation has not been achieved yet and there is a host on board who can control the vehicle if necessary, passenger experiences and intentions to use should be reassessed with fully automated buses in future studies.

AB The autonomous driving industry has mushroomed over the past decade. Although autonomous driving has undoubtedly become one of the most promising technologies of this century, its development faces multiple challenges, of which security is the major concern. In this article, we present a thorough analysis of autonomous driving security. First, the attack surface of autonomous driving is presented. After an analysis of the operation of autonomous driving in terms of key components and technologies, the security of autonomous driving is elaborated in four dimensions: 1) sensors; 2) operating system; 3) control system; and 4) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. Sensor security is examined from five components, which are mainly responsible for self-positioning and environmental perception. The analysis of operating system security, the second dimension, is concentrated on the robot operating system. Concerning the control system security, the controller area network is approached mainly from vulnerabilities and protection measures. The fourth dimension, V2X communication security, is probed from four categories of attacks: 1) authenticity/identification; 2) availability; 3) data integrity; and 4) confidentiality with corresponding solutions. Moreover, the drawbacks of existing methods adopted in the four dimensions are also provided. Finally, a conceptual multilayer defense framework is proposed to secure the information flow from external communication to the physical autonomous vehicle.

AB The development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) holds a high potential for improving security, reducing congestion, increasing fuel efficiency, and saving time. Various studies conducted on the implementation of AVs predict that fully autonomous vehicles will be available for the public in the 2020s. However, it will take another three decades, at least, for these vehicles and technologies to be accepted among the general masses and become reliable and affordable for use. Nonetheless, while a great deal has been stated regarding autonomous cars, little attention has been paid to autonomous public transport, more specifically, autonomous buses (ABs). The present report analyzed the psychological barriers preventing the complete implementation of ABs through data collected from focus group (FG) discussions. The main objective of the FGs was to determine the factors influencing perceptions regarding ABs and their acceptability. The most important factors from the positive side were the reduction of personnel costs, the potential to decrease congestion, waiting time at intersections, and reduced emissions. On the other hand, the most important negative factors were an increase in vehicle and infrastructure costs, safety risks under certain conditions (e.g., system failures, terrorist attacks, etc.), and the possible reduction of employment opportunities.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Given the current capabilities of autonomous vehicles, one can easily imagine autonomous vehicles being released on the road in the near future. However, it can be assumed that this transition will not be instantaneous, suggesting that autonomous vehicles will have to be capable of driving in a mixed environment, with both humans and autonomous vehicles. To guarantee smooth integration and maintain the nuanced social interactions on the road, a shared mental model must be developed. This means that the behaviors of human-driven vehicles and their typical interactions in collaborative maneuvers must be modeled and understood in an accurate and precise manner. Then, by integrating such models into autonomous planning, we can develop control frameworks that mimic this shared understanding. We present a driver modeling framework that estimates an empirical reachable set to capture typical lane changing behaviors. This method can predict driver behaviors with up to 90% accuracy and cumulative errors less than 1 m. Leveraging this driver model in an optimization-based trajectory planning framework, we can generate trajectories that are similar to those performed by humans. By using this modeling and planning framework, we can improve understanding and integration of nuanced interactions to improve collaboration between humans and autonomy.

AB The paper presents the application of Monte Carlo simulation in the behavior analysis of an autonomous underwater vehicle. Due to the highly nonlinear dynamics and existence of uncertain parameters in the models, there is not a straightforward method to analyze the behavior of an autonomous underwater vehicle. The objective of this article is to introduce a Monte Carlo campaign for an autonomous underwater vehicle 6-degree-of-freedom model to examine the effects of uncertain parameters on the mission objectives. Uncertainties in the model are considered in several categories, consisting of hydrodynamic and added mass coefficients, control instruments (sensors and actuators), environmental conditions and initial conditions. Monte Carlo simulations are run for a typical autonomous underwater vehicle moving from the water surface to reach a predetermined depth and heading during the mission time. For this purpose, 6-degree-of-freedom software is developed in C<?h-.6 ?>+<?h-1.6 ?>+ which is a fast and visual programming software. Using an example, it is shown that simulation results can be used for tuning of guidance algorithm. Moreover, the proposed concept is applicable for analysis of other types of autonomous ocean systems.

AB We propose a service network design problem for the tactical planning of parcel delivery with autonomous vehicles in SAE level 4. We consider a heterogeneous infrastructure wherein such vehicles may only drive in feasible zones but need to be guided elsewhere by manually operated vehicles in platoons. Our model decides on the fleet size and mix as well as on the routing of vehicles and goods. We observe cost savings and show that the strategies to coordinate a fleet using platooning depend upon the infrastructure, demand, and fleet mix. We discuss our results and identify areas for future research.

AB One of the major challenges that autonomous cars are facing today is driving in urban environments. To make it a reality, autonomous vehicles require the ability to communicate with other road users and understand their intentions. Such interactions are essential between vehicles and pedestrians, the most vulnerable road users. Understanding pedestrian behavior, however, is not intuitive and depends on various factors, such as demographics of the pedestrians, traffic dynamics, environmental conditions, and so on. In this paper, we identify these factors by surveying pedestrian behavior studies, both the classical works on pedestrian-driver interaction and the modern ones that involve autonomous vehicles. To this end, we will discuss various methods of studying pedestrian behavior and analyze how the factors identified in the literature are interrelated. We will also review the practical applications aimed at solving the interaction problem, including design approaches for autonomous vehicles that communicate with pedestrians and visual perception and reasoning algorithms tailored to understanding pedestrian intention. Based on our findings, we will discuss the open problems and propose future research directions.

AB Aquaculture net cage inspection and maintenance is a central issue in fish farming. Inspection using autonomous underwater vehicles is a promising solution. This paper proposes laser-camera triangulation for pose estimation to enable autonomous net following for an autonomous vehicle. The laser triangulation 3D data is experimentally compared to a doppler velocity log (DVL) in an active fish farm. We show that our system is comparable in performance to a DVL for distance and angular pose measurements. Laser triangulation is promising as a short distance ranging sensor for autonomous vehicles at a low cost compared to acoustic sensors.

AB Since 2017, a research team from the Technical University of Munich has developed a software stack for autonomous driving. The software was used to participate in the Roborace Season Alpha Championship. The championship aims to achieve autonomous race cars competing with different software stacks against each other. In May 2019, during a software test in Modena, Italy, the greatest danger in autonomous driving became reality: A minor change in environmental influences led an extensively tested software to crash into a barrier at speed. Crashes with autonomous vehicles have happened before but a detailed explanation of why software failed and what part of the software was not working correctly is missing in research articles. In this paper we present a general method that can be used to display an autonomous vehicle disengagement to explain in detail what happened. This method is then used to display and explain the crash from Modena. Firstly a brief introduction into the modular software stack that was used in the Modena event, consisting of three individual parts perception, planning, and control is given. Furthermore, the circumstances causing the crash are elaborated in detail.By presented and explaining in detail which software part failed and contributed to the crash we can discuss further software improvements. As a result, we present necessary functions that need to be integrated in an autonomous driving software stack to prevent such a vehicle behavior causing a fatal crash. In addition we suggest an enhancement of the current disengagement reports for autonomous driving regarding a detailed explanation of the software part that was causing the disengagement. In the outlook of this paper we present two additional software functions for assessing the tire and control performance of the vehicle to enhance the autonomous.

AB A pure-pursuit navigational control algorithm in an autonomous articulated-steer vehicle was studied as a simple method for path-following. Paths were created using GPS coordinates and the articulated-steer vehicle programmed to follow those paths using a pure-pursuit (goal-seeking) path-following algorithm. A GUI was developed in Lab VIEW to read RTK-GPS coordinates, hydraulic pressure and articulation angle, and control the articulated-steer vehicle. The vehicle was tested for its ability to follow five different paths with two speeds and three control pulse signals. Path following succeeded with lower vehicle speed and full pulse signal for the straight and sinusoidal paths. Averaged path-following errors ranged from 6 to 19 cm as the turn radius increased. For a 90 degree turn, the path-following error was almost 80 cm. Path-following improvements could be made with faster control signal updates and a variable look-ahead distance based on vehicle speed and required turning angle. It was concluded that the control architecture is a good basis for navigation of an articulated-steer autonomous vehicle.

AB We introduce a two-echelon urban delivery problem with second-level unmanned vehicles. This problem typically applies for delivering parcels or other small commodities to pedestrianized areas such as campuses or residential clusters. To model the proposed vehicle routing problem, we introduce a mixed-integer program. We further propose construction heuristics and a hybrid metaheuristic approach with backtracking for solving larger instances. A sensitivity analysis for vehicle speed combinations reveals that increasing small autonomous vehicle (SAV) speeds has only very limited effects on cost. We therefore recommend to keep SAV speeds rather low because of a more pedestrian friendly environment in practical implementations.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles are frequently used for survey missions and monitoring tasks, however, manipulation and intervention tasks are still largely performed with a human in the loop. Employing autonomous vehicles for these tasks has received a growing interest in the last ten years, and few pioneering projects have been funded on this topic. Among these projects, the Italian MARIS project had the goal of developing technologies and methodologies for the use of autonomous underwater vehicle manipulator systems in underwater manipulation and transportation tasks. This work presents the developed control framework, the mechatronic integration, and the project's final experimental results on floating underwater intervention.

TI Hierarchical Driving Strategy for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles
   Making a Protected Left Turn at Signalized Intersections
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING PART A-SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE Hierarchical driving strategy (HDS); Autonomous driving; Left-turn
   intersection scenario; Deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
AB Left-turn execution in autonomous driving at urban intersections is often complex and characterized by unpredicted events, such as vehicles speeding and running a red light. Despite these hazards, autonomous vehicles must drive through intersections safely and efficiently. To solve this problem, a new hierarchical driving strategy (HDS) is proposed for connected and autonomous vehicles making a protected left turn at signalized intersections, which combines the rule-based method and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The high level of the HDS is the rule-based decision-making module, and the low level is the driving skill, which is dependent on the status. Specifically, the vehicle status when turning left is divided into safe and alert statuses. Further, DRL is used to train the driving skill of the vehicle for each status. The HDS design effectively combines the advantages of end-to-end driving. Moreover, the algorithm was experimentally evaluated in multiple protected left-turn scenarios. Compared with the pure rule-based method, the HDS achieved a 34% reduction in failure rate in the test scenario, and the driving behavior of the autonomous vehicle employing HDS was more intelligent. Moreover, the HDS is highly robust to complex scenarios.

ID ROBOT
AB The autonomous vehicle is an automated system equipped with features like environment perception, decision-making, motion planning, and control and execution technology. Navigating in an unstructured and complex environment is a huge challenge for autonomous vehicles, due to the irregular shape of road, the requirement of real-time planning, and the nonholonomic constraints of vehicle. This paper presents a motion planning method, based on the Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network, to guide the autonomous vehicle in unstructured environments. The proposed algorithm extracts the drivable region from the perception grid map based on the global path, which is available in the road network. The sample points are randomly selected in the drivable region, and a gradient descent method is used to train the RBF network. The parameters of the motion-planning algorithm are verified through the simulation and experiment. It is observed that the proposed approach produces a flexible, smooth, and safe path that can fit any road shape. The method is implemented on autonomous vehicle and verified against many outdoor scenes; furthermore, a comparison of proposed method with the existing well-known Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) method is presented. The experimental results show that the proposed method is highly effective in planning the vehicle path and offers better motion quality.

AB This paper presents a fully distributed interaction protocol for connected self-driving cars negotiating the access a traffic junction. The vehicles coordination has been reformulated as an equivalent virtual platoon control problem. The desired vehicles spacing within the platoon is chosen so to avoid the side and rear-end collisions and is controlled by a cooperative non-linear control algorithm, based on potential functions. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system has been analytically proved by leveraging the LaSalles Invariance Principle. The analysis of the convergence rate has resulted in an effective tuning tool ensuring that the desired formation is achieved before vehicles reach the intersection. Most notably, results from an in-vehicle experimental validation are presented. The experiments were carried out on three self-driving cars connected through a V2V communication infrastructure based on the IEEE 802.11p protocol. The experimental results confirm the theoretical analysis and reveal the effectiveness of the control approach for autonomously and safely negotiating a generic traffic junction.

AB This paper concerns the robust gain-scheduling control issue for autonomous path following systems with stochastic network-induced delay. Firstly, to effectively approximate the highly nonlinear tire dynamics, the linear fractional transformation formulations are employed to describe the tire cornering stiffness with a norm-bounded uncertainty. Secondly, by taking the data dropout and delay encountered in signal computation and transmission into account, a more generalized lumped delay form is proposed to unify the time-varying data dropout and network-induced delay. Moreover, a Markovian process is presented to describe the lumped delay as a stochastic distribution. Thirdly, to address the issue of varying vehicle velocity, a linear parameter varying model is established to capture vehicle lateral behaviors. Based on the stochastic stability theory, a new robust gain-scheduling path following control method is proposed for the autonomous vehicles. Finally, the experimental study is presented to bridge the gap between the theoretical and practical investigations on path following control of autonomous vehicles, and results validate the superior performance of the proposed method compared with existing works.

AB This paper addresses the problem of distributed state estimation in a multi-vehicle framework. Each vehicle aims to estimate its own state relying on locally available measurements and limited communication with other vehicles in the vicinity. The dynamics of the problem are formulated as a discrete-time Kalman filtering problem with a sparsity constraint on the gain, and two different algorithms for computation of steady-state observer gains for arbitrary fixed measurement topologies are introduced. Their application to the practical problem of distributed localization in a formation of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) is detailed, supported by simulation results.

AB As a currently emerging technology and an emerging intelligent mode of transport, autonomous vehicles (AVs) with lots of potential advantages need attention in terms of acceptability of their users. This research incorporates three psychological factors of perceived trust, perceived value, and perceived enjoyment into the technology acceptance model, and explores the influence of these factors on the potential use intention of AVs users. In this study, the questionnaire data from 232 participants were analysed, and the structural equation model test study model was adopted, and nine hypotheses proposed in this study were verified. The results show that perceived enjoyment, perceived trust, perceived usefulness, and attitude have a direct positive impact on users' usage intentions. Perceived value, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use have a direct positive impact on user attitudes. In addition, perceived ease of use has also been shown to directly affect perceived usefulness. This study constructs and demonstrates a model of autonomous vehicle acceptance. This model can be used for user acceptance research of unmanned vehicles. The research expands the theory of technology acceptance model and its applicable fields, and enriches the theory of user research on unmanned vehicles. This study provides predictors of AVs acceptance for AVs designers, automakers, automotive policy makers, and related practitioners. Help them make actionable autonomous vehicle-related decisions to promote high-acceptance autonomous vehicle design and user intent for autonomous vehicles.

AB BACKGROUND: Autonomous vehicles can be classified on a scale of automation from 0 to 5, where level 0 corresponds to vehicles that have no automation to level 5 where the vehicle is fully autonomous and it is not possible for the human occupant to take control. At level 2, the driver needs to retain attention as they are in control of at least some systems. Level 3-4 vehicles are capable of full control but the human occupant might be required to, or desire to, intervene in some circumstances. This means that there could be extended periods of time where the driver is relaxed, but other periods of time when they need to drive.
   OBJECTIVE: The seat must therefore be designed to be comfortable in at least two different types of use case.
   METHODS: This driving simulator study compares the comfort experienced in a seat from a production hybrid vehicle whilst being used in a manual driving mode and in autonomous mode for a range of postures.
   RESULTS: It highlights how discomfort is worse for cases where the posture is non-optimal for the task. It also investigates the design of head and neckrests to mitigate neck discomfort, and shows that a well-designed neckrest is beneficial for drivers in autonomous mode.

AB Over the past several decades, the development of technologies and the production of autonomous vehicles have enhanced the need for intelligent intersection management systems. Subsequently, growing interest in studying the traffic management of autonomous vehicles at intersections has been evident, which indicates a critical need to conduct a systematic literature review on this topic. This paper offers a systematic review of the proposed methodologies for intelligent intersection management systems and presents the remaining research gaps and possible future research approaches. We consider both pure autonomous vehicle traffic and mixed traffic at four-way signalized and unsignalized intersection(s). We searched for articles published from 2008 to 2019, and identified 105 primary studies. We applied the thematic analysis method to analyze the extracted data, which led to the identification of four main classes of methodologies, namely rule-based, optimization, hybrid, and machine learning methods. We also compared how well the methods satisfy their goals, namely efficiency, safety, ecology, and passenger comfort. This analysis allowed us to determine the primary challenges of the presented methodologies and propose new approaches in this area.

AB For the last two decades, autonomous vehicles have been proposed and developed to extend the operational design domain from the motorway to urban environments. However, there have been few studies on autonomous driving for uncontrolled and blind intersections. This paper presents a proactive motion planning algorithm to enhance safety and traffic efficiency simultaneously for autonomous driving in uncontrolled blind intersections. The target states of approach motion are decided based on the field of view of the laser scanner and the pre-defined intersection map with connectivity information. The model predictive controller is used to follow the target states and determine the longitudinal motion of an autonomous vehicle. A Monte Carlo simulation with a case study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed proactive motion planner. The simulation results show that the risk caused by approaching vehicles from the occluded region is properly managed. In addition, the traffic flow is improved by reducing the required time to cross the intersections.

DE Human-vehicle shared control; autonomous vehicle; neuromuscular

AB Over a long period of time, the fully autonomous vehicle is far from commercial application. The concept of 'human-vehicle shared control (HVSC)' provides a promising solution to enhance autonomous driving safety. In order to characterize the evolution of the driver's feature in the process of HVSC, a dynamics model of HVSC with the driver's neuromuscular characteristic is proposed in this paper. It takes into account the driver's neuromuscular characteristics, such as stretch reflection, feedback stiffness, etc. By designing a model predictive control (MPC) controller, the feedback of the vehicle's state and steering torque is constructed. For validation of the model, driving simulation has been conducted in our table-based driving simulator. The vehicle state and the surface electromyography of the driver's arm working muscle group are collected simultaneously. Subsequently, the hierarchical least square (HLS) parameter identification and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) observer is used to identify and estimate the important characteristic parameters respectively based on the experimental results. The comparisons show that the HVSC can characterize the vehicle's dynamic state and the driver's personalized characteristic can be identified by HLS. This paper will serve as a theoretical basis of control strategy allocation between the human and vehicle during shared control for L3 class autonomous vehicle.

AB A versatile architecture is presented to implement autonomous vehicles. The focus idea consists of a set of standalone modules, called wireless robotic components wireless robotic components (WRCs). Each component performs a particular function by means of a radio modem interface, a processing unit, and a sensor/actuator. The components interact through a coordinator that redirects asynchronous requests to the appropriate WRCs, configuring a built-in network. The WRC architecture has been tested in marine and terrestrial platforms to perform tasks of waypoint and wall following. Results show that the tested system complies with adaptability and portability that allow conforming a variety of autonomous vehicles.

TI Maturity in Automated Driving on Public Roads: A Review of the Six-Year
   Autonomous Vehicle Tester Program
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Review
DE operations; automated vehicles
AB With support from United States Department of Transportation and state policies and regulations, in recent years manufacturers have initiated automated vehicle (AV) testing on public roads. Vehicle autonomy has grown from simulations and controlled environments to real-world driving environments with normal traffic. California is one of the states with an autonomous vehicle tester (AVT) program. It was established as early as 2014 for authorized manufacturers to test their AVs on public roads. This review examines permit holder information, autonomous mileage reports, autonomous vehicle disengagement reports, and autonomous vehicle collision reports over a six-year period. In addition to reviewing operating experience and the growth of AV testing, this study conducted in-depth analysis to evaluate maturity in automated driving technology and reported disengagement causes. It shows that a state-run AVT program boosts maturity in automated driving technology. At the same time, by participating in the AVT program, AV manufacturers showed a trend toward improvement in their AV technologies (e.g., an 8% fall in disengagements caused by hardware and software discrepancies and a 12% fall in those caused by perception discrepancies). States are encouraged to initiate or continue their AVT programs for the benefit of autonomous driving on public roads.

AB This study presents the development of an output feedback control for regulating the movement of an autonomous submersible vehicles in the tridimensional space. The controller formulation applies the Averaged Sub-Gradient Integral Sliding Mode which is fed with the estimation of the translational velocity states by a distributed super-twisting algorithm. The structure of the autonomous submersible vehicles dynamics permits the implementation of the ASG algorithm using the estimates of translation velocity. The proposed scheme solves a non-linear extremum seeking problem that aims to minimize a non-strictly convex function that depends on the tracking error defined by the difference of some suitable reference trajectories and the coordinates of the submarine center of mass. The desired reference trajectories were designed to force the autonomous submersible vehicles three-dimensional motion to a continuous circuit in an oscillating shape over the horizontal plane combined with a submersion on the z-axis. The comparison between the proposed controller, the ASG with complete knowledge of the states and the state feedback controller is presented. This comparison confirms the output feedback ASG controller forced the autonomous submersible vehicles to the desired trajectory with a notable difference in the magnitude of the control given the estimation of the states. These outcomes justify the potential contributions of the suggested ASG integrated with the super-twisting algorithm to obtain the local minimization of the evaluated functional depending on the tracking error. The results justify the potential contributions of the suggested ASG with the super-twisting algorithm to regulate the position of the autonomous submersible vehicles to the desired trajectory.

ID ALLOCATION; DESIGN
AB Platooning strategy is an important component of autonomous driving technology. Autonomous vehicles in platoons are often equipped with a variety of on-board sensors to detect the surrounding environment. The abundant data collected by autonomous vehicles in platoons can be transmitted to the infrastructure through vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications using the IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function (DCF) mechanism and then uploaded to the cloud platform through the Internet. The cloud platform extracts useful information and then sends it back to the autonomous vehicles respectively. In this way, autonomous vehicles in platoons can detect emergency conditions and make a decision in time. The characteristics of platoons would cause a fair-access problem in the V2I communications, i.e., vehicles in the platoons moving on different lanes with different velocities would have different resident time within the infrastructure's coverage and thus successfully send different amounts of data to the infrastructure. In this case, the vehicles with different velocities will receive different amounts of useful information from the cloud. As a result, vehicles with a higher velocity are more likely to suffer from a traffic accident as compared to the vehicles with a lower velocity. Hence, this paper considers the fair-access problem and proposes a fair-access scheme to ensure that vehicles with different velocities successfully transmit the same amount of data by adaptively adjusting the minimum contention window of each vehicle according to its velocity. Moreover, the normalized throughput of the proposed scheme is derived. The validity of the fair-access scheme is demonstrated by simulation.

AB The problem with lidar placement is finding a lidar position that reduces the dead zone and improves the point cloud resolution. A lidar placement method is thus proposed for the multiple lidar system of autonomous vehicles to resolve this problem. With the introduction of the lidar occupancy grid, the problem is formulated as an optimization problem. A genetic algorithm is subsequently applied to solve the optimization problem. The experimental results using commercial lidars are subsequently presented to show the usefulness of the proposed method.

AB In this paper, we present feedback control laws for an autonomous vehicle with rigidly mounted range sensors to track a desired curve. In particular, we consider a vehicle that has a group of rays around two center rays that are perpendicular to the velocity of the vehicle. Under such a sensor configuration, singularities are bound to occur in the curve tracking feedback control law when tracking concave curves. To overcome this singularity, we derive a hybrid strategy of switching between control laws when the vehicle gets close to singularities. Rigorous proof and extensive simulation results verify the validity of the proposed feedback control law.

AB We propose an urban traffic management scheme for an all connected vehicle environment. If all the vehicles are autonomous, for example, in smart city projects or future's dense city centers, then such an environment does not need a physical traffic signal. Instead, an intersection control server processes data streams from approaching vehicles, periodically solves an optimization problem, and assigns to each vehicle an optimal arrival time that ensures safety while significantly reducing number of stops and intersection delays. The scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), and is solved by IBM CPLEX optimization package. The optimization outputs (scheduled access/arrival times) are sent to all approaching vehicles. The autonomous vehicles adjust their speed accordingly by a proposed trajectory planning algorithm with the aim of accessing the intersection at their scheduled times. A customized traffic microsimulation environment is developed to determine the potentials of the proposed solution in comparison to two baseline scenarios. In addition, the proposed MILP-based intersection control scheme is modified and simulated for a mixed traffic consisting of autonomous and human-controlled vehicles, all connected through a wireless communication to the intersection controller of a signalized intersection.

Even though self-driving technologies have been studied for a few decades and several successful applications have been demonstrated, autonomous industry vehicles are currently applied only in some specific scenarios with very low speed and fixed routes and are typically implemented in the indoor closed area of small-scale warehouses. In this article, we introduce the main perception and localization approaches of autonomous cargo transportation vehicles for industrial applications. We also demonstrate how these technologies can enable autonomous cargo transportation in the Hong Kong International Airport.

AB Traffic jams in large cities, in addition to having a very high economic cost, cause an increase in emissions generated by vehicles over the same route being driven under normal conditions. In recent years, there has been a rapid evolution in the technologies applied to the field of autonomous vehicles. There are currently commercial solutions for assisted driving and semi-autonomous driving systems, with very favorable forecasts for reaching a completely autonomous vehicle scenario in the coming decades. This new environment generates opportunities and challenges to reduce congestion in scenarios with autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles. This paper focuses on the automatic optimization of the passage of vehicles through intersections. The intersections are one of the most conflict-generating elements in a traffic network. This type of conflicts arises because the intersections must manage multiple traffic flows with different priorities and preferences, often leading to traffic jams. The problem has been addressed by proposing three mechanisms to model any type of intersection, to calculate the roads with fewer points of conflict between their inputs and outputs, and to optimize the arrival rate of vehicles using a Genetic Algorithm to achieve the maximum performance of the intersection. To validate this solution, a cellular automata simulator has been developed, which can be adapted to both autonomous and conventional vehicle scenarios and can provide realistic results when certain conditions are met. The results obtained have been compared with other traditional solutions (priority and traffic lights) using microscopic traffic simulations, and with those obtained in other studies showing the advantages of the proposed system. The proposed systems achieve a throughput improvement between 9.21% and 36.98% compared with the traditional solutions.

AB Autonomous vehicles are expected to disrupt mobility but face consumer reluctance. Diffused through carsharing services, the technology could become more accessible and overcome initial skepticism. Consequently, carsharing with shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) can provide the combined benefits of autonomous driving technology and access-based consumption. Whereas first investigations into the topic provide projections in adoption preferences and first impacts, the literature lacks a holistic understanding of drivers, barriers, and future developments in carsharing with SAVs over the next ten years. We conducted a four-stage exploratory Delphi-study with 40 international experts to elicit these factors. Key findings include the strong perception of technological aspects, consumer acceptance considerations, and legislative concerns. Remarkably, the factors of sustainability and ethics were perceived as secondary. We conclude our paper with implications and recommendations for managers, policy makers, and future academic research.

AB Although autonomous vehicle technology has evolved significantly in recent years, the navigation of self-driving vehicles in complex scenarios is still an open issue. One of the major challenges in these conditions is safe navigation on roads open to public traffic. The main issue is the interaction of the autonomous vehicle with regular traffic, as the behaviors and intentions of human-driven vehicles are hard to predict and understand. In this paper we propose a strategy to allow an autonomous vehicle to safely cross a multi-lane roundabout. Our approach uses a High-Definition (HD) map to predict at lane level the future situation, harnessing the concept of virtual instances of road users, which is a key concept in anticipating the situation in a roundabout that can be represented by a navigation graph with loops. This paper presents a methodology that uses intervals representing road occupancy by vehicles, with the road being widened to reflect uncertainties in localization. Our method safely avoids collisions and guarantees that no priority constraints are violated during the insertion maneuver. Moreover, the method does not provide an overly cautious insertion policy, i.e., an autonomous vehicle does not wait for a long time before the insertion. The performance of our strategy was evaluated using the SUMO simulation framework. To better evaluate the complexity of the simulation scenario, a highly interactive vehicle flow was generated using real dynamic traffic data from the INTERACTION dataset. We report real tests carried out with an experimental self-driving vehicle on a test circuit. Our results show that this approach is easy to integrate into an embedded system and that it allows roundabouts to be crossed with a high level of safety.

AB While driving a vehicle safely at its handling limit is essential in autonomous vehicles in Level 5 autonomy, it is a very challenging task for current conventional methods. Therefore, this study proposes a novel controller of trajectory planning and motion control for autonomous driving through manifold corners at the handling limit to improve the speed and shorten the lap time of the vehicle. The proposed controller innovatively combines the advantages of conventional model-based control algorithm, model-free reinforcement learning algorithm, and prior expert knowledge, to improve the training efficiency for autonomous driving in extreme conditions. The reward shaping of this algorithm refers to the procedure and experience of race training of professional drivers in real time. After training on track maps that exhibit different levels of difficulty, the proposed controller implemented a superior strategy compared to the original reference trajectory, and can to other tougher maps based on the basic driving knowledge learned from the simpler map, which verifies its superiority and exten-sibility. We believe this technology can be further applied to daily life to expand the application scenarios and maneuvering envelopes of autonomous vehicles.

AB In order to reduce costs for a larger warehouse or expand the floor space of a small warehouse, it is impossible to implement this with a traditional warehouse, which is characterized as poorly utilized space. For the efficient storage and retrieval, the smart warehouse system with autonomous mobile-rack vehicles can optimize the space utilization by providing only a few open aisles at a time for accessing the racks with minimal intervention. This paper deals with designing the vehicle robust controller for maintaining safe spacing with collision avoidance in the fully automated warehouse. The compact vehicle dynamics are presented for the interconnected string of vehicles. Next, the string stability with safe working space of the mobile-rack vehicles has been described for guaranteeing complete autonomous logistics in smart warehouse. In addition, the controller order has been significantly reduced to a low-order system without performance degradation for real implementation. This control method can guarantee control stability as well as performances of mobile-rack vehicles against unavoidable uncertainties, disturbances, and noises for warehouse automation in the extremely cold environment without rail rack. Finally, the autonomous mobile-rack vehicle system is to become the promising vision of future smart warehouse technology in autonomous logistics.

AB The technology of autonomous vehicles is expected to revolutionize the operation of road transport systems. The penetration rate of autonomous vehicles will be low at the early stage of their deployment. It is a challenge to explore the effects of autonomous vehicles and their penetration on heterogeneous traffic flow dynamics. This paper aims to investigate this issue. An improved cellular automaton was employed as the modeling platform for our study. In particular, two sets of rules for lane changing were designed to address mild and aggressive lane changing behavior. With extensive simulation studies, we obtained some promising results. First, the introduction of autonomous vehicles to road traffic could considerably improve traffic flow, particularly the road capacity and free-flow speed. And the level of improvement increases with the penetration rate. Second, the lane-changing frequency between neighboring lanes evolves with traffic density along a fundamental-diagram-like curve. Third, the impacts of autonomous vehicles on the collective traffic flow characteristics are mainly related to their smart maneuvers in lane changing and car following, and it seems that the car-following impact is more pronounced.

AB Autonomous driving is a key technology for intelligent logistics in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). In autonomous driving, the appearance of incomplete point clouds that lose geometric and semantic information is inevitable due to the limitations of occlusion, sensor resolution, and viewing angle when Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) is applied. The existence of incomplete point clouds, especially incomplete vehicle point clouds, would lead to a reduction in the accuracy of object detection, traffic alerts, and collision avoidance for autonomous driving vehicles. Existing point cloud completion networks, such as the Point Fractal Network (PF-Net), focus on the accuracy of point cloud completion without considering the efficiency of the inference process, which makes it difficult for them to be deployed for vehicle point cloud repair in autonomous driving. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose an efficient deep learning approach to repair incomplete vehicle point clouds in autonomous driving accurately and efficiently. In the proposed method, an efficient downsampling algorithm that combines incremental sampling and one-time sampling is presented to improve the inference speed of the PF-Net based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, a real dataset is used, and autonomous driving scenes are created, where three incomplete vehicle point clouds with 5 different sizes are used for three autonomous driving situations. The improved PF-Net can achieve speedups of over 19x with almost the same accuracy when compared to the original PF-Net. Experimental results demonstrate that the improved PF-Net can be applied to efficiently complete vehicle point clouds in autonomous driving.

AB In this paper, an adaptive depth and heading control of an autonomous underwater vehicle using the concept of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is designed. The autonomous underwater vehicle dynamics have six degrees of freedom, which are highly nonlinear and time-varying. It is affected by environmental effects such as ocean currents and tidal waves. Due to nonlinear dynamics designing, a stable controller in an autonomous underwater vehicle is a difficult end to achieve. Fuzzy logic and neural network control blocks make up the proposed control design to control the depth and heading angle of autonomous underwater vehicle. The neural network is trained using the back-propagation algorithm. In the presence of noise and parameter variation, the proposed adaptive controller's performance is compared with that of the self-tuning fuzzy-PID and fuzzy logic controller. Simulations are conducted to obtain the performance of both controller models in terms of overshoot, and the rise time and the result of the proposed adaptive controller exhibit superior control performance and can eliminate the effect of uncertainty.

AB Driving maneuvers try to objectify user needs regarding the driving dynamics for a vehicle concept. As autonomous vehicles will not be driven by people, the driving style that merges the individual aspects of driving dynamics, like user comfort, will be part of the vehicle concept itself. New driving maneuvers are, therefore, necessary to objectify the driving style of autonomous vehicle concepts with all its interdependencies relating to the individual aspects. This paper presents a methodology to design such driving maneuvers and includes a pilot study and a user study. As an example, the methodology was applied to the parameters of user comfort and travel time. The driven maneuvers resulted in statistical equations to objectify the interdependencies of these two aspects. Finally, this paper provides an outlook for needed maneuvers in order to tackle the entire driving style with its multidimensional facets.

AB This paper presents a method of particle filter localization for autonomous vehicles, based on two-dimensional (2D) laser sensor measurements and road features. To navigate an urban environment, an autonomous vehicle should be able to estimate its location with a reasonable accuracy. By detecting road features such as curbs and road markings, a grid-based feature map is constructed using 2D laser range finder measurements. Then, a particle filter is employed to accurately estimate the position of the autonomous vehicle. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is verified and compared to accurate Differential Global Positioning Systems (DGPS) data through real road driving experiments.

AB Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) provide on demand point-to-point transportation for passengers. This service has been extensively studied using dispatch heuristics and agent based simulations of large urban areas. However, these approaches make no mathematical guarantees of the passenger throughput for the SAV network. This study builds on the dynamic queuing model design of Kang and Levin which provides a maximum stability dispatch policy for SAVs. This model is extended to include rebalancing of empty vehicles to regions of high demand. The modified dispatch policy is proven to maximize throughput. Simulation results show that this dispatch policy reduces waiting times (between vehicle dispatch and passenger pickup) compared to the original formulation. However, vehicle time traveling empty increases in some scenarios. Simulation results also show that rebalancing often reduces passenger waiting times, but not when too many vehicles rebalance at once and are not available for dispatch.

AB The wireless power transfer shows great potential in the future for its safety and convenience. Autonomous underwater vehicle is one of the important tools to explore and develop oceans. In this study, we develop and analyze a wireless power transfer system based on magnetic resonance coupling to charge the autonomous underwater vehicle underwater. We have adopted a way that energy transmission underneath the vehicle and the coils in the wireless power transfer system were proposed to obtain a higher mutual inductance based on the shape of the vehicle in this study. In addition, we analyze the equivalent circuit model and propose a kind of impedance matching network to maintain system security. The coils we used in the proposed system are 20 turns and their radii are 70mm. The system works well with 100W output and 72% efficiency.

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
ID SYSTEM
AB In the medium-term, the number of semi-autonomous vehicles is expected to rise significantly. These changes in vehicle capabilities make it necessary to analyze their interaction with road infrastructure, which has been developed for human-driven vehicles. Current systems use artificial vision, recording the oncoming road and using the center and edgeline road markings to automatically facilitate keeping the vehicle within the lane. In addition to alignment and road markings, lane width has emerged as one of the geometric parameters that might cause disengagement and therefore must be assessed. The objective of this research was to study the impact of lane width on semi-autonomous vehicle performance. The automatic lateral control of this type of vehicle was tested along 81 lanes of an urban arterial comprising diverse widths. Results showed that the semi-autonomous system tended to fail on narrow lanes. There was a maximum width below which human control was always required-referred to as the human lane width-measuring 2.5 m. A minimum width above which automatic control was always possible-the automatic lane width-was established to be 2.75 m. Finally, a lane width of 2.72 m was found to have the same probability of automatic and human lateral control, namely the critical lane width. Following a similar methodology, these parameters could be determined for other vehicles, enhancing the interaction between autonomous vehicles and road infrastructure and thus supporting rapid deployment of autonomous technology without compromising safety.

AB This article investigates the acceptance of autonomous cars based on the role of attitudes toward autonomous vehicles, acceptance of technology, previous experiences, and gender. Using an online survey, which includes the Acceptance of Autonomous Vehicles (AVAS) and Technology Adoption Propensity scale (TAP), a sample of 1273 members of a university community was collected. Acceptance of using autonomous cars in a test drive and ordinary, real traffic scenarios, as well as the intention to buy one were measured via self-administered items. We used condi-tional process modeling to get a more detailed insight into the connections among these factors. The findings revealed that all four factors of attitudes towards autonomous vehicles (benefits in usefulness, benefits in situations, commonalities concerns, system concerns) but only the opti-mism factor of technology adaption propensity affected the acceptance. Dependency seemed to affect benefits in usefulness and the two concern variables. Gender differences are almost entirely explained away by the effects of attitudes. Previous experience had no significant effect in the model.

AB Every transportation plan in the medium and long term consider autonomous vehicles as a key solution for transport, which will reduce to a minimum traffic accidents and congestion, maximizing the use of the road. However, at present, these vehicles are still under development and they are not with acceptable figures for the placing on the market. A fundamental element on today obstacle detection is the laser scanner, which provides a three dimensional mesh that can represent all objects that are at a distance of 200 meters from the vehicle. Furthermore, the combination of GPS with inertial systems allows precise positioning on the road, if necessary reinforced with computer vision to achieve lane level positioning. However, there are situations, such as tunnels or urban roads with poor reception of GPS signals that make this positioning can be complicated, so much so that the autonomous vehicle requires human intervention to maintain the trajectory. This article describes a use of laser scanner technology to support positioning and maintaining the position even when the GPS and inertial systems are not sufficient to maintain the route. This system will be complementary to conventional guidance systems and works in parallel without interference obstacle detection system for autonomous vehicles. It has also been tested and validated in real situations autonomous vehicles driving at high speeds on real roads.

AB Based on the modeling of a micro autonomous underwater vehicle, an improved control structure and underlying control method are proposed for some parameters such as the automatic orientation, automatic depth, height, and speed of the micro autonomous underwater vehicle. A cascade double closed-loop control structure is proposed to control the horizontal plane by controlling properties such as the automatic depth, height, positioning, the response speed and adjustment precision of the control are improved. The parameters of the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control method can be optimized by using particle swarm optimization (PSO), and the fuzzy controller is designed to compare with the PID control of the autonomous underwater vehicles. Compared with the traditional PID control, the control effect of PSO-PID controller is stronger than that of the tranditional PID controller. Due to the uncertainty of the micro autonomous underwater vehicle mathematical model, the position control of PID controller is weaker than the fuzzy controller. The simulation results show that the proposed method has fast dynamic response and acceptable robustness.

AB This paper presents the development process of a robust and ROS-based Drive-By-Wire system designed for an autonomous electric vehicle from scratch over an open source chassis. A revision of the vehicle characteristics and the different modules of our navigation architecture is carried out to put in context our Drive-by-Wire system. The system is composed of a Steer-By-Wire module and a Throttle-By-Wire module that allow driving the vehicle by using some commands of lineal speed and curvature, which are sent through a local network from the control unit of the vehicle. Additionally, a Manual/Automatic switching system has been implemented, which allows the driver to activate the autonomous driving and safely taking control of the vehicle at any time. Finally, some validation tests were performed for our Drive-By-Wire system, as a part of our whole autonomous navigation architecture, showing the good working of our proposal. The results prove that the Drive-By-Wire system has the behaviour and necessary requirements to automate an electric vehicle. In addition, after 812 h of testing, it was proven that it is a robust Drive-By-Wire system, with high reliability. The developed system is the basis for the validation and implementation of new autonomous navigation techniques developed within the group in a real vehicle.

AB Current technological developments allow the testing of shared autonomous electric vehicles in real-life conditions. Consequently, we can evaluate how users react and if these developments might lead to more sustainable transport behaviour in the future. The purpose of this study was to capture public opinion regarding autonomous vehicles in terms of user experience and intended future use. Autonomous shuttles were operated in the Brussels Capital Region in a mixed traffic situation, allowing interaction with other road users. We compared the results of two pilots with different target groups in the same city. Public opinion was captured through an online survey after passengers had experienced a ride. Our results showed that more than 70% of the passengers expressed no concerns with regards to autonomous vehicles. The majority had a positive experience with the shuttle and evaluated the shuttle positively in terms of driving behaviour, entry and exit and comfort. The regression analysis indicated that enjoyment of the ride is an important factor that contributes to the intention to use autonomous shuttles in the future.

AB This article presents the robust lateral control of an autonomous vehicle in the presence of unknown lateral tire forces, road curvature angle, and parametric uncertainties. The sliding mode control (SMC) with barrier Lyapunov function is implemented to guarantee the system robustness while maintaining the outputs of the system in realistic bounds. Following the model reduction approach, the slow and fast dynamics of the system are separately controlled using the proposed control technique. The efficacy of the proposed control technique is examined by comparing the simulation results with conventional sliding mode control in two-time scales.

AB This paper proposes a map-based localization system for autonomous vehicle self-localization in urban environments, which is composed of a pose graph mapping method and 3D curvature feature points - Monte Carlo Localization algorithm (3DCF-MCL). The advantage of 3DCF-MCL is that it combines the high accuracy of the 3D feature points registration and the robustness of particle filter. Experimental results show that 3DCF-MCL can provide an accurate localization for autonomous vehicles with the 3D point cloud map that generated by our mapping method. Compared with other map-based localization algorithms, it demonstrates that 3DCF-MCL outperforms them.

AB This paper presents two Fault Tolerant schemes for more reliable spacing control of an autonomous vehicle. The nonlinear longitudinal model of the vehicle is described by the Lipschitz representation. Based upon this representation, a state feedback integral controller is designed, as well as, fault estimation observers. This proposal work is focused on Lyapunov theory ensuring H-infinity criterion and L-2-gain norm in the development of the Linear Matrix Inequality constraints. The design also includes an estimation of vehicle states and an additive fault with the purpose of achieving highly robust and safe vehicle inter-distance control. To carry out this work, experiments are highlighted on prototype vehicle to validate the proposed FTC scheme in different autonomous driving scenarios.

AB This paper is concerned with the tele-operation of autonomous vehicles over analog Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel, which is subject to transmission noise and power constraint. The nonlinear dynamic of autonomous vehicles is described by the unicycle model and is cascaded with a bandpass filter acting as encoder. Using the describing function method, the nonlinear dynamic of autonomous vehicles is represented by an approximate linear system. Then, the available results for linear control over analog AWGN channel are extended to account for linear continuous time systems with non-real valued and multiple real valued eigenvalues and for tracking a non-zero reference signal. Subsequently, by applying the extended results on the describing function of autonomous vehicles, a mean square control technique including an encoder, a decoder, and a controller is presented for reference tracking of the tele-operation of autonomous vehicles over AWGN channel. The satisfactory performance of the proposed control technique is illustrated by computer simulations. (C) 2021 Sharif University of Technology. All rights reserved.

AB Autonomous vehicles create new opportunities for innovative intelligent traffic systems. Variable speed limit (VSL), which is a speed management system that can adjust the speed limit according to traffic conditions or a predefined speed control algorithm on different road segments, can be better implemented with the cooperation of autonomous vehicles. These compliant vehicles can automatically follow speed limits. However, noncompliant vehicles will attempt to pass the moving bottleneck created by compliant vehicles. This study builds a multiclass cell-transmission model (CTM) to represent the relation among traffic flow parameters. This model calculates flows of both compliant and noncompliant vehicles between road segments. An VSL algorithm is proposed to reduce the stop-and-go behavior of vehicles at traffic signals and to save energy consumption. Simulation is used to test the effects of VSLs on an example network. The result shows that VSLs are effective at reducing the energy consumption of the whole system.

AB This study investigates the impacts of the sharing economy and vehicle automation on household vehicle ownership by considering the earning potential of household vehicles. While many studies have examined the impact of the sharing economy (namely ridesourcing) on vehicle ownership of ridesourcing customers, there is a gap in understanding its impact on vehicle ownership among ridesourcing suppliers. Data from an original survey are used to develop discrete choice models that evaluate the effects of earning potential, automation, and shared autonomous vehicle services on vehicle transaction decisions. The estimated models are applied to perform national-level simulations. It is found that, in comparison to a non-sharing economy context, individuals in the sharing economy tend to purchase more vehicles in times of income gain, and to preserve their fleets more readily in times of income loss. This study provides evidence that the sharing economy incentivizes some individuals to own more - not fewer - vehicles..

AB Autonomous vehicles create new opportunities as well as new challenges to dynamic vehicle routing. The introduction of autonomous vehicles as information-collecting agents results in scenarios, where dynamic nodes are found by proximity. This paper presents a novel dynamic vehicle-routing problem variant with proximity-dependent nodes. Here, we introduced a novel variable, detectability, which determines whether a proximal dynamic node will be detected, based on the sight radius of the vehicle. The problem considered is motivated by autonomous weed-spraying vehicles in large agricultural operations. This work is generalisable to many other autonomous vehicle applications. The first step to crafting a solution approach for the problem is to decide when reoptimisation should be triggered. Two reoptimisation trigger strategies are considered-exogenous and endogenous. Computational experiments compared the strategies for both the classical dynamic vehicle routing problem as well as the introduced variant. Experiments used extensive standardised vehicle-routing problem benchmarks with varying degrees of dynamism and geographical node distributions. The results showed that for both the classical problem and the novel variant, an endogenous trigger strategy is better in most cases, while an exogenous trigger strategy is only suitable when both detectability and dynamism are low. Furthermore, the optimal level of detectability was shown to be dependent on the combination of trigger, degree of dynamism, and geographical node distribution, meaning practitioners may determine the required detectability based on the attributes of their specific problem.

AB This study investigates the dynamics of traffic containing human-driven vehicles along with a fraction of self-organized artificial intelligence (AI) autonomous vehicles (AVs) on multilane freeways. We propose guidelines for the development of AI agents, such that a small fraction of AVs forms local constellations that significantly accelerate the entire traffic flow while reducing fuel consumption and increasing safety. Specifically, we report a 40% enhancement in traffic flow efficiency and up to a 28% reduction in fuel consumption even when only 5% of vehicles are autonomous. This scenario does not require changes to current infrastructure or communication between vehicles; it only requires proper regulations. The results indicate that more efficient, safer, faster, and greener traffic flow can be realized in the near future.

AB The automotive industry is currently experiencing a revolution with the advent and deployment of autonomous vehicles. Several countries are conducting large-scale testing of autonomous vehicles on private and even public roads. It is important to examine the attitudes and potential concerns of end users towards autonomous cars before mass deployment. To facilitate the transition to autonomous vehicles, the automotive industry produces many videos on its products and technologies. The largest video sharing website, YouTube.com, hosts many videos on autonomous vehicle technology. Content analysis and text mining of the comments related to the videos with large numbers of views can provide insight about potential end-user feedback. This study examines two questions: first, how do people view autonomous vehicles? Second, what polarities exist regarding (a) content and (b) automation level? The researchers found 107 videos on YouTube using a related keyword search and examined comments on the 15 most-viewed videos, which had a total of 60.9 million views and around 25,000 comments. The videos were manually clustered based on their content and automation level. This study used two natural language processing (NLP) tools to perform knowledge discovery from a bag of approximately seven million words. The key issues in the comment threads were mostly associated with efficiency, performance, trust, comfort, and safety. The perception of safety and risk increased in the textual contents when videos presented full automation level. Sentiment analysis shows mixed sentiments towards autonomous vehicle technologies, however, the positive sentiments were higher than the negative.

AB Safety is the cornerstone of autonomous driving vehicles. For autonomously controlled vehicles driving safely in complex and dynamic traffic scenarios, it is essential to precisely predict the evolution of the current traffic situation in the near future and make an accurate situational risk assessment. The precise motion prediction of surrounding vehicles is an essential prerequisite for risk assessment and motion planning of autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose a risk assessment and motion planning method for autonomously controlled vehicles based on motion prediction of surrounding vehicles. Firstly, surrounding vehicles' trajectories are predicted based on fusing constant turn rate and acceleration-based motion prediction model and maneuver-based motion prediction model with interactive multiple models. Then, considering both the probability of collision event and collision severity, the collision risk assessment between autonomously controlled vehicle and surrounding vehicles is conducted with a collision risk index. After that, the motion planning of the autonomously controlled vehicle is formulated as a multi-objectives and multi-constraints optimization problem with a model predictive control framework. Finally, the proposed method is applied to several traffic scenarios to validate its feasibility and effectiveness.

AB Although autonomous vehicles have introduced a promising potential for improving traffic safety and efficiency, ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles in complex road traffic environments is still a huge challenge to be tackled. To quickly quantify the potential risk factors of autonomous vehicles in traffic environments, this paper focuses mainly on the influence of the depth and breadth of the environment elements on the autonomous driving system, uses the potential field theory to establish a model of the impact of the environmental elements on the autonomous driving system, and combines AHP to quantify equivalent virtual electric quantity of each environment element, so as to realize the quantitative evaluation of the traffic environment complexity. The proposed method comprehensively considers the physical attributes and state parameters of the environmental elements, which compensates for the fact that the shortage of the factors considered in the traffic environment complexity assessment is not comprehensive. Finally, a series of experiments was carried out to verify the reliability of our proposed method. The results show that the complexity of the static elements is determined only by the physical attributes and shape of the obstacle; the complexity of the dynamic elements is determined by the movement of the obstacle and the movement of the autonomous vehicle, and the comprehensive complexity mainly depends on the complexity of their dynamic elements. Compared with other methods, the complexity evaluation values are generally consistent, the absolute percentage error of the majority of samples was within +/- 5%, and the degree of deviation was -1.143%, which provides theoretical support for autonomous vehicles on safety and the risk assessment in future.

AB Radar and LiDAR are two environmental sensors commonly used in autonomous vehicles, Lidars are accurate in determining objects' positions but significantly less accurate as Radars on measuring their velocities. However, Radars relative to Lidars are more accurate on measuring objects velocities but less accurate on determining their positions as they have a lower spatial resolution. In order to compensate for the low detection accuracy, incomplete target attributes and poor environmental adaptability of single sensors such as Radar and LiDAR, in this paper, an effective method for high-precision detection and tracking of surrounding targets of autonomous vehicles. By employing the Unscented Kalman Filter, Radar and LiDAR information is effectively fused to achieve high-precision detection of the position and speed information of targets around the autonomous vehicle. Finally, the real vehicle test under various driving environment scenarios is carried out. The experimental results show that the proposed sensor fusion method can effectively detect and track the vehicle peripheral targets with high accuracy. Compared with a single sensor, it has obvious advantages and can improve the intelligence level of autonomous cars.

Using vehicle kinematics, a reference frame is generated which provides desired orientation of the vehicle along the path. An error space is then defined using the reference trajectory and thereby linearized. Based on this linearized model, a static output feedback controller is designed and implemented on the nonlinear plant. Computer simulations have been used to verify the controller design.

AB The expansion of electric vehicles in urban areas has paved the way toward the era of autonomous vehicles, improving the performance in smart cities and upgrading related driving problems. This field of research opens immediate applications in the tourism areas, airports or business centres by greatly improving transport efficiency and reducing repetitive human tasks. This project shows the problems derived from autonomous driving such as vehicle localization, low coverage of 4G/5G and GPS, detection of the road and navigable zones including intersections, detection of static and dynamic obstacles, longitudinal and lateral control and cybersecurity aspects. The approaches proposed in this article are sufficient to solve the operational design of the problems related to autonomous vehicle application in the special locations such as rough environment, high slopes and unstructured terrain without traffic rules.

AB The growth in technology on autonomous transportation systems is currently motivating a number of research initiatives. This paper first presents a survey of the literature on autonomous marine vessels in general. By identifying the main research interests in this field, we define 10 thematic categories. The collected articles are then classified according to these categories. We show that research on autonomous vessels has increased dramatically in the past decade. However, most of the published articles have focused on navigation control and safety issues. Studies regarding other topics, such as transport and logistics, are very limited. Although our main interest is the literature on autonomous vessels, we contrast its development with respect to the literature on autonomous cars so as to have a better understanding about the future potentials in the research on autonomous vessels. The comparison shows that there are great opportunities for research about transportation and logistics with autonomous vessels. Finally, several potential research areas regarding logistics with autonomous vessels are proposed. As the technology behind remote-controlled or autonomous ships is maturing rapidly, we believe that it is already time for researchers in the field to start looking into future water-borne transport and logistics using autonomous vessels.

AB Detecting and tracking moving vehicles is one of the most fundamental functions of autonomous vehicles driving in complex scenarios, as it forms the foundation of decision making and path planning. In order to estimate the pose information of moving vehicles accurately, 3D-LiDAR is widely used for accurate distance data. This paper proposed a real-time tracking algorithm based on L-Shape fitting. The algorithm detects the corners of moving vehicles and uses RANSAC to take a limited amount of noisy data. In addition, a vehicle tracking system with multi-weight Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filtering (RBPF) is built upon the orientation estimation given by L-Shape fitting. The proposed algorithm is validated on the KITTI dataset and a manually labeled dataset acquired from an autonomous vehicle at Carnegie Mellon University. Furthermore, the proposed solution is implemented in an autonomous vehicle at Tongji University. The experiments illustrate that the proposed algorithm achieves real-time performance, mitigates the effect of noisy data and improves estimation accuracy.

AB Many vehicle platoons are interrupted while traveling on roads, especially at urban signalized intersections. One reason for such interruptions is the inability to exchange real-time information between traditional human-driven vehicles and intersection infrastructure. Thus, this paper develops a Markov chain-based model to recognize platoons. A simulation experiment is performed in Vissim based on field data extracted from video recordings to prove the model's applicability. The videos, recorded with a high-definition camera, contain field driving data from three Tesla vehicles, which can achieve Level 2 autonomous driving. The simulation results show that the recognition rate exceeds 80% when the connected and autonomous vehicle penetration rate is higher than 0.7. Whether a vehicle is upstream or downstream of an intersection also affects the performance of platoon recognition. The platoon recognition model developed in this paper can be used as a signal control input at intersections to reduce the unnecessary interruption of vehicle platoons and improve traffic efficiency.

AB The demand for autonomous electric public transport is increasing globally. New vehicle models and variants are increasing the development complexity and hence the overall development time. Therefore, there is a requirement for a vehicle-packaging tool that can translate user inputs into an optimised vehicle package and can be visualised instantly. The aim of this paper is to develop a parametric tool for designing different concepts for electric autonomous buses. The scope of application is intended in the early phase of the vehicle development process to enable a fast and efficient creation of a flexible bus concept. Through a graphical user interface (GUI), the user is able to size and select all the required components for the autonomous vehicle concepts. The vehicle specification is initiated by selection of one of the three classes of vehicle, the desired number of passengers and then the bus interior's seat arrangement design. An appropriate powertrain and chassis will then automatically be configured in the next steps. The HVAC simulation allows for the design of different components of the refrigeration circuit to ensure proper cabin temperature. For evaluating the concept, the energy consumption is analysed through simulations, and an estimated initial cost of vehicle concepts and individual systems completes the concept. A spider chart summarises all characteristics and offers an overview of the vehicle concept, providing the possibility to compare with other concepts simultaneously. The tool can create 9600 different bus concepts and provides interfaces for expansion.

AB In emergency situations, autonomous vehicles will be forced to operate at their friction limits in order to avoid collisions. In these scenarios, coordinating the planning of the vehicle's path and speed gives the vehicle the best chance of avoiding an obstacle. Fast reaction time is also important in an emergency, but approaches to the trajectory planning problem based on nonlinear optimization are computationally expensive. This paper presents a new scheme that simultaneously modifies the desired path and speed profile for a vehicle in response to the appearance of an obstacle, significant tracking error, or other environmental change. By formulating the trajectory optimization problem as a quadratically constrained quadratic program, solution times of less than 20 ms are possible even with a 10-s planning horizon. A simplified point mass model is used to describe the vehicle's motion, but the incorporation of longitudinal weight transfer and road topography means that the vehicle's acceleration limits are modeled more accurately than in comparable approaches. Experimental data from an autonomous vehicle in two scenarios demonstrate how the trajectory planner enables the vehicle to avoid an obstacle even when the obstacle appears suddenly and the vehicle is already operating near the friction limits.

AB With the rapid development of autonomous driving technology, collision avoidance has become a research hotspot since it has the potential to increase safety. To obtain a collision-free path, the artificial potential field (APF) is widely used as a path planning method. APF is capable of establishing functional relationships between the vehicle and surrounding objects. However, the function features of the traditional APF method can cause autonomous vehicles to fall into the local minimum, and the generated zigzag path may be difficult to follow. Motivated by these challenges, this paper proposes a real-time path planning method for autonomous vehicles using the dynamic enhanced firework algorithm-APF. Firstly, to improve the safety and smoothness of the planned path by the traditional APF method, the constraints of the vehicle dynamics and different types of obstacles are taken into consideration. Secondly, an optimization problem is formulated to find an optimal path with the least cost in the driving area. Finally, the proposed method is verified with both a simulation and a hardware-in-loop test environment. The results show that the studied autonomous vehicle successfully avoids obstacles and arrives at the goal position by using the proposed path-planning method, and the path smoothness is improved.

AB Efficient trajectory tracking approaches can enable autonomous vehicles not only to get a smooth trajectory but to achieve a lower energy dissipation. Since vehicle model plays an important role in trajectory tracking, this paper investigates and compares the performance of two classical vehicle models for trajectory tracking of autonomous vehicles using model predictive control (MPC). Firstly, a two-degree-of-freedom kinematic model and a three-degree-of-freedom yaw dynamic model are established for autonomous vehicles. Meanwhile, in order to carry out tracking control more effectively and smoothly, the tire slip angle has been taken into account by the dynamic model. Then, we design two MPC controllers for trajectory tracking, which are based on the kinematic model and the dynamic model, respectively. The performances of two MPC controllers are evaluated and compared on the Carsim/Matlab joint simulation platform. Experimental results demonstrated that, under low speed working conditions, both two MPC controllers can follow the reference trajectory with high accuracy and stability. However, under high speed working conditions, the tracking error of the kinematic model is too large to be used in the real trajectory tracking problem. On the contrary, the controller based on the dynamic model still performs a good tracking effect. In addition, this study offers a guidance on how to select a suitable vehicle model for autonomous vehicles under different speed working conditions.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) will open the future to vast possibilities in transportation, most of which have yet to be imagined. As these new technologies emerge, they also have the potential to render many of today's most common transportation control methods irrelevant. In this paper, concepts of connected and autonomous are applied to coordinate and synchronize the arrival and departure of vehicles at intersections; effectively ending the need for traffic signals. Under a set of "autonomous rules of operation", vehicles can be kept in near-continuous motion while also maintaining safe separation, creating a system of "virtual traffic signal" (VTS). Assessments of these rules shows that delay and stopping reductions of more than 50 to 97 percent will be possible over actuated control and fixed time signal control - and without the risk of collisions. Not will these rules reduce congestion, travel time, and prevent crashes; they will also lower fuel consumption and exhaust emissions.

AB The use of real-time software-controlled reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) units is proposed to increase the reliability of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. The optimum placement problem of the RIS units is formulated by considering their sizes and operating modes. The solution of the problem is given, where it is shown that the optimal placement of the RIS depends on the locations of the transmitter and the receiver. The proposed RIS-supported highway deployment can combat the high path loss experienced by the use of higher frequency bands, including the millimeter-wave and the terahertz bands, that are expected to be used in the next-generation wireless networks. By using the proposed RIS-powered architecture the existing base station deployment plans can remain operational while providing reliable and energy-efficient connectivity for autonomous vehicles.

AB In the hope of expanding underwater observation and research, the Institute of Industrial Science (IIS) at the University of Tokyo started extensive R&D on autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in 1984. IIS has constructed nine vehicles, including three ocean-going vehicles, one lake survey vehicle and various testbed vehicles. The R-One Robot is equipped with a closed-cycle diesel engine system and it successfully completed a 12-h operation of long-range autonomous diving in the Pacific Ocean in 1998. Utilizing the testbed robots, many intelligent systems, especially those for underwater vision systems, have been developed. The success of these AUVs at the IIS has led to the establishment of the 'Underwater Technology Research Center' which opened on 1 April 1999. This new center also plans to collaborate both nationally and internationally with other facilities for further R&D of AUVs and other new underwater observation technologies.

ID VEHICLES; MOBILITY
AB Passenger vehicles are a major source of air pollution, exposure to which increases respiratory disease risk, amplifies life-threatening conditions and burdens the public purse. The negative externalities associated with these vehicles rise further when road accidents are considered. Almost all such accidents involving fatalities transpire when private users are in single vehicle incidents or collide with each other. Though autonomous vehicle technology can mitigate these effects, widespread adoption and proliferation demands cost competitiveness with the status quo; namely, personally owned and operated, conventional vehicles. Here we show that this prospect may - in a commercially owned and operated enterprise - be unlikely. Causal factors of relevance include low capacity utilization rates and impracticable profit expectations. In a single ridership 'autonomous taxi' model, we find capacity utilization rates would need to improve from 52 percent to 100 percent and profits lowered by 37 percent (from 27 cents to 17 cents on a per-mile basis) for autonomous taxis to offer fares that are comparable with personally owned, conventional vehicles. In a multiple ridership model, the affordance of these fares requires a 30 percent increase in vehicle occupancy (from 1.67 to 2.2) and a 75 percent increase (1.67 to 2.92) were even lower fares offered to incentivize shared, autonomous taxi use over personally owned, conventional vehicles. We conclude that consideration of the opportunity costs of driving are integral to the widespread adoption of a technology that may dramatically improve public health outcomes.

AB To resolve the path tracking problem of autonomous ground vehicles, an analysis of existing path tracking methods was carried out and an important conclusion was got. The vehicle-road model is crucial for path following. Based on the conclusion, a new vehicle-road model named "ribbon model" was constructed with consideration of road width and vehicle geometry structure. A new vehicle-road evaluation algorithm was proposed based on this model, and a new path tracking controller including a steering controller and a speed controller was designed. The difficulties of preview distance selection and parameters tuning with speed in the pure following controller are avoided in this controller. To verify the performance of the novel method, simulation and real vehicle experiments were carried out. Experimental results show that the path tracking controller can keep the vehicle in the road running as fast as possible, so it can adjust the control strategy, such as safety, amenity, and rapidity criteria autonomously according to the road situation. This is important for the controller to adapt to different kinds of environments, and can improve the performance of autonomous ground vehicles significantly.

AB Advances in V2V, V2I, and autonomous vehicle technologies have made autonomous buses possible in cities. Soon, autonomous bus operations will be common in urban areas, which will improve sustainability, safety, and the city's technology. These buses have different operation types. Each operation has advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, the goal of this study is to serve as a guide for decision-makers during the transition to autonomous buses. Four alternatives are evaluated based on eleven criteria organized under four main aspects, namely autonomous buses for special uses, autonomous buses for last-mile uses, autonomous cars in mixed traffic, and autonomous buses in closed systems. We propose an Ordinal Priority Approach (OPA) method for determining the criteria weights and application of fuzzy Dombi Bonferroni (DOBI) methodology for the evaluation of alternatives. When compared to the other three alternatives in this study, the results show that deploying autonomous buses in mixed traffic is the most advantageous option.

AB In the research of autonomous vehicles, most existing studies treat the decision/planning and control as two separate problems. This idea originates from robotics. But since there are essential differences between robot and autonomous vehicle, the structure in Robotics may not be suitable for autonomous vehicles. Considering decision/planning and control separately may affect the performance of autonomous vehicle under complex driving conditions. To fill in the research gap, this paper proposes a novel scheme which considers the local motion planning and control in a combined manner. Firstly, the local motion planning is transformed into the longitudinal control problem based on the proposed scenario adaptive MPC, by which the motion behavior (driving along the global path, car-following, lane-change) can be automatically decided. Then, the lateral MPC controller is designed to track the global path and conduct the local motion commands. To ensure the performance of the path tracking control and a smooth lane-change process simultaneously, an adaptive weight mechanism is introduced in the lateral controller. Comprehensive case studies including both straight and curve road are conducted based on Carsim-Simulink co-simulation platform. The results show that the proposed algorithm can not only ensure the vehicle safety in complex driving conditions, but also ensure that the vehicle can drive at its desired velocity as much as possible by intelligently judging the most proper motion behaviors.

AB Autonomous vehicles in highway driving scenarios are expected to become a reality in the next few years. Decision-making and motion planning algorithms, which allow autonomous vehicles to predict and tackle unpredictable road traffic situations, play a crucial role. Indeed, finding the optimal driving decision in all the different driving scenarios is a challenging task due to the large and complex variability of highway traffic scenarios. In this context, the aim of this work is to design an effective hybrid two-layer path planning architecture that, by exploiting the powerful tools offered by the emerging Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in combination with model-based approaches, lets the autonomous vehicles properly behave in different highway traffic conditions and, accordingly, to determine the lateral and longitudinal control commands. Specifically, the DRL-based high-level planner is responsible for training the vehicle to choose tactical behaviors according to the surrounding environment, while the low-level control converts these choices into the lateral and longitudinal vehicle control actions to be imposed through an optimization problem based on Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) approach, thus enforcing continuous constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical architecture is hence evaluated via an integrated vehicular platform that combines the MATLAB environment with the SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) traffic simulator. The exhaustive simulation analysis, carried out on different non-trivial highway traffic scenarios, confirms the capability of the proposed strategy in driving the autonomous vehicles in different traffic scenarios.

AB The use of autonomous systems at wood processing sites of forest industries can significantly increase safety, productivity and efficiency by reducing the number of monotonous and dangerous tasks conducted by human labor utilizing heavy machinery. However, autonomous machine operation in mill yards is challenging because of the dynamic and complex working environment and partly unstructured processes. The inherent complexity of wood handling and storage tasks requires significant human expertise. Rapid advancements in sensor technologies and machine learning techniques, along with increases in available computational power have enabled progress in automated operation frameworks and algorithms development, which opens the door to the introduction of novel autonomous systems into this environment. With the aim of gaining a better understanding of current issues and facilitating optimal strategies for the deployment of high-level autonomous systems in mill yard environments, this study: (1) utilizes a systematic literature review to map current autonomous technologies and algorithms suitable for adoption by the forest industry in automation of vehicles working in mill yards; (2) summarizes and discusses the potential feasibility of the considered sensors, systems and adoption strategies, and considers implementation challenges for high-level autonomous machinery in mill yard environments; and (3) proposes a system framework that integrates multiple technologies to enable autonomous navigation and material handling in mill yards. The study is the first of its kind as a comprehensive study on autonomous vehicles and machinery in mill yard environments. Our novel framework aids in the identification of follow-up research areas and thus promotes the adoption and use of complex autonomous systems in industrial environments.

AB Coordination of Active Front Steering (AFS) and Direct Yaw Moment Control (DYC) has been widely used for non-autonomous vehicle lateral stability control. Recently, some researchers used it (AFS/DYC) for path-following of autonomous vehicles. However, current controllers are not robust enough with respect to uncertainties and different road conditions to guarantee lateral stability of Autonomous Four In-wheel Motor Drive Electric Vehicles. Thus, a coordinated control is proposed to address this issue. In this paper, a two-layer hierarchical control strategy is utilized. In the upper-layer, a self-tunable super-twisting sliding mode control is utilized to deal with parametric uncertainties, and a Model Predictive Control (MPC) is used in order to allocate the control action to each AFS and DYC. Parametric uncertainties of tires' cornering stiffness, vehicle mass and moment of inertia are considered. Simulations with different road conditions for path-following scenario have been conducted in MATLAB/Simulink. An autonomous vehicle equipped with Four In-wheel Motor and two degrees of freedom vehicle dynamics model is used in this study. In the end, the performance of the proposed controller is compared with the MPC controller. Simulation results reveal that the proposed controller provides better path-following in comparison with the MPC controller.

AB Autonomous driving systems are becoming increasingly feasible and highly expected to be the heart of intelligent transportation systems. To deploy the autonomous driving vehicles on public roads, one of the practical challenges might be safe cooperation and collaboration among multiple vehicles, in particular when conflicts arise on shared road segments, such as road intersections, merge points, construction zones, single-track lanes, and center turn lane. In the current traffic systems, human drivers navigate these regions using a combination of traffic rules, social norms, courtesy, hand signals, and common sense. In this paper, we identify and classify such Dynamic Intersections that might lead to vehicle accidents and/or deadlocks and that might appear almost anytime and anywhere on public roads. In addition, we present a cooperative dynamic intersection protocol that uses on-board perception systems and vehicular communications for peer-to-peer negotiation. Under our protocol, autonomous driving vehicles can create a vehicular communication-based traffic manager named Cyber Traffic Light when congestion arises. Cyber Traffic Light works as a self-organizing, self-planning, and self-optimizing traffic manager, and it allocates the green period for vehicles coming from the multiple directions. Finally, we showed that our decentralized protocol has much higher traffic throughput, compared to two simple protocols while guaranteeing road safety.

AB Objective: Autonomous driving technology eliminates human errors, and thus it is a promising solution for reducing road traffic fatalities and injuries. While future autonomous driving technology may be able to reduce the number of collision accidents, it will not be able to avoid all collision accidents. This study is aimed to demonstrate why some accidents will still be unavoidable even with advanced perceiving and controlling capabilities.Methods: Because fully autonomous vehicles are currently in the laboratory stage, we used the prospective method to study the unavoidable accident of autonomous vehicles. Suitable traffic accident cases were screened from the China In-Depth Accident Study (CIDAS). Videos of the accidents were analyzed and the accidents were reconstructed using PC-Crash software. We assumed that target vehicle possesses near-perfect autonomous driving capabilities. Unavoidable accidents were determined based on vehicle dynamics and traffic constraints. The time from perceiving hazard to collision was calculated for each accident.Results: Among the 112 accidents screened, 15 cases of unavoidable accidents were identified. Three typical cases are presented in detail in this study. Based on the reasons why the target vehicles cannot avoid the collisions, we classified the unavoidable accidents into time-limit type and space-limit type. Time-limit means that vehicle cannot stop or steer out of danger in time, and space-limit means that the traffic environment does not have sufficient space for vehicle to avoid collision.Conclusions: Collision accidents will still occur even with perfect autonomous driving technology. We used the prospective method to investigate scenarios and characteristics of unavoidable accidents of autonomous vehicles. The time-limit type and the space-limit type were identified as two categories of unavoidable accidents. For the time-limit unavoidable accidents, the time from perceiving hazard to collision is typically not longer than 1.5s. The characteristics of unavoidable accidents and the estimated pre-crash warning time can provide some reference for establishing future occupant protection strategies. This study also showed the limitations of active safety and the necessity of passive safety.

AB The concern over safety features in autonomous vehicles is increasing due to the rapid development and increasing use of autonomous driving technology. The safety evaluations performed for an autonomous driving system cannot depend only on existing safety verification methods, due to the lack of scenario reproducibility and the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle. Vehicle-In-the-Loop Simulation (VILS) utilizes both real vehicles and virtual simulations for the driving environment to overcome these drawbacks and is a suitable candidate for ensuring reproducibility. However, there may be differences between the behavior of the vehicle in the VILS and vehicle tests due to the implementation level of the virtual environment. This study proposes a novel VILS system that displays consistency with the vehicle tests. The proposed VILS system comprises virtual road generation, synchronization, virtual traffic manager generation, and perception sensor modeling, and implements a virtual driving environment similar to the vehicle test environment. Additionally, the effectiveness of the proposed VILS system and its consistency with the vehicle test is demonstrated using various verification methods. The proposed VILS system can be applied to various speeds, road types, and surrounding environments.

AB Automated vehicle developers in California are required to submit records of crashes and distances traveled in autonomous mode for all vehicles in their fleets. Several studies have investigated this database to compare automated vehicle crash rates with national rates. Although automated vehicles are struck from behind in 73 % of their autonomous mode crashes, this is the first study to compare automated vehicle struck-from-behind crash rates to national rates using equivalent crash definitions. Rear-end collisions have substantial public health and economic impacts, representing a third of all collisions and $3.9 B in annual economic costs. In this study, automated vehicles in autonomous mode were found to be struck from behind at 4.8 times the rate of humandriven vehicles in a naturalistic driving study. When controlling for driving environment, the rates for AVs were 5.0 times higher for urban driving and not significant for business/industrial driving, although these results are for different manufacturers, complicating the results. Automated vehicles were more likely to be struck when stopped than when moving compared to human-driven vehicles, suggesting that automated vehicles? decisions about where and when to stop or remain stopped at intersections are more plausible contributing factors than unexpected rates of deceleration.

AB As autonomous driving technology develops, the advantages and disadvantages of autonomous vehicles emerge. In order for automated vehicles to find a place in society, public opinion and acceptance are important, and a number of studies about public opinion and acceptance are underway. In this paper, we investigated the relation between cross cultural differences and public opinion on automated vehicles. Through a literature review, public opinion in various countries, including China, India, Japan, the U.S., the U.K., and Australia, was collected. Through these data, the influence of cross cultural differences in public opinion was identified, and statistical models for predicting public opinion about autonomous vehicles were developed. In addition, the prediction models were validated through the results of the survey conducted in this paper. As a result, the influence of cross cultural differences on public opinion about automated vehicles was confirmed.

AB The purpose of this paper is to present a case study of the development, implementation and performance analysis of an autonomous flight control strategy for a 1-meter small-sized unmanned aerial vehicle. Firstly, a learning algorithm based open-loop control is,proposed by simulating a skilled human operator's manipulation of the aircraft. This is aimed to generate a set of command data inputs and investigate the multichannel control characteristics with the open-loop control. Secondly, a feedforward plus a proportional and derivative (PD) feedback control is employed to control the vehicle in following the command data to complete the loitering flight. The PD control gains are tuned automatically according to the attitude of the vehicle using the fuzzy logic theory. Thirdly, autonomous flight experiments conducted on a 1-meter small-sized aerial vehicle demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB As self-driving cars have been developed targeting level 4 and 5 autonomous driving, the capability of the vehicle to handle environmental effects has been considered importantly. The sensors installed on autonomous vehicles can be easily affected by blockages (e.g., rain, snow, dust, fog, and others) covering the surface of them. In a virtual environment, we can safely observe the behavior of the vehicle and the degradation of the sensors by blockages. In this letter, the CARLA simulator-based evaluation framework has been developed and the assessment of lane detection performance under sensor blockage by heavy rain, which was analyzed by using the experimental data. Thus, we thoroughly note that the accuracy of lane detection for the autonomous vehicle has been decreased as the rainfall rate increases, and the impact of the blockage is more critical to curved lanes than straight lanes. Finally, we have suggested a critical rainfall rate causing safety failures of the autonomous vehicles, based on reasonably established rainfall equation based on experimental rain datasets.

AB With the rapid advancement of autonomous vehicles, a transformative transportation paradigm is emerging in the automotive industry, necessitating a re-evaluation of how users engage with and utilize these evolving settings. This research paper introduces an innovative interaction system tailored for shared autonomous vehicles, focusing on its development and comprehensive evaluation. The proposed system uses the car's windshield as an interactive display surface, enabling infotainment and real-time information about the surrounding environment. The integration of two gesture-based interfaces forms a central component of the system. Through a study involving twenty subjects, we analyzed and compared the user experience facilitated by these interfaces. The study outcomes demonstrated that the subjects exhibited similar behaviors and responses across both interfaces, thus validating the potential of these interaction systems for future autonomous vehicles. These findings collectively emphasize the transformative nature of the proposed system and its ability to enhance user engagement and interaction within the context of autonomous transportation.

AB With the development of autonomous vehicle technology, human-centered transport research will likely shift to the interaction between humans and vehicles. This study focuses on the human trust variation in autonomous vehicles (AVs) as the technology becomes increasingly intelligent. This study uses electroencephalogram data to analyze human trust in AVs during simulated driving conditions. Two driving conditions, the semi-autonomous and the autonomous, which correspond to the two highest levels of automatic driving, are used for the simulation, accompanied by various driving and car conditions. The graph theoretical analysis (GTA) is the primary method for data analysis. In semi-autonomous driving mode, the local efficiency and cluster coefficient are lower in car-normal conditions than in car-malfunction conditions with the car approaching. This finding suggests that the human brain has a strong information processing ability while facing predictable potential hazards. However, when it comes to a traffic light with a car malfunctioning under the semi-autonomous driving mode, the characteristic path length is higher for the car malfunction manifesting a weak information processing ability while facing unpredictable potential hazards. Furthermore, in fully automatic driving conditions, participants cannot do anything and need low-level brain function to take emergency actions as lower local efficiency and small worldness for car malfunction. Our results shed light on the design of the human-machine interaction and human factor engineering on the high level of an autonomous vehicle.

AB With the maturation of autonomous driving technology, the use of autonomous vehicles in a socially acceptable manner has become a growing demand of the public. Human-like autonomous driving is expected due to the impact of the differences between autonomous vehicles and human drivers on safety. Although human-like decision-making has become a research hotspot, a unified theory has not yet been formed, and there are significant differences in the implementation and performance of existing methods. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of human-like decision-making for autonomous vehicles. The following issues are discussed: 1) The intelligence level of most autonomous driving decision-making algorithms; 2) The driving datasets and simulation platforms for testing and verifying human-like decision-making; 3) The evaluation metrics of human-likeness; personalized driving; the application of decision-making in real traffic scenarios; and 4) The potential research direction of human-like driving. These research results are significant for creating interpretable human-like driving models and applying them in dynamic traffic scenarios. In the future, the combination of intuitive logical reasoning and hierarchical structure will be an important topic for further research. It is expected to meet the needs of human-like driving.

AB To fully consider the impact of asphalt pavement rut on steering stability of autonomous vehicles, the sensitivity of various indicators of rut shape to vehicle stability was comprehensively measured, and pavement rut control standards based on comfort demands of autonomous vehicles were investigated. Firstly, a steering control system for autonomous vehicles was built in Simulink according to fuzzy control theory. Then, through orthogonal experiment design theory, different rut shape indicators are simulated in CarSim. The influence sensitivity of different rut shape indicators and the allowable rut range considering driving comfort were studied. The results show that both the rut depth and the rut side angle have a greater effect on the vehicle vertical acceleration within a certain parameter range. The maximum roll angle of vehicle body is mainly affected by the rut depth, and the rut width has a small effect on the vehicle driving stability. Meanwhile, considering human comfort, the rut side angle should not be greater than 1 degrees when the rut depth reaches 2cm. For autonomous driving, the rut depth should not exceed 2.5cm. When the rut depth exceeds 2.5cm, the vehicle body roll angle caused by the rut exceeds the inertial centrifugal force of the vehicle itself, which has a significant impact on the passenger comfort and safety.

AB Autonomous vehicles are equipped with multiple heterogeneous sensors and drive while processing data from each sensor in real time. Among the sensors, the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is essential to the localization of the vehicle itself. However, if a GNSS-denied situation occurs while driving, the accident risk may be high due to the degradation of the vehicle positioning performance. This paper presents a cooperative positioning technique based on the lidar sensor and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. The ego-vehicle continuously tracks surrounding vehicles and objects, and localizes itself using tracking information from the surroundings, especially in GNSS-denied situations. We present the effectiveness of the cooperative positioning technique by constructing a GNSS-denied case during autonomous driving.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are becoming increasingly widespread in today's industrialised world, with research shifting towards cooperative control between multiple vehicles. Cooperative control between AUVs poses a number of challenges such as collision-avoidance, path-planning and group formation. This paper presents a novel 3D technique for the purposes of inspecting underwater structures using autonomous vehicles. Vehicles are navigated using a combination of traditional artificial potential fields (APFs) and rotational potential fields (RPFs) which are employed using 2D sub-planes in a concertina effect to provide full boundary coverage and inspection of submerged architectures. Vehicles are freed from the usual angular constraints associated with group strategies whilst moving in a fluid formation, reducing computational load. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the technique on two different-sized structures, providing varying customised levels of inspection and successful collision-free journeys throughout with minimal path length.

AB The way we drive, and the transport of today are going through radical changes. Intelligent mobility envisions to improve the efficiency of traditional transportation through advanced digital technologies, such as robotics, artificial intelligence and Internet of Things. Central to the development of intelligent mobility technology is the emergence of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) where vehicles are capable of navigating environments autonomously. For this to be achieved, autonomous vehicles must be safe, trusted by passengers, and other drivers. However, it is practically impossible to train autonomous vehicles with all the possible traffic conditions that they may encounter. The work in this paper presents an alternative solution of using infrastructure to aid CAVs to learn driving policies, specifically for complex junctions, which require local experience and knowledge to handle. The proposal is to learn safe driving policies through data-driven imitation learning of human-driven vehicles at a junction utilizing data captured from surveillance devices about vehicle movements at the junction. The proposed framework is demonstrated by processing video datasets captured from uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) from three intersections around Europe which contain vehicle trajectories. An imitation learning algorithm based on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is proposed to learn and predict safe trajectories of vehicles. The proposed framework can be used for many purposes in intelligent mobility, such as augmenting the intelligent control algorithms in driverless vehicles, benchmarking driver behavior for insurance purposes, and for providing insights to city planning.

AB On-demand ride-pooling systems have gained increasing attention in science and practice in recent years. Simulation studies have shown an enormous potential to reduce fleet sizes and vehicle kilometers traveled if private car trips are replaced with ride-pooling services. However, existing simulation studies assume operation with autonomous vehicles, with no restrictions on operational tasks required when the vehicles are operated by manual drivers.In this article, we simulate and evaluate the operational challenges of non-autonomous ride -pooling systems through driver shifts and breaks and compare their capacity and efficiency to autonomous on-demand services. Based on the existing ride-pooling service MOIA in Hamburg, Germany, we introduce shift and break schedules and implement a new hub return logic to perform the respective tasks at different types of vehicle hubs. This way, currently operating on-demand services are modeled more realistically and the efficiency gains of such services through autonomous vehicles are quantified. The results suggest that operational challenges substantially limit the ride-pooling capacity in terms of served rides with a given number of vehicles. While results largely depend on the chosen shift plan, the presented operational factors should be considered for the assessment of current operational real-world services. The contribution of this study is threefold: From a technical perspective, it is shown that the explicit simulation of operational constraints of current services is crucial to assess ride-pooling services. From a policy perspective, the study shows the operational challenges of a ride-pooling service with non-autonomous vehicles and the potential of future autonomous services. Lastly, the paper adds to the literature a practical ride-pooling simulation use case based on observed real-world demand and shift data.

ID VISION
AB Deep learning has an impressive performance of object detection and classification for autonomous vehicles. Nevertheless, the essential vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial samples makes the autonomous vehicles suffer severe security and safety issues. Although a number of works have been proposed to study adversarial samples, only a few of them are designated for the scenario of autonomous vehicles. Moreover, the state-of-the-art attack models only focus on a single data source without considering the correlation among multiple data sources. To fill this blank, we propose two multi-source adversarial sample attack models, including the parallel attack model and the fusion attack model to simultaneously attack the image and LiDAR perception systems in the autonomous vehicles. In the parallel attack model, adversarial samples are generated from the original image and LiDAR data separately. In the fusion attack model, the adversarial samples of image and LiDAR can be generated from a low-dimension vector at the same time by fully exploring data correlation for data fusion and adversarial sample generation. Through comprehensive real-data experiments, we validate that our proposed models are more powerful and efficient to break down the perception systems of autonomous vehicles compared with the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we simulate possible attack scenarios in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) to evaluate the attack performance of our proposed methods.

ID SECURITY
AB Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) is a fundamental connected vehicle application that extends Adaptive Cruise Control by exploiting vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. CACC is a crucial ingredient for numerous autonomous vehicle functionalities including platooning, distributed route management, etc. Unfortunately, malicious V2V communications can subvert CACC, leading to string instability and road accidents. In this paper, we develop a novel resiliency infrastructure, RACCON, for detecting and mitigating V2V attacks on CACC. RACCON uses machine learning to develop an on-board prediction model that captures anomalous vehicular responses and performs mitigation in real time. RACCON-enabled vehicles can exploit the high efficiency of CACC without compromising safety, even under potentially adversarial scenarios. We present extensive experimental evaluation to demonstrate the efficacy of RACCON.

AB Autonomous vehicles have attracted more attention in recent years as vehicle applications are evolving to a more intelligent and autonomous stage. This paper presents the development of a collision avoidance system for an autonomous vehicle application which consists of a motion planner and model-predictive-control-based active vehicle steering and active wheel torque control. A motion planner, based on polynomial parameterization, determines a collision-free trajectory when a vehicle collision with obstacles is likely to happen. Then an MPC-based control system controls the front steering and individual wheel torques to track the desired collision-free reference trajectory. The proposed system is evaluated through simulation, using an eight-degrees-of-freedom vehicle model with a 'magic formula' tire model, active front steering, and active wheel torque distribution systems. The simulation results show that it effectively performs collision avoidance maneuvers.

DE Shared autonomous vehicles; taxis; agent-based model; mode choice
AB When autonomous vehicles (AVs) are fully functional, they will compete with existing mainstays in the transportation system. Sharing AVs can mitigate the inefficient use of privately-owned AVs (e.g., empty-vehicle miles), and to improve the productivity of AVs (i.e., less time parked than personal vehicles). Further, sharing AVs will enable people to travel without vehicle ownership costs and responsibilities. In this regard, taxi travelers will likely be the first users of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). This study investigates the trips made by taxi users in Chicago and develops an agent-based modeling framework to simulate a fleet of SAVs operating in the network, competing with human driver taxis. Results show that SAVs may attract more users than conventional taxis because of reduced driver-associated costs (driver not required in SAV services). The results provide insights to both private and public sectors who seek to implement SAVs to challenge or eventually replace existing taxis.

AB This article presents a visual navigation and landing control paradigm for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to land on a moving autonomous surface vehicle (ASV). Therein, an adaptive learning navigation rule with a multilayer nested guidance is designed to pinpoint the position of the ASV and to guide and control the UAV to fulfill horizontal tracking and vertical descending in a narrow landing region of the ASV by means of merely relative position feedback. To ensure the feasibility of the proposed control law, asymptotical stability conditions are derived based on Lyapunov stability theory. Landing experimental results are reported for a UAV-ASV system consisting of an M-100 UAV and a self-developed three-meters-long HUSTER-30 ASV on a lake to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed landing control method.

AB Edge intelligence autonomous driving (EIAD) offers computing resources in autonomous vehicles for training deep neural networks. However, wireless channels between the edge server and the autonomous vehicles are time-varying due to the high-mobility of vehicles. Moreover, the required number of training samples for different data modalities, e.g., images, point-clouds, is diverse. Consequently, when collecting these datasets from vehicles to the edge server, the associated bandwidth and power allocation across all data frames is a large-scale multi-modal optimization problem. This letter proposes a highly computationally efficient algorithm that directly maximizes the quality of training (QoT). The key ingredients include a data-driven model for quantifying the priority of data modality and two first-order methods termed accelerated gradient projection and dual decomposition for low-complexity resource allocation. Finally, high-fidelity simulations in Car Learning to Act (CARLA) show that the proposed algorithm reduces the perception error by 3% and the computation time by 98%.

AB Through modern driver assistant systems, algorithmic decisions already have a significant impact on the behavior of vehicles in everyday traffic. This will become even more prominent in the near future considering the development of autonomous driving functionality. The need to consider ethical principles in the design of such systems is generally acknowledged. However, scope, principles and strategies for their implementations are not yet clear. Most of the current discussions concentrate on situations of unavoidable crashes in which the life of human beings is existentially affected. In this paper, we argue that ethical considerations should be mandatory for any algorithmic decision of autonomous vehicles, instead of a limitation to hazard situations. Such an ethically aligned behavior is relevant because autonomous vehicles, like any other traffic participants, operate in a shared public space, where every behavioral decision impacts the operational possibilities of others. These possibilities concern the fulfillment of a road-user's safety, utility and comfort needs. We propose that, to operate ethically in such space, an autonomous vehicle will have to take its behavior decisions according to a just distribution of operational possibilities among all traffic participants. Using an application on a partially-autonomous prototype vehicle, we describe how to apply and implement concepts of distributive justice to the driving environment and demonstrate the impact on its behavior in comparison to an advanced but egoistic decision maker.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB High-speed highway on-ramp merging is a significant challenge toward realizing fully automated driving (level 4). Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), that combine communication and autonomous driving technologies, may improve greatly the safety performances when performing highway on-ramp merging. However, even with the emergence of CAVs, some keys constraints should be considered to achieve a safe on-ramp merging. First, human-driven vehicles will still be present on the road, and it may take decades before all the commercialized vehicles will be fully autonomous and connected. Also, onboard vehicle sensors may provide inaccurate or incomplete data due to sensors limitations and blind spots, especially in such critical situations. To resolve these issues, the present work introduces a novel solution that uses an off-board Road-Side Unit (RSU) to realize fully automated highway on-ramp merging for connected and automated vehicles. Our proposed approach is based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict drivers' intentions. This prediction is used as an input state to a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent that outputs the longitudinal acceleration for the merging vehicle. To achieve this, we first propose a data-driven model that can predict the behavior of the human-driven vehicles in the main highway lane, with 99% accuracy. We use the output of this model as input state to train a Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (TD3) agent that learns ``safe'' and ``cooperative'' driving policy to perform highway on-ramp merging. We show that our proposed decision-making strategy improves performance compared to the solutions proposed previously.

AB In the development of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs), guaranteeing vehicle driving safety is a major concern. Among various aspects that need to be thoughtfully considered for driving safety, vehicle stability is one of the most fundamental and important factors. In this paper, to describe a guaranteed vehicle stability control problem, a new time-varying control-dependent invariant set is introduced. Correspondingly, the concept of a time-varying control-dependent barrier function (CDBF) is proposed. The proposed time-varying CDBF is more general than conventional control barrier functions (CBF), since we additionally consider invariant sets that can be time-varying and control-dependent, which will have broader applications. Then, using the proposed framework, we design a vehicle stability control algorithm, which guarantees that the vehicle states are always kept in the time-varying and control-dependent lateral stability regions. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed theory and control method are verified and discussed through illustrative simulation results of high-speed J-turn and double lane change maneuvers for an AGV.

ID SAFETY
AB Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology is quickly becoming a reality on US roads. Testing on public roads is currently undergoing, with many AV makers located and testing in Silicon Valley, California. The California Department of Motor Vehicles (CA DMV) currently mandates that any vehicle tested on California public roads be retrofitted to account for a back-up human driver, and that data related to disengagements of the AV technology be publicly available. Disengagements data is analyzed in this work, given the safety-critical role of AV disengagements, which require the control of the vehicle to be handed back to the human driver in a safe and timely manner. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the fragmented data obtained from AV manufacturers testing on California public roads from 2014 to 2017. Trends of disengagement reporting, associated frequencies, average mileage driven before failure, and an analysis of triggers and contributory factors are here presented. The analysis of the disengagements data also highlights several shortcomings of the current regulations. The results presented thus constitute an important starting point for improvements on the current drafts of the testing and deployment regulations for autonomous vehicles on public roads.

AB The motion status recognition of the preceding vehicle in a long-distance region is a requirement for autonomous vehicles to make appropriate decisions and increase their comprehension of the environment. At present, the lane change behavior of the leading vehicle at a short distance is detected using stereo cameras and LiDAR. However, the short detection distance (about 100 m) does not meet the requirements of high-speed driving of autonomous vehicles on expressways; this is a fundamental problem limiting the development of autonomous vehicles exhibiting human-like behavior. In this paper, a comprehensive model consisting of a back-propagation (BP) neural network model optimized by a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, and a continuous identification model is developed based on the results of naturalistic on-road experiments using millimeter-wave radar data. By considering different time-to-lane crossings (TLCs), the PSO-BP neural network model is trained using real vehicle lane change data and implemented when the TLC of the leading vehicle is longer than 1.0 s. In contrast, when the TLC is less than 1 s, the continuous recognition model of the TLC is used. By comparison with the BP neural network model, the recognition accuracy rate of the proposed model is increased from 80% to 87% after the PSO optimization for a time window of 1.0 s; these results meet the recognition requirements of the autonomous driving systems for distant targets. The findings of this paper improve the cognitive competence and safety of autonomous driving systems.

AB Recent advancements in autonomous vehicle technology have led to projections that fully autonomous vehicles could define the transportation network within the coming years. In preparation for this disruptive innovation in transportation technology, transportation scholars have started to assess the potential impacts of autonomous vehicles, and transportation policymakers have started to formulate policy recommendations and regulatory guidance concerning their deployment. However, there has been little analysis of the public health implications arising from the widespread adoption of fully autonomous vehicles. We examine these prospective public health impacts both benefits and harms to individual and population health and analyze how they can be considered in the development of transportation policy. in this manuscript, we discuss the evolving relationship between technological innovations in transportation and public health, conceptualize automated transportation as a disruptive technology necessitating a public policy response, and define a research agenda to examine the public health implications of autonomous vehicle policy, as seen through existing evidence on road casualties, environmental health, aging populations, non-communicable disease, land use, and labor markets. We conclude that such a public health research agenda would provide a basis to frame autonomous vehicle policies that best support the public's health, realize the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to ensure healthy lives and create sustainable cities, and provide a basis for public health participation in transportation policy reforms.

AB This paper investigates the trajectory tracking control problem of steer-by-wire autonomous ground vehicle considering the complete failure of vehicle steering motor. In order to achieve the trajectory tracking control of autonomous ground vehicle in presence of the complete failure of vehicle steering motor, the mechanical transmission mechanism of vehicle steering system is analyzed with the steering motor fault being considered, and the differential steering is used to actuate the turning of vehicle in case of emergency. A model predictive controller with the constraints of tire cornering angle and road adhesion is designed to compute the expected frontwheel steering angle for vehicle trajectory tracking control, and a nonsingular terminal sliding mode controller is proposed to track the expected front-wheel steering angle using differentialsteering moment, in which a novel observer design method is presented to estimate the actual front-wheel steering angle. Two case studies are implemented in a CarSim-Simulink co-simulation platform, and the simulation results have verified that the proposed method have satisfactory trajectory tracking control effectiveness in presence of the complete failure of vehicle steering motor.

AB Today, vehicles use smart sensors to collect data from the road environment. This data is often processed onboard of the vehicles, using expensive hardware. Such onboard processing increases the vehicle's cost, quickly drains its battery, and exhausts its computing resources. Therefore, offloading tasks onto the cloud is required. Still, data offloading is challenging due to low latency requirements for safe and reliable vehicle driving decisions. Moreover, age of processing was not considered in prior research dealing with low-latency offloading for autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes an age of processing-based offloading approach for autonomous vehicles using unsupervised machine learning, Multi-Radio Access Technologies (multi-RATs), and Edge Computing in Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN). We design a collaboration space of edge clouds to process data in proximity to autonomous vehicles. To reduce the variation in offloading delay, we propose a new communication planning approach that enables the vehicle to optimally preselect the available RATs such as Wi-Fi, LTE, or 5G to offload tasks to edge clouds when its local resources are insufficient. We formulate an optimization problem for age-based offloading that minimizes elapsed time from generating tasks and receiving computation output. To handle this non-convex problem, we develop a surrogate problem. Then, we use the Lagrangian method to transform the surrogate problem to unconstrained optimization problem and apply the dual decomposition method. The simulation results show that our approach significantly minimizes the age of processing in data offloading with 90.34% improvement over similar method.

ID NAVIGATION; FILTER; DESIGN; MODEL
AB In this paper, a steering control system for the path tracking of autonomous vehicles is described. The steering control system consists of a path tracker and primitive driver. The path tracker generates the desired steering angle by using the look-ahead distance, vehicle heading, and a lateral offset. A method for applying an autonomous vehicle to path tracking is an advanced pure pursuit method that can reduce cutting corners, which is a weakness of the pure pursuit method. The steering controller controls the steering actuator to follow the desired steering angle. A servo motor is installed to control the steering handle, and it can transmit the steering force using a belt and pulley. We designed a steering controller that is applied to a proportional integral differential controller. However, because of a dead band, the path tracking performance And stability of autonomous. vehicles are reduced. To overcome the dead band, a dead band compensator was developed. As a result of the compensator, the path tracking performance and stability are improved.

AB The operational demand for unmanned underwater vehicles has been growing rapidly in the recent past. For long range operations, such as oceanographic exploration and surveying, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) which are equipped with on-board power and advanced control and navigation, have more promises to carry out tasks with the minimum operator intervention. Unlike other fixed platforms, autonomous underwater vehicles are particularly of interest due to their ability to provide continuous spatial and temporal observations. The safe operation of AUV relies on its autonomous navigation and control system. The paper is concerned with the synthesis of control system for an autonomous underwater vehicle using a coefficient diagram method. CDM is an algebraic approach applied to polynomial loop in the parameter space, where the so-called coefficient diagram is used as the means to convey the necessary design information and as the criteria of good design. The effectiveness of the control technique is demonstrated through a number of automatic control designs for motions in the longitudinal mode of AUV Squid, an autonomous underwater robotic designed and developed at Institut Teknologi Bandung.

AB This paper takes L0 (ordinary vehicles), L2 and L4 (autonomous vehicles) as the research objects, adopts different car-following rules and improves them respectively based on driver's personality factors and variable time headway (VTH) strategy, introduces a benefit parameters to distinguish lane changing ability of them, and evaluates road capacity under mixed traffic flow with a basic diagram model and average travel time. Use SUMO to build a simulation platform and conduct a real-time systematic research based on Python. The results prove that: (1) After the penetration rate of autonomous exceeds 60 %, road capacity can be effectively improved, and the maximum increase of 32.52 % occurs in 100 % penetration scenario. (2) When traffic density is less than 27 vehicles/km, the average speed continues to be the maximum in 100 % scenario, and when it is greater than 27 vehicles/km, the critical penetration scenario is 80 %. (3) The average travel time begins to decrease after the penetration rate exceeds 20 %, and can be reduced by 23.38 % in 100 % scenario. It shows that traffic efficiency is closely associated with penetration rates of autonomous vehicles.

ID TAKEOVER REQUESTS; TRANSITION; IMPACT; TIME
AB Research related to autonomous vehicles and to their implications for human-machine interactions is on the rise. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems have become increasingly popular in vehicles currently deployed on the market, making researchers wonder about potential risks in case of technology failures for drivers that become accustomed to the use of such technology. To further our understanding of such concern, this work looks at the currently available data from autonomous vehicles field testing that has been carried out in California from 2014 to 2017. Our examination includes both qualitative and quantitative analyses, respectively, based on (i) the type of response in terms of control takeover in off-nominal scenarios that led to collisions involving autonomous vehicles; and (ii) the time to takeover after disengagements of the autonomous technology that acts as "brain" of the vehicle, with the request to the human driver to regain control of the vehicle. Our findings include expected values for the response time, discussion of factors that affect dispersion, presentation of how to determine trust and experience effects in the data, as well as a careful comparison with state-of-the-art literature on the topic.

   Perturbation methods; Object detection; Solid modeling; 3-D object

AB In recent years, many deep learning models have been adopted in autonomous driving. At the same time, these models introduce new vulnerabilities that may compromise the safety of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, recent studies have demonstrated that adversarial attacks can cause a significant decline in detection precision of deep learning-based 3-D object detection models. Although driving safety is the ultimate concern for autonomous driving, there is no comprehensive study on the linkage between the performance of deep learning models and the driving safety of autonomous vehicles under adversarial attacks. In this article, we investigate the impact of two primary types of adversarial attacks, perturbation attacks, and patch attacks, on the driving safety of vision-based autonomous vehicles rather than the detection precision of deep learning models. In particular, we consider two state-of-the-art models in vision-based 3-D object detection: 1) Stereo R-CNN and 2) DSGN. To evaluate driving safety, we propose an end-to-end evaluation framework with a set of driving safety performance metrics. By analyzing the results of our extensive evaluation experiments, we find that: 1) the attack's impact on the driving safety of autonomous vehicles and the attack's impact on the precision of 3-D object detectors are decoupled and 2) the DSGN model demonstrates stronger robustness to adversarial attacks than the Stereo R-CNN model. In addition, we further investigate the causes behind the two findings with an ablation study. The findings of this article provide a new perspective to evaluate adversarial attacks and guide the selection of deep learning models in autonomous driving.

AB Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) and autonomous vehicles have been widely studied recently for on-road transportation. In the study of autonomous HEVs, the control of the vehicle's external dynamics and powertrain dynamics are often treated separately. Optimizing these two problems together can significantly improve fuel economy. In this article, an autonomous HEV following a leader is considered. First, the augmented model to integrate the abovementioned dynamics is presented. Second, the optimization problem is defined to find the optimum fuel consumption of the follower in pursuit of a leader in a drive cycle. Acustomized control strategy based on Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) is then explored in which the optimal cost-to-go at each time step is approximated using neural networks. Also, the accuracy of the optimization solution is enhanced by applying the concept of the reachable sets. At last, three case studies show that the examined integrated control strategy outperforms the one with the separated optimization method by an additional 7.4%, 4.6%, and 11.8% improvement in fuel consumption, respectively.

AB Given the importance of the communication energy consumption of multiple autonomous underwater vehicle cooperative systems in practical work, this work optimizes the network topology to reduce total energy consumption. In accordance with the characteristics of underwater communication, the energy consumption of communication links is obtained, thereby obtaining the total communication energy consumption of multiple autonomous underwater vehicle cooperative systems. Taking the all-terminal reliability of the communication network as a constraint and the total energy consumption of network communication as the optimization goal, this work puts forward an optimization model for the communication network topology of multiple autonomous underwater vehicle cooperative systems. Furthermore, this work creatively describes the network topology optimization problem as a special path optimization problem suitable for the ant colony optimization algorithm presented to solve the optimization problem and shown to be effective and efficiency on this problem.

AB This paper presents techniques for GPS based autonomous navigation of heavy vehicles at high speed. The control system has two main functions: vehicle position estimation and generation of the steering commands for the vehicle to follow a given path autonomously. Position estimation is based on fusion of measurements from a carrier-phase differential GPS system and odometric sensors using fuzzy logic. A Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controller is used for steering commands generation, to cope with different road geometry and vehicle velocity. The presented system has been implemented in a 13 tons truck, and fully tested in very demanding conditions, i.e. high velocity and large curvature variations in paved and unpaved roads.

AB With the current technological transformation in the automotive industry, autonomous vehicles are getting closer to the Society of Automative Engineers (SAE) automation level 5. This level corresponds to the full vehicle automation, where the driving system autonomously monitors and navigates the environment. With SAE-level 5, the concept of a Shared Autonomous Vehicle (SAV) will soon become a reality and mainstream. The main purpose of an SAV is to allow unrelated passengers to share an autonomous vehicle without a driver/moderator inside the shared space. However, to ensure their safety and well-being until they reach their final destination, active monitoring of all passengers is required. In this context, this article presents a microphone-based sensor system that is able to localize sound events inside an SAV. The solution is composed of a Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) microphone array with a circular geometry connected to an embedded processing platform that resorts to Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology to successfully process in the hardware the sound localization algorithms.

AB This article presents a machine learning-based technique to build a predictive model and generate rules of action to allow autonomous vehicles to perform roundabout maneuvers. The approach consists of building a predictive model of vehicle speeds and steering angles based on collected data related to driver-vehicle interactions and other aggregated data intrinsic to the traffic environment, such as roundabout geometry and the number of lanes obtained from Open-Street-Maps and offline video processing. The study systematically generates rules of action regarding the vehicle speed and steering angle required for autonomous vehicles to achieve complete roundabout maneuvers. Supervised learning algorithms like the support vector machine, linear regression, and deep learning are used to form the predictive models.

A receding-horizon vehicle trajectory planning task is formulated as a sequential global optimization problem with weighted quadratic navigation functions and obstacle avoidance constraints based on given vehicle goal configurations. The feasibility of the formulated optimization problem is guaranteed under derived conditions. The optimization problem is sequentially solved via collaborative neurodynamic optimization in a neurodynamics-driven trajectory planning method/procedure. Simulation results with under-actuated unmanned wheeled vehicles and autonomous surface vehicles are elaborated to substantiate the efficacy of the neurodynamics-driven trajectory planning method.

ID DECISION-MAKING; BEHAVIOR
AB The advancement in sensor technologies, mobile network technologies, and artificial intelligence has pushed the boundaries of different verticals, e.g., eHealth and autonomous driving. Statistics show that more than one million people are killed in traffic accidents yearly, where the vast majority of the accidents are caused by human negligence. Higher-level autonomous driving has great potential to enhance road safety and traffic efficiency. One of the most crucial links to building an autonomous system is the task of decision-making. The ability of a vehicle to make robust decisions on its own by anticipating and evaluating future outcomes is what makes it intelligent. Planning and decision-making technology in autonomous driving becomes even more challenging, due to the diversity of the dynamic environments the vehicle operates in, the uncertainty in the sensor information, and the complex interaction with other road participants. A significant amount of research has been carried out toward deploying autonomous vehicles to solve plenty of issues, however, how to deal with the high-level decision-making in a complex, uncertain, and urban environment is a comparatively less explored area. This paper provides an analysis of decision-making solutions approaches for autonomous driving. Various categories of approaches are analyzed with a comparison to classical decision-making approaches. Following, a crucial range of research gaps and open challenges have been highlighted that need to be addressed before higher-level autonomous vehicles hit the roads. We believe this survey will contribute to the research of decision-making methods for autonomous vehicles in the future by equipping the researchers with an overview of decision-making technology, its potential solution approaches, and challenges.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles have long been used in marine explorations, and their application in recent polar expeditions is particularly noteworthy. However, the complexity and extreme conditions of the polar environment pose risks to the stable operation of autonomous underwater vehicles. This study adopted the methodology of fuzzy fault tree analysis to deeply analyze the operational risks of autonomous underwater vehicles in polar environments. While traditional fault tree analysis maps the causal relationships and probabilities between basic and intermediate events, fuzzy fault tree analysis models the uncertainty of data and determines the failure probability by integrating expert opinions. This study revealed that polar environment-induced failures play a more substantial role in autonomous underwater vehicle loss in polar regions than inherent system failures. The study identified 'recovery failure' and 'poor communication' as the major risk factors facing autonomous underwater vehicles in polar environments, exhibiting the highest failure probabilities. Specifically, among various polar environmental factors, 'large ice concentration', 'ice thickness', and 'roughness of ice underside' under 'bad' conditions were found to have a significant impact on the autonomous underwater vehicle's failure probability. The fuzzy fault tree analysis method in this study successfully filled the gap created by the absence of historical data by effectively incorporating expert opinions, enabling a quantitative presentation of the impact of polar environments, which has been previously difficult to convey in qualitative terms.

AB Speech emotion recognition (SER) is becoming the main human-computer interaction logic for autonomous vehicles in the next generation of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). It can improve not only the safety of autonomous vehicles but also the personalized in-vehicle experience. However, current vehicle-mounted SER systems still suffer from two major shortcomings. One is the insufficient service capacity of the vehicle communication network, which is unable to meet the SER needs of autonomous vehicles in next-generation ITSs in terms of the data transmission rate, power consumption, and latency. Second, the accuracy of SER is poor, and it cannot provide sufficient interactivity and personalization between users and vehicles. To address these issues, we propose an SER-enhanced traffic efficiency solution for autonomous vehicles in a 5G-enabled space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN)-based ITS. First, we convert the vehicle speech information data into spectrograms and input them into an AlexNet network model to obtain the high-level features of the vehicle speech acoustic model. At the same time, we convert the vehicle speech information data into text information and input it into the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model to obtain the high-level features of the corresponding text model. Finally, these two sets of high-level features are cascaded together to obtain fused features, which are sent to a softmax classifier for emotion matching and classification. Experiments show that the proposed solution can improve not only the SAGIN's service capabilities, resulting in a large capacity, high bandwidth, ultralow latency, and high reliability, but also the accuracy of vehicle SER as well as the performance, practicality, and user experience of the ITS.

AB This paper proposes a robust lane detection algorithm with a cascade particle filter that incorporates a model decomposition approach. Despite the sophisticated tracking mechanism of a particle filter, the conventional particle-filter-based lane detection system suffers from an estimation accuracy problem and a high computational load. In order to improve the robustness and the computation time for lane detection systems, the proposed cascade particle filter decomposes a lane model into two submodels: a straight model and a curve model. By dividing the lane model, not only can the computation time be decreased, but also the accuracy of the lane state estimation system can be increased. The proposed lane detection algorithm and the cascade particle filter were evaluated on various roads and environmental conditions with the autonomous vehicle A1, which was the winner of the 2010 and 2012 Autonomous Vehicle Competition in the Republic of Korea organized by the Hyundai motor group. The proposed algorithm proved to be sufficiently robust and fast to be applied to autonomous vehicles as well as to intelligent vehicles for improving the vehicle safety.

AB Autonomous vehicles that travel without considering the lane marks and utilizing all road width have an opportunity to maximize the use of vehicles' performance. By taking advantage of the entire width of curvy roads and the cooperative behavior of connected autonomous vehicles, new options for path planning can be implemented while utilizing the existing infrastructure. The proposed cooperative controller uses a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) approach for dozens of autonomous vehicles without considering lane marks. This controller maximizes vehicles' progress on the road with minimal control efforts while complying with design constraints imposed by road geometry, distances between vehicles, and vehicle dynamics. The controller is tested in two simulation case studies. The first examines the performance under two different plant (reality) models. The second considers dozens of vehicles and compares the traffic flow characteristics between the lane-free concept and the lane-based concept within different vehicle densities. The simulation results show that the lane-free concept can improve the traffic flow performance compared with the lane-based road concept, i.e. reducing passengers' time on the road, reducing energy consumption, and increasing road capacity. These improvements depend on the road density and track layout. In order to demonstrate the proposed controller, three laboratory experiments with several homogeneous and heterogeneous robots were conducted.

AB Vehicles are highly coupled and multi-degree nonlinear systems. The establishment of an appropriate vehicle dynamical model is the basis of motion planning for autonomous vehicles. With the development of autonomous vehicles from L2 to L3 and beyond, the automatic driving system is required to make decisions and plans in a wide range of speeds and on bends with large curvature. In order to make precise and high-quality control maneuvers, it is important to account for the effects of dynamical coupling in these working conditions. In this paper, a new single-coupled dynamical model (SDM) is proposed to deal with the various dynamical coupling effects by identifying and simplifying the complicated one. An autonomous vehicle motion planning problem is then formulated using the nonlinear model predictive control theory (NMPC) with the SDM constraint (NMPC-SDM). We validated the NMPC-SDM with hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments to evaluate improvements to control performance by comparing with the planners original design, using the kinematic and single-track models. The comparative results show the superiority of the proposed motion planning algorithm in improving the maneuverability and tracking performance.

AB In this contribution, a fault-tolerant control strategy for the longitudinal dynamics of an autonomous vehicle is presented. The aim is to be able to detect potential failures of the vehicle's speed sensor and then to keep the vehicle in a safe state. For this purpose, the separation principle, composed of a static output feedback controller and fault estimation observers, is designed. Indeed, two observer techniques were proposed: the proportional and integral observer and the descriptor observer. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated by means of the experimental demonstrator of the VEDECOM (Vehicle Decarbone et Communinicant) Institut.

AB As smart connected vehicles become increasingly common and pave the way for the autonomous vehicles of the future, their ability to provide enhanced safety and assistance services has improved. One such service is the emergency transport of drivers in medical distress: as a positive solution of the distress is typically more likely after timely response, an autonomous vehicle could cut on emergency response times, and thus play a key role in saving the life of its driver.In this paper, we show how such an autonomous emergency transport service can be run from a wireless cellular network, and discuss the importance of having a human in the loop in order to expedite driving. We present a Monte-Carlo-based driver assessment system that the network can use when selecting the most suitable candidate to wirelessly tow an autonomous vehicle with an incapacitated driver. We show that this mechanism results in a selection policy that ensures better cohesion between the vehicles, thereby significantly improving service reliability by reducing the chances of disruptions by intervening traffic.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE
AB Controlling the lateral dynamics of an autonomous vehicle confronting a sudden obstacle requires optimal use of tires' force capacities. In these situations, autonomous steering may not be able to respond fast enough to prevent collision or instability. This paper presents an integrated controller for autonomous vehicles, capable of suitably reacting to emergency situations when a sudden obstacle appears on the road. The proposed controller employs differential braking conservatively when needed, to produce an additional yaw moment, thereby improving a vehicle's lateral agility and responsiveness without endangering vehicle stability. A longitudinal controller is also designed to track a desired longitudinal velocity. Model predictive control (MPC) method is used for developing a combined path planning and tracking controller with a hierarchical structure that prioritizes (1) collision avoidance, (2) vehicle stability, and (3) path tracking. The effectiveness of the proposed integrated MPC controller is evaluated by simulating an experimentally validated CarSim model to demonstrate the controller's capability in preventing instability and collisions.

AB Cooperative computing is promising to enhance the performance and safety of autonomous vehicles benefiting from the increase in the amount, diversity as well as scope of data resources. However, effective and privacy-preserving utilization of multi-modal and multi-source data remains an open challenge during the construction of cooperative mechanisms. Recently, Transformers have demonstrated their potential in the unified representation of multi-modal features, which provides a new perspective for effective representation and fusion of diverse inputs of intelligent vehicles. Federated learning proposes a distributed learning scheme and is hopeful to achieve privacy-secure sharing of data resources among different vehicles. Towards privacy-preserving computing and cooperation in autonomous driving, this paper reviews recent progress of Transformers, federated learning as well as cooperative perception, and proposes a hierarchical structure of Transformers for intelligent vehicles which is comprised of Vehicular Transformers, Federated Vehicular Transformers and the Federation of Vehicular Transformers to exploit their potential in privacy-preserving collaboration.

AB For autonomous driving area, the communication among autonomous vehicles is quite frequent and inevitable to perceive the surrounding environment. Massive data needs to be processed in time on the edge to control vehicles to make suitable strategies. For a group of vehicles, collaborative strategies are necessary to avoid unintentional congestions. However, less attention is paid to competition and cooperation between vehicle groups. In this paper, we explore the possibility of adopting game theory for decision making to obtain win-win between autonomous vehicles. The Lemke-Howson algorithm in game theory is the best known combinatorial algorithm that computes a Nash equilibrium of a bimatrix game. More importantly, we implement the Lemke-Howson algorithm on FPGA to accelerate the computation process. We explain the design challenges of solving the performance bottleneck and how to make optimizations. We implement the Lemke-Howson accelerator on a KCU116 board and obtain a speedup of about 2.4 times versus that running on a CPU.

AB With the increasing maturity of automatic driving technology, the homogeneous traffic flow will gradually evolve into the heterogeneous traffic flow, which consists of human-driving and autonomous vehicles. To better study the characteristics of the heterogeneous traffic system, this paper proposes a new car-following model for autonomous vehicles and heterogeneous traffic flow, which considers the self-stabilizing effect of vehicles. Through linear and nonlinear methods, this paper deduces and analyzes the stability of such a car-following model with the self-stabilizing effect. Finally, the model is verified by numerical simulation. Numerical results show that the self-stabilizing effect can make the heterogeneous traffic flow more stable, and that increasing the self-stabilizing coefficient or historical time length can strengthen the stability of heterogeneous traffic flow and alleviate traffic congestion effectively. In addition, the heterogeneous traffic flow can also be stabilized with a higher proportion of autonomous vehicles.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) transform traditional commuting by decreasing congestion, improving road safety, and naturally integrate better with electric controls for flexible implementation of autonomous driving technologies. Indeed, electric-powered AVs or autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) are benefiting each other in many aspects. While autonomy brings great efficiency in driving as well as battery use, electric vehicles (EVs) require less maintenance and drastically cut fuel costs. With AVs, a pivotal concern is within the realm of long-range autonomous valet parking (LAVP), such as diverse customer demands on parking (or drop-off/pick-up) for various journey planning. On the other hand, electric-powered AVs are typically with limited cruising range, and locating convenient charging services are also among the major impediments. As of yet, recent studies have started to investigate EV charging and LAVP in isolation as they rarely consider a joint optimization on user trip and energy refueling. Rather, we target in this work the integration of vehicle charging with autonomy in the sense of a systemic approach. Specifically, we propose an integrated AEV charging and LAVP management scheme, to resolve critical decision-making on convenient charging and parking management upon customer requirements during their journeys. The proposed scheme jointly considers charging reservations as well as parking duration at car parks (CPs), aiming to enable accurate predictions on future charging (and parking) states at CPs. Results show the advantage of our proposal over benchmarks, in terms of enhanced customer experiences in traveling period, as well as charging performances at both AEV and CP sides. Particularly, effective load balancing can be achieved across the network regarding the amount of charged as well as parked vehicles.

AB Human-machine cooperative driving is an important stage in the development of autonomous driving technology. However, in emergencies, the problem of vehicle stability control for human-computer cooperative autonomous vehicles is still worthy of attention. This paper mainly realizes the stability control of the human-machine cooperative driving vehicle through active steering and considers the influence of the change of vehicle speed on the vehicle stability control performance. Therefore, a vehicle stability control method based on the superposition of steering torque is proposed, in which the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model is used to solve the variable parameter problem. Firstly, a vehicle system model with steering moment as input is established to ensure that the driver can participate in the steering control. Secondly, the nonlinear T-S fuzzy model is established by fuzzifying the local linear model. Then, the parallel-distributed-compensation (PDC) method is used to design the vehicle stability controller, and the asymptotic stability of the system in the range of variable parameters is proved by using the Lyapunov stability principle. Finally, the simulation and experimental results show that the control method can improve the handling stability of the human-machine cooperative driving vehicle under the condition of vehicle speed variation.

AB Forecasting the trajectories of neighbor vehicles is a crucial step for decision making and motion planning of autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes a graph-based spatial-temporal convolutional network (GSTCN) to predict future trajectory distributions of all neighbor vehicles using past trajectories. This network tackles spatial interactions using a graph convolutional network (GCN), and captures temporal features with a convolutional neural network (CNN). The spatial-temporal features are encoded and decoded by a gated recurrent unit (GRU) network to generate future trajectory distributions. Besides, we propose a weighted adjacency matrix to describe the intensities of mutual influence between vehicles, and the ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of our scheme. Our network is evaluated on two real-world freeway trajectory datasets: I-80 and US-101 in the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM). Comparisons in three aspects, including prediction errors, model sizes, and inference speeds, show that our network can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

AB Autonomous vehicles offer greater passenger convenience and improved fuel efficiency. However, they are likely to increase road transport activity and life cycle greenhouse emissions, due to several rebound effects. In this study, we investigate tradeoffs between improved fuel economy and rebound effects from a life-cycle perspective. Our results show that autonomy introduces an average 21.2% decrease in operation phase emissions due to improved fuel economy while manufacturing phase emissions can surge up to 40%. Recycling efforts can offset this increase, cutting emissions by 6.65 tons of Carbon dioxide equivalent per vehicle. However, when examining the entire life cycle, autonomous electric vehicles might emit 8% more greenhouse gas emissions on average compared to nonautonomous electric vehicles. To address this, we suggest; (1) cleaner and more efficient manufacturing technologies, (2) ongoing fuel efficiency improvements in autonomous driving; (3) renewable energy adoption for charging, and (4) circular economy initiatives targeting the complete life cycle.
   Autonomous electric vehicles reduce operational emissions but increase manufacturing emissions due to rebound effects. Recycling helps, but their full life cycle emits 8% more greenhouse gases. Embrace renewable energy, circular economy, cleaner manufacturing, and improved efficiency.

AB In the last decade, electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a sustainable transportation alternative to traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) cars, with automotive software as the key driver behind the advancements. A well-defined information and communication technology (ICT) architecture, comprised of electronics and software, can increase an EV's energy and cost efficiency, safety and comfort. With connected and autonomous electric vehicles (CAEVs) fast becoming a reality, the importance of software in vehicles increases tenfold. This paper serves as an introduction into the field of electromobility and automotive software. It provides an overview of the software and ICT architecture found in CAEVs and identifies future trends and challenges in automotive software development.

AB This paper presents the design and implementation of BAICal (Intelligent Autonomous Buoy by the University of Calabria), an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) developed at the Autonomous Systems Lab (LASA) of the Department of Computer Science, Modeling, Electronics, and Systems Engineering (DIMES), University of Calabria. The basic project was born as a research program in marine robotics with multiple applications, either in the sea or in lake/river environments, for data monitoring, search and rescue operations and diver support tasks. Mechanical and hardware designs are discussed by considering a three-degree-of-freedom (3DoF) dynamical model of the vehicle. An extension to the typical guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) software architecture is presented. The software design and the implementation of a manager module (M-GNC architecture) that allows the vehicle to autonomously coordinate missions are described. Indeed, autonomous guidance and movement are only one of several more complex tasks that mobile robots have to perform in a real scenario and that allow a long-term life cycle. Module-based software architecture is developed by using the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework that is suitable for different kinds of autonomous vehicles, such as aerial, ground, surface or underwater drones.

AB We demonstrate that autonomous-assisted delivery can yield significant improvements relative to today's system in which a delivery person must park the vehicle before delivering packages. We model an autonomous vehicle that can drop off the delivery person at selected points in the city where the delivery person makes deliveries to the final addresses on foot. Then, the vehicle picks up the delivery person and travels to the next reloading point. In this way, the delivery person would never need to look for parking or walk back to a parking place. Based on the number of customers, driving speed of the vehicle, walking speed of the delivery person, and the time for loading packages, we characterize the optimal solution to the autonomous case on a solid rectangular grid of customers, showing the optimal solution can be found in polynomial time. To benchmark the completion time of the autonomous case, we introduce a traditional model for package delivery services that includes the time to search for parking. If the time to find parking is ignored, we show the introduction of an autonomous vehicle reduces the completion time of delivery to all customers by 0%-33%. When nonzero times to find parking are considered, the delivery person saves 30%-77% with higher values achieved for longer parking times, smaller capacities, and lower fixed time for loading packages.

AB In order to simplify the design of path tracking controller and solve the problem relating to nonlinear dynamic model of autonomous underwater vehicle motion planning, feedback linearization method is first adopted to transform the nonlinear dynamic model into an equivalent pseudo-linear dynamic model in horizontal coordinates. Then considering wave disturbance effect, mixed-sensitivity method of H robust control is applied to design state-feedback controller for this equivalent dynamic model. Finally, control law of pseudo-linear dynamic model is transformed into state (surge velocity and yaw angular rate) tracking control law of nonlinear dynamic model through inverse coordinate transformation. Simulation indicates that autonomous underwater vehicle path tracking is successfully implemented with this proposed method, and the influence of parameter variation in autonomous underwater vehicle dynamic model on its tracking performance is reduced by H controller. All the results show that the method proposed in this article is effective and feasible.

AB It is believed that autonomous vehicles will replace conventional human drive vehicles in the next decades due to the emerging autonomous driving technology, which will definitely bring a massive transformation in the road transport sector. Due to the high complexity of traffic systems, efficient traffic simulation models for the assessment of this disruptive change are critical. The objective of this paper is to justify that the common practice of microscopic traffic simulation needs thorough revision and modification when it is applied with the presence of autonomous vehicles in order to get realistic results. Two high-fidelity traffic simulators (SUMO and VISSIM) were applied to show the sensitivity of microscopic simulation to automated vehicle's behavior. Two traffic evaluation indicators (average travel time and average speed) were selected to quantitatively evaluate the macro-traffic performance of changes in driving behavior parameters (gap acceptance) caused by emerging autonomous driving technologies under different traffic demand conditions.

AB The ability of the autonomous farming vehicle to accurately and quickly track complex reference trajectories in the field is critical to crop yields and farmer incomes. The novelty of this paper is to design a new adaptive finite-time trajectory tracking control strategy with an adaptive extended state observer to improve the autonomous farming vehicle's trajectory tracking accuracy and convergence speed in the complex farm operating environment. The adaptive extended state observer is constructed to deal with the slip disturbance and parameter uncertainty to improve the tracking accuracy. The finite-time control strategy is adopted to improve the convergence speed of the trajectory tracking of the autonomous farming vehicle. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed control strategy are verified by comparing it with the active disturbance rejection control and traditional PID control strategies under MATLAB/Simulink environment.

AB The automotive industry is increasing its effort towards scientific and technological innovations regarding autonomous vehicles. The expectation is a reduction of road accidents, which are too often caused by human errors. Moreover, technological solutions, such as connected autonomous vehicle platoons, are expected to help humans in emergency situations. In this context, safety and security issues do not yet have a satisfactory answer. In this paper, we address the domain of secure communication among vehicles - especially the issues related to authentication and authorization of inter-vehicular signals and services carrying safety commands. We propose a novel design methodology, where we take a contract-based approach for specifying safety, and combine it in the design flow with the use of the Arrowhead Framework to support security. Furthermore, we present the results through a demo, which employs model-based design for software implementation and the physical realization on autonomous model cars.

AB Autonomous driving vehicles (ADVs) are sleeping giant intelligent machines that perceive their environment and make driving decisions. Most existing ADSs are built as hand-engineered perception-planning-control pipelines. However, designing generalized handcrafted rules for autonomous driving in an urban environment is complex. An alternative approach is imitation learning (IL) from human driving demonstrations. However, most previous studies on IL for autonomous driving face several critical challenges: (1) poor generalization ability toward the unseen environment due to distribution shift problems such as changes in driving views and weather conditions; (2) lack of interpretability; and (3) mostly trained to learn the single driving task. To address these challenges, we propose a view-invariant spatiotemporal attentive planning and control network for autonomous vehicles. The proposed method first extracts spatiotemporal representations from images of a front and top driving view sequence through attentive Siamese 3DResNet. Then, the maximum mean discrepancy loss (MMD) is employed to minimize spatiotemporal discrepancies between these driving views and produce an invariant spatiotemporal representation, which reduces domain shift due to view change. Finally, the multitasking learning (MTL) method is employed to jointly train trajectory planning and high-level control tasks based on learned representations and previous motions. Results of extensive experimental evaluations on a large autonomous driving dataset with various weather/lighting conditions verified that the proposed method is effective for feasible motion planning and control in autonomous vehicles.

AB This paper presents a novel model-reference reinforcement learning algorithm for the intelligent tracking control of uncertain autonomous surface vehicles with collision avoidance. The proposed control algorithm combines a conventional control method with reinforcement learning to enhance control accuracy and intelligence. In the proposed control design, a nominal system is considered for the design of a baseline tracking controller using a conventional control approach. The nominal system also defines the desired behaviour of uncertain autonomous surface vehicles in an obstacle-free environment. Thanks to reinforcement learning, the overall tracking controller is capable of compensating for model uncertainties and achieving collision avoidance at the same time in environments with obstacles. In comparison to traditional deep reinforcement learning methods, our proposed learning-based control can provide stability guarantees and better sample efficiency. We demonstrate the performance of the new algorithm using an example of autonomous surface vehicles.

AB Traffic waves are phenomena that emerge when the vehicular density exceeds a critical threshold. Considering the presence of increasingly automated vehicles in the traffic stream, a number of research activities have focused on the influence of automated vehicles on the bulk traffic flow. In the present article, we demonstrate experimentally that intelligent control of an autonomous vehicle is able to dampen stop-and-go waves that can arise even in the absence of geometric or lane changing triggers. Precisely, our experiments on a circular track with more than 20 vehicles show that traffic waves emerge consistently, and that they can be dampened by controlling the velocity of a single vehicle in the flow. We compare metrics for velocity, braking events, and fuel economy across experiments. These experimental findings suggest a paradigm shift in traffic management: flow control will be possible via a few mobile actuators (less than 5%) long before a majority of vehicles have autonomous capabilities.

AB Part I of this paper proposed a development process and a system platform for the development of autonomous cars based on a distributed system architecture. The proposed development methodology enabled the design and development of an autonomous car with benefits such as a reduction in computational complexity, fault-tolerant characteristics, and system modularity. In this paper (Part II), a case study of the proposed development methodology is addressed by showing the implementation process of an autonomous driving system. In order to describe the implementation process intuitively, core autonomous driving algorithms (localization, perception, planning, vehicle control, and system management) are briefly introduced and applied to the implementation of an autonomous driving system. We are able to examine the advantages of a distributed system architecture and the proposed development process by conducting a case study on the autonomous system implementation. The validity of the proposed methodology is proved through the autonomous car A1 that won the 2012 Autonomous Vehicle Competition in Korea with all missions completed.

Recently, an autonomous vehicle logistic system (AVLS) was proposed, which employs autonomous vehicles to serve logistic requests and utilize the excessive renewable energy generated by distributed generations. In this paper, we propose an optimization problem for AVLS to develop schedules for request allocation, vehicle routing, and battery charging. By considering the unique characteristics of AVLS, the proposed scheduling problem can exploit its advantages in goods delivery and renewable energy utilization over existing logistic request allocation algorithms. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer non-linear program. To improve its scalability, we also devise a two-stage scheduling methodology to approach the optimal solutions of the original problem. We conduct comprehensive simulations to assess the performance of the proposed request scheduling problem and two-stage scheduling methodology. The results indicate that the proposed problem can improve the efficacy of AVLS in terms of total travel distance and utilized renewable energy, and the two-stage methodology can develop near-optimal solutions with notably reduced computation time.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicle are widely used in industries, such as marine resource exploitation and fish farming, but they are often subject to a large amount of interference which cause poor control stability, while performing their tasks. A decoupling control algorithm is proposed and A single control volume-single attitude angle model is constructed for the problem of severe coupling in the control system of attitude of six degrees of freedom Autonomous Underwater Vehicle. Aiming at the problem of complex Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) adjustment relying on manual experience, the PSO-ADRC algorithm is proposed to realize the automatic adjustment of its parameters, which improves the anti-interference ability and control accuracy of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle in dynamic environment. The anti-interference ability and control accuracy of the method were verified through experiments.

AB In this paper, we proposed a new risk assessment based decision-making algorithm to guarantee collision avoidance in multi-scenarios for autonomous vehicles. A probabilistic-model based situation assessment module using conditional random field was proposed to assess the risk level of surrounding traffic participants. Based on the assessed risk from the situation assessment module, a collision avoidance strategy with driving style preferences (e.g., aggressive or conservative) was proposed to meet the demands of different drivers or passengers. Finally, we conducted experiments in Carla (car learning to act) to evaluate our developed collision avoidance decision making algorithm in different scenarios. The results show that our developed method was sufficiently reliable for autonomous vehicles to avoid collisions in multi-scenarios with different driving style preferences. Our developed method with adjustable driving style preferences to meet the demand of different consumers would improve drivers' acceptance of autonomous vehicles.

ID DECISION-MAKING
AB With the advent of autonomous vehicles, sensors and algorithm testing have become crucial parts of the autonomous vehicle development cycle. Having access to real-world sensors and vehicles is a dream for researchers and small-scale original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) due to the software and hardware development life-cycle duration and high costs. Therefore, simulator-based virtual testing has gained traction over the years as the preferred testing method due to its low cost, efficiency, and effectiveness in executing a wide range of testing scenarios. Companies like ANSYS and NVIDIA have come up with robust simulators, and open-source simulators such as CARLA have also populated the market. However, there is a lack of lightweight and simple simulators catering to specific test cases. In this paper, we introduce the SLAV-Sim, a lightweight simulator that specifically trains the behaviour of a self-learning autonomous vehicle. This simulator has been created using the Unity engine and provides an end-to-end virtual testing framework for different reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in a variety of scenarios using camera sensors and raycasts.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Autonomous vehicles need to continuously navigate complex traffic environments by efficiently analyzing the surrounding scene, understanding the behavior of other traffic agents, and predicting their future trajectories. The primary objective is to draw up a safe motion and reduce the reaction time for possibly imminent hazards. The main problem addressed in this paper is to explore the movement patterns of surrounding traffic-agents and accurately predict their future trajectories for assisting the vehicle to make a reasonable decision. Traditional trajectory prediction modules require explicit coordinate information to model the interaction between the autonomous car and its surrounding vehicles. However, it is hard to know the real coordinate of surrounding vehicles in real-world scenarios without communications between vehicles. A GAN (generative adversarial network)-based deep learning framework is presented in this paper for predicting the trajectories of surrounding vehicles of an autonomous vehicle in an RGB image sequence without explicit coordinate annotation to solve this problem. To automatically predict the trajectory from RGB image sequences, a coordinate augmentation module and a coordinate stabilization module are proposed to extract the historical trajectory from an image sequence. Meanwhile, the self-attention mechanism is also proposed to improve the social pooling module for better capturing the context information of trajectories of surrounding vehicles. Experimental results are demonstrated that the proposed method is effective and efficient.

AB According to SAE J3016, autonomous driving can be divided into six levels, and partially automated driving is possible from level three up. A partially or highly automated vehicle can encounter situations involving total system failure. Here, we studied a strategy for safe takeover in such situations. A human-in-the-loop simulator, driver-vehicle interface, and driver monitoring system were developed, and takeover experiments were performed using various driving scenarios and realistic autonomous driving situations. The experiments allowed us to draw the following conclusions. The visual-auditory-haptic complex alarm effectively delivered warnings and had a clear correlation with the user's subjective preferences. There were scenario types in which the system had to immediately enter minimum risk maneuvers or emergency maneuvers without requesting takeover. Lastly, the risk of accidents can be reduced by the driver monitoring system that prevents the driver from being completely immersed in non-driving-related tasks. We proposed a safe takeover strategy from these results, which provides meaningful guidance for the development of autonomous vehicles. Considering the subjective questionnaire evaluations of users, it is expected to improve the acceptance of autonomous vehicles and increase the adoption of autonomous vehicles.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AV) can solve vehicle relocation problems faced by traditional one-way vehicle-sharing systems. This paper explores the deterministic time-dependent system optimum of mixed shared AVs (SAV) and human vehicles (SHV) system to provide the benchmark for the situation of mixed vehicle flows. In such a system, the system planner determines vehicle-traveller assignment and optimal vehicle routing in transportation networks to serve predetermined travel demand of heterogeneous travellers. Due to large number of vehicles involved, travel time is considered endogenous with congestion. Using link transmission model (LTM) as a traffic flow model, the deterministic time-dependent system optimum is formulated as linear programming (LP) model to minimize the comprehensive cost including travellers' travel time cost, waiting time cost and empty vehicle repositioning time cost. Numerical examples are conducted to show system performances and model effectiveness.

The framework of the study is informed by three questions: (1) How well do the collected samples represent the acceptance of the general population? (2) How often does bias exist in measuring public acceptance in AV's questionnaires? (3) How much bias persists in reporting public acceptance of AV's research? The findings indicate that (1) people with disabilities and racial minorities are only included in 10% and 20% of the studies, respectively (2) 50% of the studies present their questionnaire, and most are perceived to be biased as a result of systematic errors such as leading questions, missing questions, and suggestive information, and (3) 72% of the studies suffer from the sentiment bias, where the positive tone in the title and abstract is more significant than in the result. This leads to imprecise findings and unrealistic depictions of acceptance of autonomous vehicles by the public. The analysis alerts researchers and practitioners to empirical evidence of bias in public acceptance of autonomous vehicles and recommends preventive actions.

AB The ethics of autonomous vehicles (AV) has received a great amount of attention in recent years, specifically in regard to their decisional policies in accident situations in which human harm is a likely consequence. Starting from the assumption that human harm is unavoidable, many authors have developed differing accounts of what morality requires in these situations. In this article, a strategy for AV decision-making is proposed, the Ethical Valence Theory, which paints AV decision-making as a type of claim mitigation: different road users hold different moral claims on the vehicle's behavior, and the vehicle must mitigate these claims as it makes decisions about its environment. Using the context of autonomous vehicles, the harm produced by an action and the uncertainties connected to it are quantified and accounted for through deliberation, resulting in an ethical implementation coherent with reality. The goal of this approach is not to define how moral theory requires vehicles to behave, but rather to provide a computational approach that is flexible enough to accommodate a number of 'moral positions' concerning what morality demands and what road users may expect, offering an evaluation tool for the social acceptability of an autonomous vehicle's ethical decision making.

DE Autonomous vehicles; motion control; optimal control; splines;
   trajectory optimization
ID ALGORITHM
AB Autonomous vehicles require a collision-free motion trajectory at every time instant. This brief presents an optimization-based method to calculate such trajectories for autonomous vehicles operating in an uncertain environment with moving obstacles. The proposed approach applies to linear system models, as well as to a particular class of nonlinear models, including industrially relevant vehicles, such as autonomous guided vehicles with front wheel, differential wheel, and rear-wheel steering. The method computes smooth motion trajectories, satisfying the vehicle's kinematics, by using a spline parameterization. Furthermore, it exploits spline properties to keep the resulting nonlinear optimization problem small scale and to guarantee constraint satisfaction, without the need for time gridding. The resulting problem is solved sufficiently fast for online motion planning, dealing with uncertainties and changes in the environment. This brief demonstrates the potential of the method with extensive numerical simulations. In addition, it presents an experimental validation in which a KUKA youBot, steered as a holonomic or differential drive vehicle, drives through an environment with moving obstacles. To facilitate the further development and the numerical and experimental validation of the presented method, it is embodied in a user-friendly open-source software toolbox.

AB PurposeExisting automated vehicle transportation guidelines and regulations have minimal guidance to address the specific needs of people with disabilities. Accessibility should be at the forefront to increase autonomy and independence for people with disabilities. The purpose of this research is to better understand potential facilitators and barriers to using accessible autonomous transportation.MethodsFocus groups were conducted with key stakeholders derived from people with disabilities (n = 5), travel companions/caregivers (n = 5), and transportation experts or designers (n = 11).ResultsThe themes include describing stakeholder perceptions across all three groups by identified themes: autonomous vehicle assistive technology, autonomy vs automation, cost, infrastructure, safety & liability, design challenges, and potential impact.ConclusionSpecific gaps and needs were identified regarding barriers and facilitators for transportation accessibility and evidence-based guidance. These specific gaps can help to formulate design criteria for the communication between, the interior and exterior of accessible autonomous vehicles.

TI Performance Test of Autonomous Vehicle Lidar Sensors Under Different

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; MODEL
AB This paper intends to analyze the Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) sensor performance on detecting pedestrians under different weather conditions. Lidar sensor is the key sensor in autonomous vehicles, which can provide high-resolution object information. Thus, it is important to analyze the performance of Lidar. This paper involves an autonomous bus operating several pedestrian detection tests in a parking lot at the University at Buffalo. By comparing the pedestrian detection results on rainy days with the results on sunny days, the evidence shows that the rain can cause unstable performance and even failures of Lidar sensors to detect pedestrians in time. After analyzing the test data, three logit models are built to estimate the probability of Lidar detection failure. The rainy weather still plays an important role in affecting Lidar detection performance. Moreover, the distance between a vehicle and a pedestrian, as well as the autonomous vehicle velocity, are also important. This paper can provide a way to improve the Lidar detection performance in autonomous vehicles.

TI Maps and the Autonomous Vehicle as a Communication Platform
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
LA English
DT Article
DE autonomous vehicles; communication platform; maps
AB Over the past two decades, there has been growing awareness of and critical interest in the convergence of information and communication technologies and automobiles. Writing in 2004, Mike Featherstone suggests that the "automobile becomes a new form of communications platform with a complex set of possibilities." In this article, we argue that the notion of the car as a communication platform continues to form a productive way of thinking about autonomous vehicles. The argument we develop is that the dual roles of data acquisition and management, and local processing are integral to any understanding of the contemporary autonomous vehicle's "machinic complex." Both of these things are strongly associated with autonomy and the transformation of cars into decision-making machines. We use the example of mapping to argue that these capacities are not unique to the emerging technologies of autonomous vehicles; however, they are essential to them, with significant implications not only for their capabilities as communications platforms, but also more generally for their governance and political economy.

AB This paper addresses the deadlock control problem for the autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval system (AVS/RS). For an AVS/RS with several autonomous vehicles running in bi-direction, deadlock control is one of the key issues in the implementation of AVS/RS. The cycle-deadlock is the main type of deadlock in AVS/RS. In the paper, the dynamic model of AVS/RS is investigated by using coloured timed Petri nets (CTPN). Based on the CTPN model, a route digraph is built to detect cycle-deadlock in AVS/RS with digraph tools; the necessary and sufficient conditions of deadlock-free are established. Moreover deadlock-free control policies are proposed, the critical state in deadlock free is also identified and FCFS policy is applied to solve it. Finally, a case study is given to validate the policies.

AB Pose estimation is a critical problem in autonomous vehicle navigation, especially in circumstances where sensor failure or attacks exist. In this paper, a filter-based secure dynamic pose estimation approach is proposed such that the vehicle pose can be resilient under the possible sensor attacks. Our proposed estimator coincides with the conventional Kalman filter when all sensors on autonomous vehicles are benign. If less than half of the measurement states are compromised by the randomly occurring deception attacks, it still gives stable estimates of the pose states, i.e., an upper bound for the estimation error covariance is guaranteed. The pose estimation results with single and multiple attacks on the testing route validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.

AB In this paper, the longitudinal control is investigated for an autonomous electric vehicle with a tracking differentiator. The autonomous electric vehicle is modelled as a longitudinal system for model predictive control. The tracking differentiator is proposed to obtain the transition profile and acceleration information. A dual-mode model predictive controller is designed for the longitudinal system to find the optimal control input, which is restricted with some constraints on the desired acceleration and its increment. Both iterative feasibility and its stability issues are analysed for the longitudinal system under the dual-mode model predictive controller. Experimental results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

AB The objective of this work is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the development of autonomous vehicle perception systems. So far, most autonomy perception research has been concentrated on improving perception systems' algorithmic quality or combining different sensor setups. In our work, we draw conclusions from participating in the Indy Autonomous Challenge 2021 and its follow-up event in Las Vegas 2022. These were the first head-to-head autonomous racing competitions that required an entire perception pipeline to perceive the environment and the opposing surrounding vehicles. Our research includes quantitative results from collected vehicle data and qualitative results from simulation, video, and multiple race analysis. The Indy Autonomous Challenge was one of the few research projects that considered the entire autonomous vehicle. Therefore, our findings indicate insights on the system level, including hardware setup and full-stack software. We can demonstrate that different sensor modalities in the vehicle have strengths and weaknesses when they are deployed. Our results further show the difficulties and challenges that emerge when multi-modal perception systems must run in real-time on real-world autonomous vehicles. The most concise finding from our investigation is the summary of critical learnings when developing and deploying perception systems for autonomous systems. Given the background of the study, it was inevitable that our conclusions were influenced by driving on the racetrack and only one hardware setup available. Therefore, in the discussion, we draw further parallels to driving on public roads in dense traffic. More studies are needed to investigate the development and deployment of multi-modal perception systems for autonomous road vehicles with different hardware setups and various object detection, localization, and prediction algorithms. The novel contributions of this work are given by 12 lessons learned, summarized in 5 categories. These were derived and validated through a realized real-world application project.

AB This article describes some technical issues regarding the adaptation of a production car to a platform for the development and testing of autonomous driving technologies. A universal approach to performing the reverse engineering of electric power steering (EPS) for the purpose of external control is also presented. The primary objective of the related study was to solve the problem associated with the precise prediction of the dynamic trajectory of an autonomous vehicle. This was accomplished by deriving a new equation for determining the lateral tire forces and adjusting some of the vehicle parameters under road test conductions. A Mivar expert system was also integrated into the control system of the experimental autonomous vehicle. The expert system was made more flexible and effective for the present application by the introduction of hybrid artificial intelligence with logical reasoning. The innovation offers a solution to the major problem of liability in the event of an autonomous transport vehicle being involved in a collision.

ID CONSUMPTION
AB Autonomous Transfer Vehicles (ATVs) are becoming increasingly prevalent in intra logistics. Industry 4.0 is bringing us closer to the efficient routing and scheduling of autonomous multi robot systems which perform transportation tasks. In this study, an energy efficient routing and scheduling system is proposed to minimize the total energy that the vehicles spend. Not only travelled distance but also the load of the vehicle is considered between two points. The routes of vehicles are obtained by using the proposed Hybrid Simulated Annealing Algorithm. An algorithm for the initial solution is also proposed for determining of the minimum number of vehicles for pickup and delivery requests. The performance of the algorithm is compared with the best solutions of the test problems in the literature. Besides, the proposed energy efficient routing and task scheduling model is compared with the classical distance model for routing and scheduling with backhauls. An analysis of trade-offs between energy and distance is proposed for intra logistics.

TI Autonomous taxis could greatly reduce greenhouse-gas emissions of US
   light-duty vehicles
SO NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are conveyances to move passengers or freight without human intervention. AVs are potentially disruptive both technologically and socially(1-3), with claimed benefits including increased safety, road utilization, driver productivity and energy savings(1-6). Here we estimate 2014 and 2030 greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions and costs of autonomous taxis (ATs), a class of fully autonomous(7,8) shared AVs likely to gain rapid early market share, through three synergistic effiects: (1) future decreases in electricity GHG emissions intensity, (2) smaller vehicle sizes resulting from trip-specific AT deployment, and (3) higher annual vehicle-miles travelled (VMT), increasing high-efficiency (especially battery-electric) vehicle cost-effiectiveness. Combined, these factors could result in decreased US per-mile GHG emissions in 2030 per AT deployed of 87-94% below current conventionally driven vehicles (CDVs), and 63-82% below projected 2030 hybrid vehicles(9), without including other energy-saving benefits of AVs. With these substantial GHG savings, ATs could enable GHG reductions even if total VMT, average speed and vehicle size increased substantially. Oil consumption would also be reduced by nearly 100%.

AB To improve the transportation efficiency of advanced manufacturing, cameras have been extensively deployed to enhance the on-road perception of autonomous ground vehicles in smart industrial parks. Considering the informative yet substantial data volume of contents generated by those cameras, we employ vehicle-to-everything links to deliver the captured video frames to neighboring vehicles, road-side units, or base stations, in order to respond to vehicle-control-related video queries. To help vehicles obtain low-latency and high-accuracy on-road information for autonomous driving, an optimization problem is formulated, taking into account the impact of vehicle mobility and diverse resource demands of different video queries. Then, a two-stage algorithm is proposed to determine the frame rate of video cameras, as well as the destination of the associated video frames based on matching theory. Extensive simulation results show that this approach can improve the accuracy by up to 18% and reduce the response delay by 13.2%.

AB This letter is the first report from a series of IEEE TIV's Decentralized and Hybrid Workshops (DHWs) on Intelligent Vehicles for Education (IV4E). The role of intelligent vehicles in promoting education for all ages through autonomous racing was discussed during a recent DHW. Over the past decade, autonomous racing has emerged due to advancements in self-driving technologies. While still focused on extreme speed, autonomous racing differs from conventional automobile racing in its development philosophy, as human drivers are no longer involved. The absence of human drivers should be regarded as a new chance to increase competitiveness and entertainment value. This letter discusses opportunities to promote education-oriented autonomous racing. Recall that the flagship car race is Formula 1, where "formula" denotes technical restrictions that should be satisfied strictly. We name the new race series Autonomous 1 or A1, leveraging the power of autonomous intelligence in education. The achievements made in Formula 1 and typical autonomous races are reviewed, followed by discussions about A1's future perspectives. Specifically, A1 needs to maintain race consistency, update rules, and provide personalized commentary to support all-age education.

AB Over the past few years, many studies have provided detailed descriptions of the potential benefits associated with the introduction of autonomous vehicles, such as improvements in traffic flows, local and global emissions, traffic safety, cost efficiency of public and private transport operations, etc. Additionally, the mobilization of mobility-impaired people and the independent car use of travelers without a driver's license have been identified as potential benefits for users. However, merely estimating the benefits of these direct (or first-order) effects is unlikely to show the full picture of the consequences that will emerge once autonomous vehicles enter the roads. In this paper, we therefore put emphasis on discussing systemic (or second-order) effects. The paper presents a conceptual exploration of these effects based on literature and research findings to date. We show that these systemic effects have the potential - especially in urban areas and without adequate policy intervention - to eliminate at least some of the benefits initially associated with autonomous vehicles. Following this systemic view on autonomous vehicles, we discuss policy aspects for responsible authorities and planners on how to prepare transportation systems for the challenges related to the introduction of autonomous vehicles, and conclude with areas of research that seem highly important in terms of further investigation in this context.

AB As an increasingly prevalent technology in intelligent autonomous transportation systems, autonomous vehicle platoon has been indicated the ability to significantly reduce fuel consumption as well as heighten highway safety and throughput. However, existing efforts rarely focus on protecting data confidentiality and authenticity in autonomous vehicle platoons. How to ensure secure and high-fidelity platoon-level communication is still in its infancy. This paper makes the first attempt for efficient and secure communication across autonomous vehicle platoons. Specifically, we present PDSM-FC, the first privacy-preserving data share mechanism with flexible cross-domain authorization over distinctive platoons. The key insight of PDSM-FC is the design of a new ciphertext conversion technique, which allows a ciphertext to be easily converted into another type of ciphertext, facilitating efficient access by all entities holding the legitimate authorization. As a result, PDSM-FC can achieve high-fidelity data communication between two unique platoons in ciphertext, so as to complete specific tasks including platoon integration. Rigorous security analysis shows that PDSM-FC is secure against various attacks such as collusion, forgery and chosen-plaintext attacks. Moreover, theoretical evaluation and extensive experiments demonstrate the practicability of PDSM-FC in terms of functionality, storage and computation overheads.

AB This paper proposes a coordinated control design method, with which the autonomous vehicle is able to perform ethical maneuvers. The starting point of the provided method is a thorough analysis on the ethical concepts for autonomous vehicle control design methods. Using the results of the analysis, an own concept is provided based on some principles of Protestant ethics. The concept focuses on improving trust in vehicle control through clear rules and predictable vehicle motion, and it is in line with the state-of-the-art ethical vehicle control methods. Moreover, an optimal Model Predictive Control (MPC) design method is formed, in which the provided ethical concept is incorporated. The outputs of the optimal control are steering angle and velocity profile, with which the ethical maneuvering can be achieved. The contribution of the paper is a coordinated control design method, which is able to involve ethical principles. Moreover, the application of Protestant ethics in this context is also a novel achievement in the paper. The effectiveness of the method through different simulation scenarios is illustrated.

DT Article
AB The increasing advances in technologies used in autonomous vehicles have improved the reliability of their controls, making them more likely to be accepted by drivers and thus more common on the streets. When all vehicles become autonomous, traffic lights will need to be more efficient. In this sense, this article presents a computational model to manage the crossing of autonomous vehicles at road intersections, so that they can flow continuously along the roads without needing to stop, except in extreme cases. Based on the developed model, we implemented an algorithm and a simulator to control the behavior of autonomous vehicles with different lengths when crossing an intersection. In order to evaluate the performance of this method, we carried out 10 thousand simulations for each combination of the intersection controller's distances of action and vehicle group size, in a total of 600 thousand simulations. Thus, a relationship was observed between the method's efficiency and the controller's range, where the number of collisions was zero for distances greater than or equal to 2300 m. Method efficiency was also related to the average speeds at which the vehicles crossed the intersection, which was close to their average initial speed.

AB Fault diagnosis for autonomous vehicles aims to provide available information about the operation status of the vehicle to avoid potential risks, and sensor data provide the observations of the system only when sensors are proven to function adequately. Therefore, in the present work a fault diagnosis framework for autonomous vehicles with sensor self-diagnosis is proposed. It uses a residual consistency checking algorithm based on sensor redundancy to detect and isolate failed sensors in sensor self-diagnosis. Then, the denoising shrinkage autoencoder (DSAE) is put forward to address anomaly detection, where a shrinkage block with soft thresholding is embedded into the denoising autoencoder for feature representation enhancement, improving the anomaly detection performance. Several experiments with data collected from an autonomous vehicle in a real test field are implemented, and the results show that the proposed residual consistency checking algorithm can effectively detect and isolate the failed sensor, and the DSAE achieves relatively the best anomaly detection performance in terms of AUC_ROC and F1-score compared with several other machine learning based anomaly detectors studied.

AB This article presents a cartographic system to facilitate cooperative manoeuvres among autonomous vehicles in a well-known environment. The main objective is to design an extended cartographic system to help in the navigation of autonomous vehicles. This system has to allow the vehicles not only to access the reference points needed for navigation, but also noticeable information such as the location and type of traffic signals, the proximity to a crossing, the streets en route, etc. To do this, a hierarchical representation of the information has been chosen, where the information has been stored in two levels. The lower level contains the archives with the Universal Traverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates of the points that define the reference segments to follow. The upper level contains a directed graph with the relational database in which streets, crossings, roundabouts and other points of interest are represented. Using this new system it is possible to know when the vehicle approaches a crossing, what other paths arrive at that crossing, and, should there be other vehicles circulating on those paths and arriving at the crossing, which one has the highest priority. The data obtained from the cartographic system is used by the autonomous vehicles for cooperative manoeuvres.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
AB As autonomous vehicles (AVs) are advancing to higher levels of autonomy and performance, the associated technologies are becoming increasingly diverse. Lane-keeping systems (LKS), corresponding to a key functionality of AVs, considerably enhance driver convenience. With drivers increasingly relying on autonomous driving technologies, the importance of safety features, such as fail-safe mechanisms in the event of sensor failures, has gained prominence. Therefore, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) control method for lane-keeping, which uses surrounding object information derived through LiDAR sensors instead of camera sensors for LKS. This approach uses surrounding vehicle and object information as observations for the RL framework to maintain the vehicle's current lane. The learning environment is established by integrating simulation tools, such as IPG CarMaker, which incorporates vehicle dynamics, and MATLAB Simulink for data analysis and RL model creation. To further validate the applicability of the LiDAR sensor data in real-world settings, Gaussian noise is introduced in the virtual simulation environment to mimic sensor noise in actual operational conditions.

Vehicle models are grouped into numerous types based on the structural characteristics and working conditions, including wheeled tractors, tracked tractors, rice transplanters, high clearance sprays, agricultural robots, agricultural tractor-trailers, etc. The application and improvement of path-tracking control methods are summarized based on the different working scenes and types of agricultural machinery. This study explores each of these methods in terms of accuracy, stability, robustness, and disadvantages/advantages. The main challenges in the field of agricultural vehicle path tracking control are defined, and future research directions are offered based on critical reviews. This review aims to provide a reference for determining which controllers to use in path-tracking control development for an autonomous agricultural vehicle.

TI THE INFLUENCE OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES ON STATE TAX REVENUES
SO NATIONAL TAX JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE slate taxes; transportation taxes; autonomous vehicles
AB States primarily link transportation tax revenues to fossil fuels and number of vehicles and drivers. Transition to autonomous vehicles (AV) is likely to significantly erode each of these tax bases. Simulations for six states suggest they could lose between 2 and 9.2 percent of total tax revenues and 60 percent or more of transportation tax revenues once AVs are fully adopted. States have the opportunity to tax mobility more broadly before the population transitions to AVs. Reform options include imposing the sales tax on all mobility services, levying a VMT tax, or imposing congestion charges.

AB Safety is a major concern for autonomous vehicle driving. The autonomous vehicles relying solely on ego-vehicle sensors have limitations in dealing with collisions. The risk can be reduced by communicating with other vehicles sharing sensed information. In this paper, we study a real-time multisource data fusion scheme based on Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence (DS) through cooperative vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. The classical DS can produce erroneous outputs when confidences are highly conflicting. In particular, a false negative error on object detection may lead to serious accidents. We propose a novel metric to measure distance between confidences on the collected data taking the asymmetry in the importance of sensed events into account. Based on the proposed distance, we consider the weighted DS combination in order to fuse multiple confidences. The proposed scheme is simple, and enables the vehicles to combine confidences in real-time. From real-world experiments, we show that it is feasible to lower the false negative rate by the proposed data fusion scheme, and to avoid accidents using the proposed collision warning system.

AB This study investigates the path following control problem about distributed-drive self-driving vehicle through coordinated control of the autonomous front-wheel steering and the differential steering control, to improve the tracking performance. On the basis of the model predictive control algorithm and vehicle dynamic model, the preview time adaptive control of path following is proposed to realise path following with changing preview time in straight and turning conditions. Considering the characteristics of the distributed-drive self-driving vehicle, the differential torque control is utilised based on the reference heading angle to realise trajectory tracking under the condition of constant torque demands. To integrate the advantages of the two methods, coordinated control of trajectory tracking based on the autonomous steering and differential steering is performed by setting the weight coefficients method. MATLAB co-simulation with Carsim and road testing validation are executed, and both demonstrate that the coordinated control strategy can not only effectively improve the response speed and flexibility of steering, but also improve the reliability and accuracy of trajectory tracking.

AB This study presents the development and optimization of a proposed path tracking controller for an autonomous armoured vehicle. A path tracking control is developed based on an established Stanley controller for autonomous vehicles. The basic controller is modified and applied on a non-linear, 7degree-of-freedom armoured vehicle model, and consists of various modules such as handling model, tire model, engine, and transmission model. The controller is then optimized using particle swarm optimization algorithm to select the optimum set of controller parameters. The main motivation of this study is that implementation of path tracking control on an autonomous armoured vehicle is still very limited and it is important to have a specific study on this field due to the different dynamics and properties of the armoured vehicle compared to normal passenger vehicles. Several road courses are considered and the performance of the developed controller in guiding the vehicle along these courses was compared against the original Stanley Controller. It was found that the optimized controller managed to improve the overall lateral error throughout the courses with 24-96% reduction in lateral error. Also, the optimization for the proposed controller was found to converge faster than its counterpart with up to 93% better solution.

AB Accurately and precisely knowing the location of the vehicle is a critical requirement for safe and successful autonomous driving. Recent studies suggest that error for map-based localization methods are tightly coupled with the surrounding environment. Considering this relationship, it is therefore possible to estimate localization error by quantifying the representation and layout of real-world phenomena. To date, existing work on estimating localization error have been limited to using self-collected 3D point cloud maps. This paper investigates the use of pre-existing 2D geographic information datasets as a proxy to estimate autonomous vehicle localization error. Seven map evaluation factors were defined for 2D geographic information in a vector format, and random forest regression was used to estimate localization error for five experiment paths in Shinjuku, Tokyo. In the best model, the results show that it is possible to estimate autonomous vehicle localization error with 69.8% of predictions within 2.5 cm and 87.4% within 5 cm.

AB Autonomous landing is a challenging phase of flight for an aerial vehicle, especially when attempting to land on a moving target. This paper presents vision-based tracking and landing of a fully-actuated tilt-augmented quadrotor on a moving target. A fully-actuated vehicle allows higher freedom in terms of control design and a larger flight envelope since the position and attitude states are decoupled. An adaptive control law is designed to track a moving target with only relative position information from a camera. Low-cost hardware is used, and experiments are carried out to validate the proposed methodology for targets moving at realistic speeds.

AB Attitude control systems for autonomous underwater vehicles are often implemented with separate controllers for pitch motion in the vertical plane and yaw motion in the horizontal plane. We propose a novel time-varying model for a streamlined autonomous underwater vehicle that explicitly displays the coupling between yaw and pitch motion due to nonzero roll angle and/or roll rate. The model facilitates the use of a multi-input multi-output H-infinity control design that is robust to yaw-pitch coupling. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated with field trials.

AB This paper describes an integrated autonomous driving (AD) control system for an autonomous vehicle with four independent in-wheel motors (IWMs). The system consists of two parts: the AD controller and the chassis controller. These elements are functionally integrated to improve vehicle stability and path tracking performance. The vehicle is assumed to employ an IWM independently at each wheel. The AD controller implements longitudinal/lateral path tracking using proportional-integral(PI) control and adaptive model predictive control. The chassis controller is composed of two lateral control units: the active front steering (AFS) control and the torque vectoring (TV) control. Jointly, they find the yaw moment to maintain vehicle stability using sliding mode control; AFS is prioritized over TV to enhance safety margin and energy saving. Then, the command yaw moment is optimally distributed to each wheel by solving a constrained least-squares problem. Validation was performed using simulation in a double lane change scenario. The simulation results show that the integrated AD control system of this paper significantly improves the path tracking capability and vehicle stability in comparison with other control systems.

AB Transport systems are increasingly featuring vehicles with autonomous capabilities. In preparation for full vehicle autonomy, governments around the world need to anticipate and prepare for a wide range of technical, social, and regulatory issues. To guide planning processes, the Australian Government commissioned an inquiry into various issues associated with the advent of driverless vehicles. The aims of the present study were to (1) document the prevalence of mentions of the major issues raised in the submissions to the Inquiry and (2) compare the types of issues raised by different categories of submitters. The written submissions and the transcriptions of the verbal submissions (n = 50) were coded to identify the nature and extent of the issues raised. Overall there was strong convergence in issues identified by submitters across the four stakeholder categories of government, research, private, and advocacy representatives. There were more perceived advantages of autonomous vehicles than disadvantages, and there was strong recognition of the potential for this new technology to save lives and provide enhanced mobility for the elderly and disabled. The results highlight areas needing greater attention to ensure the substantial potential of autonomous vehicles to benefit society is fully realized.

AB This paper presents an extended model predictive control (MPC) scheme for implementing optimal path following of autonomous vehicles, which has multiple constraints and an integrated model of vehicle and road dynamics. Road curvature and inclination factors are used in the construction of the vehicle dynamic model to describe its lateral and roll dynamics accurately. Sideslip, rollover, and vehicle envelopes are used as multiple constraints in the MPC controller formulation. Then, an extended MPC method solved by differential evolution optimization algorithm is proposed to realize optimal smooth path following based on driving path features. Finally, simulation and real experiments are carried out to evaluate the feasibility and the effectiveness of the extended MPC scheme. Results indicate that the proposed method can obtain the smooth transition to follow the optimal drivable path and satisfy the lateral dynamic stability and environmental constraints, which can improve the path following quality for better ride comfort and road availability of autonomous vehicles.

AB An autonomous vehicle driving control system carries a large number of benefits, whether for the engineering industry or engineering education. The system discussed here provides the measurements obtained from vision-namely, offset from the centerline at some look-ahead distance and the angle between the road tangent and the orientation of the vehicle at some look-ahead distance and these are directly used for control. This paper also presents simulation results regarding autonomous vehicle dynamics and control, along with methods, techniques and approaches for developing this system which can be used by engineering educators for automotive, robotics or image processing courses.

AB Free floating autonomous underwater manipulation is still an open research topic; an important challenge is offered by free floating manipulation, where the vehicle maintains relevant velocities during manipulation tasks. This paper focuses on the modelling and the control of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle for Intervention (I-AUV). To this aim, an accurate model of the I-AUV has been implemented, including the interaction with the fluid. Then, a control architecture for the whole system is proposed, with particular attention on a suitable grasp planning strategy. Finally, a free floating manipulation task has been simulated to analyse in detail the performances of the I-AUV control system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID LONGITUDINAL CONTROL; LATERAL CONTROL; SYSTEM; PLATOONS
AB This paper addresses the problem of the hybrid control of autonomous vehicles driving on automated highways. Vehicles are autonomous, so they do not communicate with each other nor with the infrastructure. Two problems have to be dealt with: a vehicle driving in a single-lane highway must never collide with its leading vehicle; and a vehicle entering the highway at a designated entry junction must be able to merge from the merging lane to the main lane, again without any collision. To solve these problems, we equip each vehicle with a hybrid controller, consisting of several continuous control laws embedded inside a finite state automaton. The automaton specifies when a given vehicle must enter the highway, merge into the main lane, yield to other vehicles, exit from the highway, and so on. The continuous control laws specify what acceleration the vehicle must have in order to avoid collisions with nearby vehicles. By carefully designing these control laws and the conditions guarding the automaton transitions, we are able to demonstrate three important results. First, we state the initial conditions guaranteeing that a following vehicle never collides with its leading vehicle. Second, we extend this first result to a lane of autonomous vehicles. Third, we prove that if all the vehicles are equipped with our hybrid controller, then no collision can ever occur, and all vehicles either merge successfully or are forced to drop out when they reach the end of their merging lane. Finally, we show the outcome of a highway microsimulation modelled after the Katy Corridor near Houston, Texas: our single-lane highway can accommodate 4000 vehicles per hour with neither drop-outs nor traffic congestion. It is entirely programmed in SHIFT, a hybrid systems simulation language developed at UC Berkeley by the PATH group. This shows that SHIFT is a well suited language for designing safe control laws for autonomous highway systems, among others. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The acceptability of autonomous vehicles is an important issue for car manufacturers. The subject of this work attempts to address this issue in the context of conflict situations in urban environments. We present the results of a preliminary study that was conducted to investigate the effects of the driving mode and context on the acceptability of the behavior of an autonomous vehicle. We thus measured acceptability on 30 drivers confronted with three driving modes (defensive, aggressive, and transgressive) as well as different situations constituted by the most common urban intersections in France. We then formulated hypotheses on the effects that the driving mode, the context, or the socio-demographic characteristics of the passengers may have on their acceptability of the autonomous vehicle behavior. In the context of our study, the driving mode of the vehicle was the most influential parameter on the level of acceptability assessed by the participants. The type of intersection used did not result in a significant difference, nor did the socio-demographic characteristics studied. The results of these works allow an interesting first approach and lead us to guide our future works on the study of the parameters involved in the driving modes of autonomous vehicles.

DE ITS; autonomous driving systems; integrated lateral and longitudinal

AB Main objectives of ITS (Intelligent Transport Systems) are to reduce traffic congestion and to prevent traffic accidents by controlling traffic flow and vehicle operations. Typical projects of autonomous driving systems were those national projects carried out in Japan, the US, and Europe from late 1980s [1-4]. However, most of the test vehicles used in these projects were passenger cars. Heavy-duty trucks and buses were rarely used due to the difficulties in realizing the expected features of actuators and the uncertainty in the construction of control systems resulting from the non-linearity of vehicle dynamics.
   This paper features an autonomous driving project, based on a linearlized model of longitudinal and lateral controlling, using a heavyduty truck equipped with advanced actuators and controllers as test vehicle. This test vehicle performs speed control by the information of onboard sensor and/or road-vehicle communications and also lane-keeping control by the information of lane marker sensors embedded on the track.
   It has been proven that the test vehicle could run stably at 60 km/h on straight line and at 40 km/h on a curvature of 60R. Details on the system constitution, the vehicle control algorithm and test results are described below.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has hastened the adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs) to minimise human-to-human contact. Yet, prior investigations suggest that AVs are accident-prone when they behave differently from humans. It is necessary to design an autonomous vehicle system (AVS) that can take human behaviour into account. This study capitalises on the wealth of data from traffic accidents caused by humans and discovers association rules to improve AVSs. Findings show that fatal accidents likely co-occur with "right near", "head on" or "lane side swipe" scenarios. They provide important implications for designing traffic scenarios that are critical for training an AVS.

AB The transportation sector is undergoing three revolutions: shared mobility, autonomous driving, and electrification. When planning the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, it is critical to consider the potential interactions and synergies among these three emerging systems. This study proposes a framework to optimize charging infrastructure development for increasing electric vehicle (EV) adoption in systems with different levels of autonomous vehicle adoption and ride sharing participation. The proposed model also accounts for the pre-existing charging infrastructure, vehicle queuing at the charging stations, and the trade-offs between building new charging stations and expanding existing ones with more charging ports.
   Using New York City (NYC) taxis as a case study, we evaluated the optimum charging station configurations for three EV adoption pathways. The pathways include EV adoption in a 1) traditional fleet (non-autonomous vehicles without ride sharing), 2) future fleet (fully autonomous vehicles with ride sharing), and 3) switch-over from traditional to future fleet. Our results show that, EV adoption in a traditional fleet requires charging infrastructure with fewer stations that each has more charging ports, compared to the future fleet which benefits from having more scattered charging stations. Charging will only reduce the service level by 2% for a future fleet with 100% EV adoption. EV adoption can reduce CO2 emissions of NYC taxis by up to 861 Tones/day for the future fleet and 1100 Tones/day for the traditional fleet.

AB Smart and autonomous vehicles are inseparable parts of the future Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, ITS components, and especially its vehicles, are prone to cyber threats. Interconnectivity of different parts, ranging from in-vehicle communication of different modules to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure message exchanges open a window to the cyber attacks launched through these communication media. This paper introduces the concept of stealth virus or worm in smart and autonomous vehicles which can jeopardize the safety of passengers. Stealth attacks are designed to manipulate a system in a way that while the changes are not detectable by human, the system is negatively influenced over the time. A framework for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is proposed afterward. The proposed IDS structure is scalable and easily deployable on current and future vehicles which are equipped with Controller Area Network (CAN) buses. Through a case study on car cruise control, a new stealth attack is presented. The attack is analytically discussed first. Then, it is shown how the proposed IDS can detect this kind of threats.

AB This paper addresses the issue of external unknown environmental interference affecting the trajectory tracking performance and driving stability of autonomous vehicles. This seriously impacts the performance and stability of the vehicle while driving. In order to provide precise, reliable, and safe trajectory tracking performance for autonomous vehicles, this paper proposes a recursive integral terminal sliding mode control (RITSMC) method. The proposed RITSMC combines the advantages of recursive integral sliding mode (RISM), terminal sliding mode (TSM), and adaptive algorithms, and can effectively achieve precise trajectory tracking and driving stability of autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, compared with traditional methods, an adaptive algorithm is introduced on the recursive sliding surface to enable real-time adaptation of the control parameters of the recursive controller, further improving the trajectory tracking accuracy and driving stability of autonomous vehicles. The stability of this control system is demonstrated by using a Lyapunov function. Finally, multiple simulation tests were conducted on different lane speeds on both wet and dry asphalt road sections. By comparing the simulation results, it was found that the proposed RITSMC exhibits excellent performance in terms of the precision of tracking trajectories and the stability of driving, in contrast to traditional sliding mode controllers (SMC) and integral terminal sliding mode controllers (ITSMC).

ID HEADWAY
AB This paper is a comparative study of the performance of constant-time-gap autonomous control systems and co-operative longitudinal control systems that use inter-vehicle communication. Analytical results show that the minimum time gap that can be achieved in autonomous control is limited by the bandwidth of the internal dynamics of the vehicle. Experimental results from typical sensors and actuators are used to show that in practice it is very difficult to achieve a time gap less than 1 s with autonomous vehicle following. This translates to an inter-vehicle spacing of 30 m at highway speeds and a theoretical maximum traffic flow of about 3000 vehicles per hour. The quality of radar range and range rate measurements pose limitations on the spacing accuracy and ride quality that can be achieved in autonomous control. Dramatic improvements in the trade-off between ride quality and spacing accuracy can be obtained merely by replacing radar range rate in the autonomous control algorithm with the difference between the measured velocities of the two cars (a rudimentary form of co-operation). As a baseline comparison, the experimental performance of fully co-operative control is presented. An inter-vehicle spacing of 6.5 m is maintained in a platoon of 8 co-operative vehicles with an excellent ride quality and an accuracy of +/-20 cm. Extending this to a 10-vehicle platoon makes it possible to achieve theoretical maximum traffic flows of about 6400 vehicles per hour.
   Another issue of importance addressed in the paper is the need to accommodate malfunctions in radar (ranging sensor) measurements. Measurement errors can occur due to hardware malfunctions as well as due to road curves, grades and the highway environment in the case of large inter-vehicle spacing. The ability of a co-operative control system to monitor the health of the radar and correct for such errors and malfunctions is demonstrated experimentally. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Steering control for path tracking in autonomous vehicles is well documented in the literature. Also, continuous direct yaw moment control, i.e., torque-vectoring, applied to humandriven electric vehicles with multiple motors is extensively researched. However, the combination of both controllers is not yet well understood. This paper analyzes the benefits of torquevectoring in an autonomous electric vehicle, either by integrating the torque-vectoring system into the path tracking controller, or through its separate implementation alongside the steering controller for path tracking. A selection of path tracking controllers is compared in obstacle avoidance tests simulated with an experimentally validated vehicle dynamics model. A genetic optimization is used to select the controller parameters. Simulation results confirm that torque-vectoring is beneficial to autonomous vehicle response. The integrated controllers achieve the best performance if they are tuned for the specific tire-road friction condition. However, they can also cause unstable behavior when they operate under lower friction conditions without any re-tuning. On the other hand, separate torque-vectoring implementations provide a consistently stable cornering response for a wide range of friction conditions. Controllers with preview formulations, or based on appropriate reference paths with respect to the middle line of the available lane, are beneficial to the path tracking performance.

AB Automatization and autonomous vehicles can drastically improve elderly drivers' safety and mobility, with lower costs to the driver and the environment. While autonomous vehicle technology is developing rapidly, much less attention and resources have been devoted to understanding the acceptance, attitudes, and preferences of vehicle automatization among driver groups, such as the elderly. In this study, 236 elderly drivers (>= 65 years) evaluated four vehicles representing SAE levels 2-5 in terms of safety, trustworthiness, enjoyment, reliability, comfort, ease of use, and attractiveness, as well as reporting preferences for vehicles employing each of the four levels of automation. The results of a repeated-measures ANOVA showed that the elderly drivers rated the SAE level 2 vehicle highest and the fully automated vehicle (SAE 5) lowest across all attributes. The preference for the vehicle declined as a function of increasing automatization. The seven attributes formed an internally coherent "attitude to automatization" scale, a strong correlate of vehicle preference. Age or annual mileage were not related to attitudes or preferences for automated vehicles. The current study shows that elderly drivers' attitudes toward automatization should be studied further, and these results should be taken into account when developing automated vehicles. The full potential of automatization may not be realized if elderly drivers are ignored.

AB Land vehicles generally rely on inertial navigation system (INS) and odometer integration system to realize high-precision autonomous navigation in a global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-denied environment. However, the navigation errors of the INS and odometer integration system will still accumulate with time due to the existence of odometer scale factor error and installation deviation angles between the INS and the odometer. To solve the problem, this article proposed an integration method, which utilizes kilometer signs to aid in correcting the navigation errors of the INS/odometer integration system. First, the absolute global positions of the kilometer signs are obtained based on image recognition and data matching. Second, the vehicle visual positioning results are obtained based on monocular camera after compensating lever arm between the kilometer sign and INS. Afterward, the vehicle positions from kilometer sign are fused by a filter to reduce the visual positioning uncertainty of the land vehicle. Finally, two Kalman filters are established to integrate the information from visual positioning, INS, and odometer. Simulation and vehicle experiment results verify the performance of the proposed method, which can improve the autonomous navigation accuracy of the land vehicle.

AB Previous research examining trust of autonomous vehicles has largely focused on holistic trust, with little work on evaluation of specific behaviours and interactions with human-controlled vehicles. Six experiments examined the influence of pull-in distance, vehicle perspective (overtaking/being overtaken), following distance and immersion on self-reported evaluations of, and physiological responses to, autonomous motorway overtakes. We found that: (i) overtake manoeuvres were viewed more positively as pull-in distance increased before reaching a plateau at approximately 28 m, (ii) physiological-based orienting responses occurred for the smallest pull-in distances, (iii) participants being overtaken were more forgiving of a sharper pull-in if the overtaking vehicle was followed closely by another vehicle, and (iv) for two of three cross-experiment comparisons participants were more forgiving of smaller pull-in distances with lower immersion levels. Overall, the results suggest that the acceptability of an overtake manoeuvre increases linearly with pull-in distance up to a set point for both overtaking and being overtaken manoeuvres, with some influence of traffic context and levels of immersion. We discuss the findings in terms of implications for the development of assisted and fully autonomous vehicle systems that perform in a way that will be acceptable to both the vehicle occupants and other road users.

AB Trajectory tracking control is a key technology in the research and development of autonomous vehicles. With the aim of addressing problems such as low control accuracy and poor real-time performance, which can occur easily when an autonomous vehicle avoids obstacles, this research focuses on the trajectory tracking control algorithm for autonomous vehicle considering cornering characteristics. First, the vehicle dynamics model and tire model are established through appropriate simplification. Then, based on the basic principle of model predictive control, a linear time-varying model predictive controller (LTV MPC) that considers the cornering characteristics is designed and optimized. Finally, using CarSim and MATLAB/Simulink software, a joint simulation model is established and the trajectory tracking performance of the controlled vehicle under different vehicle speeds and road adhesion conditions are tested through simulation experiments in combination with the double-shift line reference trajectory. The simulation results show the LTV MPC controller that considers cornering characteristics has good self-adaptability under complicated and severe working conditions, and no cases, such as car sideslip or track departure, were observed. Compared with other controllers and algorithms, the designed trajectory tracking controller has remarkable comprehensive performance, exhibits superior robustness and anti-interference ability, and significant improvements in the trajectory tracking control accuracy and real-time performance.

AB In the future, High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes or other dedicated lanes might be restricted to autonomous vehicles, e.g wirelessly connected vehicles with longitudinal motion control. These vehicles would likely travel at high speeds in platoons. New criteria for the merging of a vehicle from an adjacent freeway are proposed. To reduce disruption to the flow, only merges into gaps between platoons, not within, are considered. To minimize HOV lane trip time and vehicle deceleration, the optimal merge position is determined from simulations of linear combinations of the deviation of the headway from equilibrium and vehicle velocity differences. These are between the merging vehicle and the trailing vehicle (on the HOV lane) and the merging vehicle and the last vehicle of the preceding platoon. The merging vehicle, due to acceleration limitations on the freeway, generally will merge at a significantly lower velocity than the HOV lane average velocity. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB In static environments, safety of planned driving trajectories of (cognitive) autonomous vehicles can be assessed by checking possible collisions with the obstacles to be circumvented. In most road traffic scenarios, this approach is not sufficient, however, as the dynamics of other traffic participants has to be considered. For this purpose, the reachable road areas and the probability distribution of the positions of other traffic participants (under consideration of interaction) are computed in this work. This allows to determine the probability of a collision of the autonomous vehicle with other traffic participants, such that planned driving trajectories of the cognitive vehicle can be assessed with respect to safety.

AB A given road can be expressed mathematically in a global (or world) coordinate frame. Following the road can be substituted by following the loci of its curvature center and turning at the right circle of curvature. Considering that a vehicle in motion is always in turn about an instantaneous rotation center relative to the ground, an autonomous vehicle capable of following a given path by coinciding the rotation center of vehicle at every moment on the curvature center of the road could be designed. The dynamic reactions of the vehicle influence its path of motion and make its rotation center to depart from the desired path of the curvature center of the road. In this study, the Autodriver algorithm control strategy to front-wheel-steering vehicles has been developed and a control loop is introduced to compensate the present errors generated by the differences of the desired locating on the road and the real position of the vehicle.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB Future autonomous marine missions will depend on the seamless coordination of autonomous vehicles: unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Such coordination will enable important inter-vehicle applications such as autonomous refueling, high-throughput data transfer and periodic maintenance to extend the mission length. A critical enabling capability is the autonomous capture, retrieval and deployment of a UUV from a USV platform. As a first step toward solving this problem, we propose a performance specification that quantifies the necessary motion compensation required to safely and reliably operate a USV and UUV in concert in the dynamic marine environment. To accomplish this, we use a model-based approach to predict the motion of typical vehicles under the influence of the same sea conditions. we summarize the predictions succinctly using a scalar performance metric, the peak-to-peak vertical displacement, as a function of vehicle type, sea-state and vehicle formation.
   To substantiate this model-based approach experimentally, we present sea-trial data and compare the empirical observations to model predictions. The results show that although simple three degree-of-freedom models do not capture the full complexity of an actual six degree-of-freedom ship motion, they can prove expedient in an engineering context for quantifying the design requirements of a USV-UUV capture, deployment and retrieval system.

AB In the context of autonomous vehicles on highways, one of the first and most important tasks is to localize the vehicle on the road. For this purpose, the vehicle needs to be able to take into account the information from several sensors and fuse them with data coming from road maps. The localization problem on highways can be distilled into three main components. The first one consists of inferring on which road the vehicle is currently traveling. Indeed, Global Navigation Satellite Systems are not precise enough to deduce this information by themselves, and thus a filtering step is needed. The second component consists of estimating the vehicle's position in its lane. Finally, the third and last one aims at assessing on which lane the vehicle is currently driving. These two last components are mandatory for safe driving as actions such as overtaking a vehicle require precise information about the current localization of the vehicle. In this survey, we introduce a taxonomy of the localization methods for autonomous vehicles in highway scenarios. We present each main component of the localization process, and discuss the advantages and drawbacks of the associated state-of-the-art methods.

AB The boom seen in artificial intelligence in recent years has led to a revolution in the automotive industry. Numerous automakers around the world, such as Tesla, Toyota, Honda, and BMW, have achieved giant strides in the development of e-autonomous vehicles. Consequently, shared electric automated vehicle mobility (SEAVM) systems, which are a crucial part of future innovative transportation solutions, have attracted significant attention from the research community, particularly from a design perspective. However, the flexibility of shared automated mobility systems may lead to a self-operating technology issue (unequal distribution of vehicles), since users in these systems can pick up and drop off electric vehicles wherever they like. With this in mind, this paper addressed the issues of autonomous repositioning and the assignment of shared autonomous electric vehicle systems to balance a system's network and fulfill its demand. Modeling, analysis and assessment of the system's performance were carried out using stochastic Petri nets formalism, which included determining the average time areas were empty/congested and the number of unserved consumers, and estimating the redistribution service launch moment. Furthermore, many simulation scenarios were analyzed, including repositioning and without repositioning scenarios, in order to evaluate the efficiency of the model and to show the potential of using Petri nets as a probabilistic formalism approach for the modeling of e-automated mobility systems.

AB With rapidly developing communication and autonomous-driving technology, traffic flow on road networks will change from homogeneous human-driven vehicle (HDV) traffic flow to heterogeneous mixed traffic flow (MTF) comprising HDVs, autonomous vehicles (AVs), and connective-and-autonomous vehicles (CAVs). To understand the changes in the MTF of transportation engineering, we investigated the reserved capacity (RC) and right-of-way (ROW) reallocation policy that should be utilized under MTF scenarios. We established an MTF-based theoretical model to calculate the expressway segment capacity, theoretically analyzed the influence of the market penetration rate (MPR) on capacity and validated the model through numerical analysis. The results showed that the MPR of AVs and CAVs can enhance the MTF RC that is within 0-200% and that the platooning rate of CAVs positively influences the MTF RC. CAV popularization does not necessarily lead to a rapid increase in the transportation system efficiency when the MPR is 40%, the greatest enhancement is 4800 pcu/h/lane in terms of RC. A ROW reallocation policy that equips CAV-dedicated lanes according to the MPR of AVs and CAVs can enhance the capacity of expressway systems by 500 pcu/h/lane in terms of RC.

AB In this work, we present MapLite: a one-click autonomous navigation system capable of piloting a vehicle to an arbitrary desired destination point given only a sparse publicly available topometric map (from OpenStreetMap). The onboard sensors are used to segment the road region and register the topometric map in order to fuse the high-level navigation goals with a variational path planner in the vehicle frame. This enables the system to plan trajectories that correctly navigate road intersections without the use of an external localization system such as GPS or a detailed prior map. Since the topometric maps already exist for the vast majority of roads, this solution greatly increases the geographical scope for autonomous mobility solutions. We implement MapLite on a full-scale autonomous vehicle and exhaustively test it on over 15km of road including over 100 autonomous intersection traversals. We further extend these results through simulated testing to validate the system on complex road junction topologies such as traffic circles.

AB In order to facilitate safe and efficient interactions between autonomous vehicles (AVs) and pedestrians, lighting communication functions through extended signal forms such as light patterns and pictograms are of particular interest to express AV intentions. Currently, there is no consensus on which signal form should be used for Autonomous Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (AV2P) communications. Considering that the understandability of signal forms is crucial for the effectiveness of AV2P communications and thereby for choosing the appropriate signal form, we conducted a controlled investigation, consisting of designing forty-nine signals in the forms of light patterns and pictograms to express the vehicle yielding intention, and evaluating their performance in terms of understandability through monitor-based tests with more than five hundred online participants. It is found that, with the blank background where no external influence existed, the light patterns performed badly for correctly expressing the vehicle yielding intention but they were able to convey a warning message. The pictograms performed relatively well for expressing the yielding intention, but the diverse types of confusion were observed for those which were not well designed. With the vehicle-pedestrian encounter scenario where the vehicle yielding behaviors were explicit, the light patterns and the pictograms all performed well and the difference between them became less evident. These findings add new insights on the difference of understandability between light patterns and pictograms as available signal forms for AV2P communication functions, and are discussed in terms of usage recommendations in future road systems.

AB Shared mobility services, autonomous vehicles (AVs), and electric vehicles (EVs) are potential solutions to issues triggered by suburbanization, greenhouse gas emissions, and population aging. In this study, a shared autonomous electric vehicle (SAEV) system is proposed to create a convenient and environmentally friendly shared mobility service system based on AVs for commuters and aging users in the suburbs by exploiting the idle time of park-and-ride private vehicles in Japan. The SAEV system provides mobility services to two user groups, "inbound commuters" and "elderly and disabled residents," in two study areas. The proposed system performance was investigated using an agent-based simulation. The results show that non-EV scenarios have a better level of service owing to the improvement in average waiting time by about 20% when compared to EV scenarios which require charging. However, the SAEVs can still provide acceptable levels of mobility services. The waiting time can be maintained within 5 min when the fleet size is set at 40 trips per vehicle or less, and ride-sharing can reduce the waiting time significantly when the demand is high such as 80 trips per vehicle. Further, an average emission reduction of over 40% is anticipated when compared with the users' previous travel modes. The system managers are advised to keep the demand trips per vehicle under 40 trips/vehicle for a low waiting time (approximate 5 min or less).

AB Risk analysis/assessment is an indispensable process during the design and development of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), which is in charge of evaluating whether the risk of an attack is critical or minor. However, current risk analysis methods either are time-consuming or not suitable forConnected andAutonomous Vehicles (CAVs). In this paper, an efficient security risk analysis method, Vehicles Risk Analysis (VeRA), is proposed, fitting for evaluating the risks of attacks in the context ofAVandCAVs. VeRA firstly considers the human capabilities and vehicle automation level to conduct a security risk analysis. Meanwhile, compared to the benchmark (i.e., SAE J3061), VeRA uses a simplified analysis process and fewer factors, significantly reducing the required analysis time without affecting analysis accuracy. Moreover, based on VeRA, a simple but efficient mathematical model is established to assess the risk value by considering the attack probability, severity and human control, avoiding the tedious process of looking up tables in previousmethods. Acase study on a generalAVmodel shows thatVeRA not only captures the critical attacks as accurate as other methods, but also analyzes the changes of human controllability with the vehicle's automation level. The performance compared to other available methods shows that VeRA can obtain the same analysis results by using around 43% less time than the benchmark.

AB This paper presents a review on the development and application of model predictive control (MPC) for autonomous intelligent mechatronic systems (AIMS). Starting from the conceptual analysis of "mechatronics'', we analyze the characteristics and control system design requirements of AIMS. In order to fulfill the design requirements, we propose to develop a unified MPC framework for AIMS. The main MPC schemes, covering MPC basics, robust MPC, distributed MPC, Lyapunov-based MPC, event-based MPC, network-based MPC, switched MPC, fast MPC, are reviewed with an attempt to document some of the key achievements in the past decades. Furthermore, we provide the review and analysis of MPC applications to three types of mechatronic systems, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs), and autonomous ground robots (AGRs). Some promising research directions and concluding remarks are presented.

AB Autonomous unmanned ground vehicle is a product of technological development. At present, it has become a trend to provide multi-view real-time environmental state for autonomous unmanned ground vehicles. And more and more object detection algorithms will be applied in autonomous driving. In the recent years, multi sensor-based driving assistance systems have become a way to solve these problems. In this paper, we introduce a driving assistance system based on data fusion of multiple sensors for autonomous driving. On the one hand, six fisheye cameras and twelve ultrasonic radars are used to collect surround-view environmental state. On the other hand, this system uses a low-light camera and a lidar to provide forward-view environmental state. In the meantime, we design panoramic mosaic algorithm, surround-view data fusion algorithm and forward-view data fusion algorithm. Besides, object detection algorithm is used to provide forward-view detection results. This driving assistance system will advance research into autonomous unmanned ground vehicles.

AB This study presents an optimal variable speed limit (VSL) strategy in a connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) environment for a freeway corridor with multiple bottlenecks. The VSL control was developed by using an extended cell transmission model (CTM) which takes into account capacity decrease and mixed traffic flow, including traditional human-driven cars and heavy vehicles, and autonomous vehicles (AVs). A multiple-objective function was formulated which aims to improve the operational efficiency and smooth the speed transition. A genetic algorithm (GA) was adopted to solve the integrated VSL control problem. A real-world freeway stretch was selected to test the designed control framework. Sensitivity analyses were performed to investigate impacts of both the penetration rate of CAVs and communication range. Simulation performances demonstrated that the developed VSL control not only improves the overall efficiency but also reduces tailpipe emission rate. Simulation results also showed that the VSL control integrating vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) communication outperforms the VSL control only. In addition, as the penetration rate of CAVs increases, better performance can be achieved.

AB In recent years, research concerning autonomous driving has gained momentum to enhance road safety and traffic efficiency. Relevant concepts are being applied to the fields of perception, planning, and control of automated vehicles to leverage the advantages offered by the vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication technology. This paper presents a V2X communication-aided autonomous driving system for vehicles. It is comprised of three subsystems: beyond line-of-sight (BLOS) perception, extended planning, and control. Specifically, the BLOS perception subsystem facilitates unlimited LOS environmental perception through data fusion between local perception using on-board sensors and communication perception via V2X. In the extended planning subsystem, various algorithms are presented regarding the route, velocity, and behavior planning to reflect real-time traffic information obtained utilizing V2X communication. To verify the results, the proposed system was integrated into a full-scale vehicle that participated in the 2019 Hyundai Autonomous Vehicle Competition held in K-city with the V2X infrastructure. Using the proposed system, the authors demonstrated successful completion of all assigned real-life-based missions, including emergency braking caused by a jaywalker, detouring around a construction site ahead, complying with traffic signals, collision avoidance, and yielding the ego-lane for an emergency vehicle. The findings of this study demonstrated the possibility of several potential applications of V2X communication with regard to autonomous driving systems.

AB This paper describes the application of neurofuzzy techniques in the design of autopilots for controlling the yaw dynamics of an autonomous underwater vehicle. Autopilots are designed using an Adaptive-Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), a chemotaxis tuning methodology and a fixed fuzzy rule-based approach. To describe the yaw dynamic characteristics of an autonomous underwater vehicle, a realistic simulation model is employed. Results are presented which demonstrate the superiority of the ANFIS approach. It is concluded that the approach offers a viable alternative method for designing such autopilots.

AB As autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) enter operational service, an assessment of their reliability is timely. Using the Autosub AUV as an example, several design issues affecting reliability are discussed, followed by an analysis of recorded faults. Perhaps contrary to expectations, failures rarely involved the autonomous nature of the vehicle. Rather, faults were typical of those that occur with any complex item of marine electromechanical equipment. Reliability under various operating conditions was assessed using Weibull parametric models. This reliability modelling was extended to the case of a vehicle operating under ice in order to estimate the probability of loss in situations where the support vessel could not gain access to a malfunctioning vehicle.

AB The autonomous vehicle innovation has a potential effect on traffic and it's a widespread issue in the academic municipal. Based on its feature, autonomous vehicle is expected to improve traffic flow, reduce accidents, reduce social exclusion and improve the utility of time on travel. It is increasingly accepted that the next step to the evolution of human transportation is the replacement of human as the driver by the Artificial-intelligence-capable machine. Regardless, the challenges remain especially in convincing the consumers to switch to autonomous cars despite the apparent benefits. In the past, papers highlighted individual trust toward machine as the key point to encourage acceptance of autonomous cars. This paper seeks to highlight the ethical implications of the autonomous technology and how it is related to the user acceptance of the technology. This paper reviewed recent studies on the ethical implications of the autonomous vehicle and the user acceptance of the technology. A systematic review of papers from the literature was done using Scopus, ISI and Web of Science. The results of the review have shown that the level of trust, which may vary on the sociodemographic profile of the users, has been studied as one of the factors for user acceptance. Many researchers also highlight ethical implication as an important aspect of autonomous technology that needs to be tended to. The researcher proposes that ethical implication can be an important element of user trust toward autonomous technology. Hence, there is a need to embed ethical implication as a construct for user trust leading to user acceptance model in future studies. In the line of this research review researcher was addressed the following comprehensive groups: examination of autonomous vehicle topographies and flexibility prototypes, consequences for street traffic and connectivity to substructure (specifically in the urban areas with the medium and low density), communal attitudes and apprehensions, transportable behaviour and plea, possible business models, and strategy implications. Lastly, the main objective of this research article is to recognise critical problems for the growth of an effort cluster investigation to comprehend attitudes of possible manipulators of AVs and to highpoint autonomous vehicle growth issues for Malaysian lawful agencies.

AB A lane change is one of the most important driving scenarios for autonomous driving vehicles. This paper proposes a safe and comfort-oriented algorithm for an autonomous vehicle to perform lane changes on a straight and level road. A simplified Gray Prediction Model is designed to estimate the driving status of surrounding vehicles, and time-variant safety margins are employed during the trajectory planning to ensure a safe maneuver. The algorithm is able to adapt its lane changing strategy based on traffic situation and passenger demands, and features condition-triggered rerouting to handle unexpected traffic situations. The concept of dynamic safety margins with different settings of parameters gives a customizable feature for the autonomous lane changing control. The effect of the algorithm is verified within a self-developed traffic simulation system.

AB In this paper, a safe trajectory planning and tracking algorithm for autonomous vehicles is proposed. Specially, the safety problem considers the geometric constraints including the obstacle avoiding and the road side constraints, and the non-convex input constraints defined from the sideslip angle of the wheels and input boundedness. Control barrier function (CBF) is adopted to deal with the state and input constraints and generate nominal trajectory. For this purpose, the nominal dynamics of the autonomous vehicle is defined as the virtual dynamics, from which the CBF safety certificates are derived. By constructing appropriate feedback control, the tracking error of the actual trajectory can be bounded into a tube, which guarantees the geometric safety of the actual vehicle. Two safety certificates, the bearing and the distance safety certificates are derived for multiple-obstacle avoidance. In order to deal with the non-convex input constraints, a safe braking maneuver is carefully considered. The feasible initial velocity set for safe braking is proposed as a part of state constraints. The feasibility and the safety of the overall system is proved. The algorithm to synthesis the CBF certificates for multiple-obstacle avoidance, and the input constraints is proposed. Simulation results from an autonomous vehicle including disturbances demonstrate the feasibility of the algorithm. The software implementation of the proposed algorithm was developed in C++ intended for real-world testing.

AB Autonomous vehicles represent an emerging technology with the potential to radically transform everyday life. Yet there is little understanding of how promotional tactics-easy-to-grasp technology labels or pairing the technology with well-known celebrities-influence public perceptions of risk, benefits, and intentions. Therefore, we experimentally tested (N = 721) the effects of technology name and celebrity presence on emotional, cognitive, and behavioral responses to promotional messages. Moreover, we examined how individual differences and attention to news about autonomous vehicles can moderate responses. Results of this exploratory study revealed the importance of affective and cognitive mediators and audience-related moderators in shaping responses.

AB Recent advances in communications, controls, and embedded systems have changed the perception of a car. A vehicle has been the extension of the man's ambulatory system, docile to the driver's commands. It is now a formidable sensor platform, absorbing information from the environment (and from other cars) and feeding it to drivers and infrastructure to assist in safe navigation, pollution control, and traffic management. The next step in this evolution is just around the corner: the Internet of Autonomous Vehicles. Pioneered by the Google car, the Internet of Vehicles will be a distributed transport fabric capable of making its own decisions about driving customers to their destinations. Like other important instantiations of the Internet of Things (e.g. the smart building), the Internet of Vehicles will have communications, storage, intelligence, and learning capabilities to anticipate the customers' intentions. The concept that will help transition to the Internet of Vehicles is the vehicular fog, the equivalent of instantaneous Internet cloud for vehicles, providing all the services required by the autonomous vehicles. In this article, we discuss the evolution from intelligent vehicle grid to autonomous, Internet-connected vehicles, and vehicular fog.

AB This paper presents the autonomous swimming technology developed for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) operating in the underwater jacket structure environment. To prevent the position divergence of the inertial navigation system constructed for the primary navigation solution for the vehicle, we've developed kinds of marker-recognition based underwater localization methods using both of optical and acoustic cameras. However, these two methods all require the artificial markers to be located near to the cameras mounted on the vehicle. Therefore, in the case of the vehicle far away from the structure where the markers are usually mounted on, we may need alternative position-aiding solution to guarantee the navigation accuracy. For this purpose, we develop a sonar image processing based underwater localization method using a Forward Looking Sonar (FLS) mounted in front of the vehicle. The primary purpose of this FLS is to detect the obstacles in front of the vehicle. According to the detected obstacle(s), we apply an Occupancy Grid Map (OGM) based path planning algorithm to derive an obstacle collision-free reference path. Experimental studies are carried out in the water tank and also in the Pohang Yeongilman port sea environment to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed autonomous swimming technology.

AB One of the goals in adopting more sustainable agricultural practices is to reduce green-house-gas emissions from current practices by replacing fossil-fuel-based heavy machinery with lighter, electrical ones. In a not-so-distant scenario where a single farmer owns a fleet of small electrical tractors/robots that can operate in an autonomous/semi-autonomous manner, this will bring along some logistic challenges. It will be highly impractical that the farmer follows each time a given vehicle moves to the charging point to manually charge it. We present in this paper the design and implementation of an autonomous charging station to be used for that purpose. The charging station is a combination of a holonomic mobile platform and a collaborative robotic arm. Vision-based navigation and detection are used in order to plug the power cable from the wall-plug to the vehicle and back to the wall-plug again when the vehicle has recharged its batteries or reached the required level to pursue its tasks in the field. A decision-tree-based scheme is used in order to define the necessary pick, navigate, and plug sequences to fulfill the charging task. Communication between the autonomous charging station and the vehicle is established in order to make the whole process completely autonomous without any manual intervention. We present in this paper the charging station, the docking mechanism, communication scheme, and the deployed algorithms to achieve the autonomous charging process for agricultural electrical vehicles. We also present real experiments performed using the developed platform on an electrical robot-tractor.

AB In autonomous vehicles networks, information is transferred through vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication channels. We have added a new communication type V2IoT, which is used to communicate with internet of things devices (V2IoT) over a fifth-generation wireless system. For efficient communication, delays should be kept to a minimum and below the threshold. Increased delays may affect the performance metrics of a positioning terminal, which are characterized in terms of availability, accuracy, and integrity. Furthermore, simulation results show that scattering, reflection, and absorption weaken the signals received by vehicles or obliterate them entirely. Many untargeted transmitted signals can even interfere with other transmitted signals. This paper discusses the performance metrics for positioning terminals and proposes a new scheme based on an intelligent vehicle agent, which can reduce traffic congestion by performing seamless handoff between road sections.

AB This paper presents a methodology for observing and analyzing marine ecosystems using images gathered from autonomous marine vehicles. Visual data is composed in photo-mosaics and classified using machine learning algorithms. The approach expands existing solutions, enabling extended monitoring in time, space, and depth. Imagery was collected during a field campaign in the Spanish marine and terrestrial protected area of Cabrera, Balearic Islands, colonized by the endemic seagrass species Posidonia oceanica (Po). The operations were performed using three distinct platforms, an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) and a Lagrangian Drifter (LD).Results are compared to prior habitat maps to assess seagrass meadow distribution. The proposed solution can be scaled and adapted to other locations and species, considering limitations in data storage and battery endurance.

AB Autonomous vehicles promise to revolutionize society and improve the daily life of many, making them a coveted aim for a vast research community. To enable complex reasoning in autonomous vehicles, researchers are exploring new methods beyond traditional engineering approaches, in particular the idea of drawing inspiration from the only existing being able to drive: the human. The mental processes behind the human ability to drive can inspire new approaches with the potential to bridge the gap between artificial drivers and human drivers. In this review, we categorize and evaluate existing work on autonomous driving influenced by cognitive science, neuroscience, and psychology. We propose a taxonomy of the various sources of inspiration and identify the potential advantages with respect to traditional approaches. Although these human-inspired methods have not yet reached widespread adoption, we believe they are critical to the future of fully autonomous vehicles.

AB Recent times have seen an emergence of intelligentmachines that act autonomously on our behalf, such as autonomous vehicles. Despite promises of increased efficiency, it is not clear whether this paradigm shift will change how we decide when our self-interest (e.g., comfort) is pitted against the collective interest (e.g., environment). Here we show that acting through machines changes the way people solve these social dilemmas and we present experimental evidence showing that participants program their autonomous vehicles to act more cooperatively than if they were driving themselves. We show that this happens because programming causes selfish shortterm rewards to become less salient, leading to considerations of broader societal goals. We also show that the programmed behavior is influenced by past experience. Finally, we report evidence that the effect generalizes beyond the domain of autonomous vehicles. We discuss implications for designing autonomous machines that contribute to a more cooperative society.

TI A Decision-Making Model for Autonomous Vehicles at Urban Intersections
   Based on Conflict Resolution
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The decision-making models that are able to deal with complex and dynamic urban intersections are critical for the development of autonomous vehicles. A key challenge in operating autonomous vehicles robustly is to accurately detect the trajectories of other participants and to consider safety and efficiency concurrently into interactions between vehicles. In this work, we propose an approach for developing a tactical decision-making model for vehicles which is capable of predicting the trajectories of incoming vehicles and employs the conflict resolution theory to model vehicle interactions. The proposed algorithm can help autonomous vehicles cross intersections safely. Firstly, Gaussian process regression models were trained with the data collected at intersections using subgrade sensors and a retrofit autonomous vehicle to predict the trajectories of incoming vehicles. Then, we proposed a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) decision-making model based on efficient conflict resolution theory at intersections. After that, a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) are employed to select the optimal motions in comparison with each other. Finally, a simulation and verification platform was built based on Matlab/Simulink and PreScan. The reliability and effectiveness of the tactical decision-making model was verified by simulations. The results indicate that DDPG is more reliable and effective than NSGA-II to solve the MOP model, which provides a theoretical basis for the in-depth study of decision-making in a complex and uncertain intersection environment.

AB We study problems of intercepting single and multiple invasive intruders on a boundary of a planar region by employing a team of autonomous unmanned surface vehicles. First, the problem of intercepting a single intruder has been studied and then the proposed strategy has been applied to intercepting multiple intruders on the region boundary. Based on the proposed decentralised motion control algorithm and decision making strategy, each autonomous vehicle intercepts any intruder, which tends to leave the region by detecting the most vulnerable point of the boundary. An efficient and simple mathematical rules based control algorithm for navigating the autonomous vehicles on the boundary of the see region is developed. The proposed algorithm is computationally simple and easily implementable in real life intruder interception applications. In this paper, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a real-time solution to the considered problem of intruder interception. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by computer simulations with both single and multiple intruders.

AB To develop a realistic simulator for autonomous vehicle testing, the simulation of various scenarios that may occur near vehicles in the real world is necessary. In this paper, we propose a new scenario generation pipeline focused on generating scenarios in a specific area near an autonomous vehicle. In this method, a scenario map is generated to define the scenario simulation area. A convolutional neural network (CNN)-based scenario agent selector is introduced to evaluate whether the selected agents can generate a realistic scenario, and a collision event detector handles the collision message to trigger an accident event. The proposed event-centric action dispatcher in the pipeline enables agents near events to perform related actions when the events occur near the autonomous vehicle. The proposed scenario generation pipeline can generate scenarios containing pedestrians, animals, and vehicles, and, advantageously, no user intervention is required during the simulation. In addition, a virtual environment for autonomous driving is also implemented to test the proposed scenario generation pipeline. The results show that the CNN-based scenario agent selector chose agents that provided realistic scenarios with 92.67% accuracy, and the event-centric action dispatcher generated a visually realistic scenario by letting the agents surrounding the event generate related actions.

AB The ENDURUNS project is a European Research project of the Horizon 2020 framework, which has as its main objective to achieve the optimum and intelligent use of green hydrogen energy for long-term ocean surveys. The ENDURUNS system comprises an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) and an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) with gliding capability. The power pack of the USV integrates Li-ion batteries with photovoltaic panels, whilst the AUV employs Li-ion batteries and a hydrogen fuel cell. It is essential to develop a continuous monitoring ca-pability for the different systems of the vehicles. Data transmission between the devices onboard presents challenges due to the volume and structure of the different datasets. A telecommunications network has been designed to manage the operational components considered in the project. The autonomous vehicles perform measurements, providing their position and other data wirelessly. The system will generate a great volume of various signals during the survey. The Remote Control Centre needs to be interfaced with the vehicles in order to receive, manage and store the acquired data. An Underwater Internet of Things (IoT) platform is designed to establish efficient and smart data management. This study presents an exhaustive survey to analyse the telecommunication systems employed in the autonomous vehicles, including the back-end, user interface and mobile units. This paper presents the novel design of the hardware and software structure of the ENDURUNS project with regard to the literature, where its components and their in-terconnection layers are detailed, which is a novel scientific and technological approach for autonomous seabed surveying in deep oceans or in coastal areas.

AB Connected and Autonomous Vehicles are predicted to drive in a platoon with the aid of communication technologies to increase traffic flow efficiency while improving driving comfort, safety, fuel consumption, and exhaust emissions. However, some vehicles in a group may face communication failures. Such potential risks may even worsen the efficiency and safety of traffic flow and increase fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. Therefore, there is a need to propose an alternative scheme to control traffic flow effectively through vehicle-based information without the aid of communication technologies. In this paper, a deterministic acceleration model was developed considering the sensor's detection range to capture the underlying process of a car following the dynamics of autonomous vehicles. A delayed-feedback control was proposed based on the current and previous states of throttle angle to increase traffic flow stability and improve fuel consumption and exhaust emissions without the aid of communication technologies. Numerical simulations were carried out to study the impact of sensor detection range on micro-driving behavior and explore the effect of the proposed delayed-feedback control on the fuel consumption and exhaust emissions of autonomous vehicles in large-scale traffic flow. The numerical results certified that using delayed feedback with proper gains and delay time improved the total fuel consumption and exhaust emissions of autonomous vehicles.

AB A highly accurate and reliable vehicle position estimation system is an important component of an autonomous driving system. In generally, a global positioning system (UPS) receiver is employed for the vehicle position estimation of autonomous vehicles. However, a stand-alone UPS does not always provide accurate and reliable information of the vehicle position due to frequent UPS blockages and multipath errors. In order to overcome these problems, a sensor fusion scheme that combines the data from the UPS receiver and several on-board sensors has been studied. In previous researches, a single model filter-based sensor fusion algorithm was used to integrate information from the UPS and on-board sensors. However, an estimate obtained from a single model is difficult to cover the various driving environments, including urban areas, off-road areas, and highways. Thus, a multiple models filter (MMF) has been introduced to address this limitation by adapting multiple models to a wide range of driving conditions. An adaptation of the multiple model is achieved through the use of the model probability. The MMF combines several vehicle models using the model probabilities, which indicate the suitability of the current driving condition. In this paper, we propose a vehicle position estimation algorithm for an autonomous vehicle that is based on a neural network (NN)-based MMF. The model probabilities are determined through the NN. The proposed position estimation system was evaluated through simulations and experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed position estimation algorithm is suitable for application in an autonomous driving system over a wide range of driving conditions.

AB This article investigates the region tracking control problem for an autonomous underwater vehicle subject to external disturbances, model uncertainty, and large initial deviation. In the existing region tracking control schemes, the control signals have a serious chattering phenomenon when autonomous underwater vehicle's initial deviation is relatively large and the region tracking performance is only investigated from the position information. This article proposes an improved adaptive region tracking control scheme for autonomous underwater vehicle based on error scaling. Specifically, in the improved control scheme, the initial tracking error is artificially reduced by introducing an improved nonlinear mapping function to avoid the singular phenomenon and reduce the violent chattering phenomenon. In addition, the velocity error boundary is amplified by introducing the piecewise Lyapunov function to avoid the overadjustment of adaptive parameters in the developed controller. Meanwhile, it also reduces the frequent switching of control signals in the traditional control scheme which is caused by the pursuit of high-velocity precision. The region tracking performance is analyzed based on Lyapunov theory. Finally, the improved control scheme is applied to an autonomous underwater vehicle for simulation verification, and the comparison results demonstrate the effectiveness of the improved control scheme.

AB The limitations of underwater acoustic communications mean that the side-scan sonar data of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) cannot be transmitted back and processed in real time, which means that targets cannot be detected in real time. To address the problem, this paper proposes an autonomous underwater vehicle-based side-scan sonar real-time detection method for underwater targets. First, the paper describes the system and operation of real-time underwater-target detection by the side-scan sonar mounted on the autonomous underwater vehicle. Next, it proposes a real-time processing method for side-scan sonar data, method for constructing a deep-learning-based underwater-target detection model, and real-time method for underwater-target detection based on navigation strip images, which, together, solve the three key technical problems of real-time data processing, deep-learning-based detection model construction, and real-time target detection based on the autonomous underwater vehicle. Finally, through sea-based experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is evaluated, providing a new solution for the autonomous underwater vehicle-based side-scan sonar real-time detection of underwater targets.

ID ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL
AB Overtaking is a maneuver that consists of passing another vehicle traveling on the same trajectory, but at a slower speed. Overtaking is considered one of the most dangerous, delicate and complex maneuvers performed by a vehicle, as it requires a quick assessment of the distance and speed of the vehicle to be overtaken, and also the estimation of the available space for the maneuver. In particular, most drivers have difficulty overtaking a vehicle in the presence of vehicles coming on other trajectories. To solve these overtaking problems, this article proposes a method of performing safe, autonomous-vehicle maneuvers through the PreScan simulation program. In this environment, the overtaking-maneuver scenario (OMS) is composed of highway infrastructure, vehicles and sensors. The proposed OMS is based on the solution of minimizing the risks of collision in the presence of any oncoming vehicle during the overtaking maneuver. It is proven that the overtaking maneuver of an autonomous vehicle is safe to perform through the use of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) such as adaptive cruise control (ACC) and technology-independent sensors (TIS) that detect the driving environment of the maneuver.

AB A sustainable circular economy involves designing and promoting new products with the least environmental impact through increasing efficiency. The emergence of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has been a revolution in the automobile industry and a breakthrough opportunity to create more sustainable transportation in the future. Autonomous vehicles are supposed to provide a safe, easy-to-use and environmentally friendly means of transport. To this end, improving AVs' safety and energy efficiency by using advanced control and optimization algorithms has become an active research topic to deliver on new commitments: carbon reduction and responsible innovation. The focus of this study is to improve the energy consumption of an AV in a vehicle-following process while safe driving is satisfied. We propose a cascade control system in which an autonomous cruise controller (ACC) is integrated with an energy management system (EMS) to reduce energy consumption. An adaptive model predictive control (AMPC) is proposed as the ACC to control the acceleration of the ego vehicle (the following vehicle) in a vehicle-following scenario, such that it can safely follow the lead vehicle in the same lane on a highway. The proposed ACC appropriately switches between speed and distance control systems to follow the lead vehicle safely and precisely. The computed acceleration is then used in the EMS component to find the optimal engine torque that minimizes the fuel consumption of the ego vehicle. EMS is designed based on two methods: type 1 fuzzy logic system (T1FLS) and interval type 2 fuzzy logic system (IT2FLS). Results show that the combination of AMPC and IT2FLS significantly reduces fuel consumption while the ego vehicle follows the lead vehicle safely and with a minimum spacing error. The proposed controller facilitates smarter energy use in AVs and supports safer transportation.

AB Autonomous vehicles become more and more popular in our daily life. Mobile computing schemes to be installed on these vehicles have drawn a lot of recent research interest. In this paper, we address the important path-planning problem for autonomous vehicles. We introduce and formulate the novel paintbrush coverage problem. We present a theoretical study on the minimum trajectory length of a paintbrush to cover an arbitrary convex region, which is derived as a function of the area of the region and the size of the cover. Three commonly-used patrolling/scouting methods, namely boustrophedon, spiral, and sector, are manifested in details as the potential solutions to the paintbrush coverage problem. The theoretical minimum trajectory lengths any algorithm can achieve are also demonstrated as the benchmarks for different shapes of regions.

AB A connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) is often fitted with a large number of onboard sensors and applications to support autonomous driving functions. Based on the current research, little work on applications' access to in-vehicle data has been done. Furthermore, most existing autonomous driving operating systems lack authentication and encryption units. As such, applications can excessively obtain confidential information, such as vehicle location and owner preferences and even upload it to the cloud, threatening the security of the vehicle and the privacy of the owner. In this study, we propose a fine-grained access control scheme to restrict applications' access to data in CAVs (FGAC-inCAVs). First, we present a system model composed of the following elements: a trusted third party (TTP), which is a fully trusted authority; perception components like sensors, which can capture the road information (pictures, videos, etc.); and multiple applications. Then, a fast attribute-based encryption (ABE) is presented, and security analysis also shows it is secure against selective and chosen-plaintext attacks. Furthermore, we propose a key update scheme based on the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT). Finally, the theoretical analysis and simulation experiments demonstrate its feasibility and efficiency.

AB The purpose of this paper is to elaborate the transport geography of electric and autonomous vehicles for road freight transport and establish a research agenda by identifying many unresolved issues already beginning to emerge. While regulatory approval for full coverage on all roads remains some years away, autonomous vehicles are already operating intermodal-style main hauls on major highways, interchanging at highway junctions with the first and last mile performed by regular trucks. Meanwhile, electric trucks capable of medium distances on a single charge are now entering the market. The two technologies of electric propulsion and autonomy are mutually reinforcing, particularly from the network perspective, and purpose-built electric autonomous vehicles (EAVs) are starting to enter commercial service.
   This paper utilises an analytical framework of intermodal transport to map against the emerging geography of EAVs and determine how our knowledge of the features, challenges, business models and policy implications of intermodal transport can help decision makers plan for a better development of the emerging EAV network. The paper provides recommendations for policymakers dealing with arising challenges and identifies a list of research questions regarding this rapidly evolving new form of transport.

AB Recent technological advancements in computer vision algorithms and data acquisition devices have greatly facilitated the research and applications of deep learning-based traffic object recognition from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. The majority of existing methodologies applied deep learning (DL)-based techniques, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for vehicle detection and tracking on autonomous driving datasets. Nevertheless, fewer studies were focused on DL-based vehicle detection using roadside LiDAR data, partially due to the lack of publicly available roadside LiDAR datasets for network training and testing. This paper develops a novel framework based on CNNs and LiDAR data for automated vehicle detection. It leverages the domain knowledge of CNNs trained on large-scale autonomous driving datasets for vehicle detection from roadside LiDAR data. In the experimental study, roadside LiDAR data were collected at a road intersection in Reno, Nevada, U.S. Meanwhile, a CNN architecture was proposed to detect vehicles from LiDAR data through 3D bounding boxes. The proposed CNN was modified from the established PointPillars network by adding dense connections to the convolutional layers to achieve more comprehensive feature extraction. Three CNNs, including the proposed CNN, PointPillars, and YOLOv4, were trained and tested on PandaSet, a publicly available large-scale autonomous driving LiDAR dataset. Subsequently, the trained CNNs were reused for vehicle detection from the captured roadside LiDAR data. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed CNN outperformed the others in the testing metrics. All three networks showed good performance on vehicle detection from the captured roadside LiDAR data.

AB The interest in autonomous driving has continuously increased in the last two decades. However, to be adopted, such critical systems need to be safe. Concerning the perception of the ego-vehicle environment, the literature has investigated two different types of methods. On the one hand, traditional analytical methods generally rely on handcrafted designs and features while on the other hand, learning methods aim at designing their own appropriate representation of the observed scene.

AB The future Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are likely to be electric. We started with a review of the adoption of AVs, Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Autonomous Electric Vehicles (AEVs), as well as the six associated urban sub-systems, namely transportation, land use, environment, energy, economy, and population systems, in order to find evidence about the linkages and interactions between the diffusion of AEVs and the six sub-systems. Based on the review, we argued that an integrated urban model, which takes the linkages and interactions into account, was needed to fully understand the adoption and impacts of AEVs. Furthermore, we conducted a conceptual design of an integrated model for AEVs (without explicit modelling), and demonstrated how to update an existing agent-based Land Use and Transport Interaction (LUTI) model by incorporating AEV components. The resulting integrated model of AEVs would help different AEV-related stakeholders (e.g., local authorities) in their decision-making.

AB In recent years, the development and testing of autonomous driving technology have become widespread around the world. However, due to differences in perception abilities between autonomous vehicles and human drivers, the current geometric design controls for highway alignments, designed for the human driver, may not be applicable to the autonomous vehicle (AV). Few studies, however, have systematically investigated the design controls for autonomous vehicles, though we face full driving automation in the next few decades. Because the range of modern AV sensors reaches 250 m, with expected further improvements in the near future, there is a need to determine how the sensors' perception field and perception-reaction time may affect the current road design standards developed for human drivers. This study therefore tested the feasibility of the current design controls for fully-autonomous vehicles by separately computing controls for vertical alignments and combined horizontal and vertical alignments, considering the AV's perception abilities of perception-reaction time (PRT), sensor height, and upward angle from the horizontal. The required stopping sight distance (SSD) and minimum length of sag and crest vertical curves were derived and compared with those for human drivers. Computations for combined alignments were based on Green Book coordination guidelines: as the minimum length of horizontal curve can be used for alignments adhering to guidelines, preview sight distance (PVSD) was computed for alignments that do not. Results showed that 1) AV-based design controls on vertical curves were more tolerant than those based on human drivers; and 2) the dominating criterion of sag vertical curve design control was comfort for autonomous vehicles, versus required SSD for human drivers.

AB High market penetration of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and connected-autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is expected to impact transportation network performance, which is an important determinant of residential location decisions, especially for households who commute to work by personal vehicle. This study examines and compares the impacts of privately owned AVs and CAVs on the location and commute characteristics as well as the spatial distribution of households within the Triangle Region in North Carolina. A Mixed Multinomial Logit model is developed using recent household survey data to capture household preferences. In addition, the region's travel demand model, the Triangle Regional Model, is used to predict the network-level impacts of AV and CAV adoption, and cluster analysis is conducted to explore how network performance changes vary with transportation demand and supply zone characteristics at a local and regional level. Residential location patterns are predicted for a number of AV and CAV scenarios for the year 2045 using the outputs of the econometric analysis and the Triangle Regional Model. We find that extensive adoption of private CAVs improves network conditions and encourages households to live farther from work, leading up to a 5.6% increase in suburban and rural households that commute to work by personal vehicles. A high market share of AVs is associated with deteriorated transportation network performance and up to a 2.8% increase in urban households. Results vary by market penetration rate of each technology, mix of AVs, CAVs, and human driven vehicles in the traffic stream, and fuel type (conventional-fuel versus electric vehicles).

AB The development and deployment of autonomous vehicles is inseparable from the questions about the future development of cities. Urban governance is vital in ensuring the viability, effectiveness and safety of the next generation urban mobility services, and various roles taken on by cities are pivotal for the creation and maintenance of markets for autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we examine how urban governance approaches for autonomous vehicles development and deployment in the United States are evolving within multi-scalar regulatory contexts. We conceptualize the various types of engagements by cities through four different roles: city as regulator, mediator, data catalyst, and promoter. These categories are not mutually exclusive, but complementary, and are intended to support the development of appropriate models as cities continue to evaluate options for their urban mobility futures. We present two illustrative examples, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Boston, Massachusetts, to analyze how cities vary in their approaches to the new urban mobility sector. These are two of the leading municipalities in the United States on autonomous vehicle testing and deployment, and their experiences are helpful to elucidating the variety of regulatory contexts, approaches to governance, and potential outcomes.

AB Merge scenarios confront drivers with some of the most complicated driving maneuvers in every day driving, requiring anticipatory reasoning of positions of other vehicles, and the own vehicles future trajectory. In congested traffic it might be impossible to merge without cooperation of up-stream vehicles, therefore, it is essential to gauge the effect of our own trajectory when planning a merge maneuver. For an autonomous vehicle to perform a merge maneuver in congested traffic similar capabilities are required. This includes a model describing the future evolution of the scene that allows for optimizing the autonomous vehicle's planned trajectory with respect to risk, comfort, and dynamical limitations. We present a probabilistic model that explicitly models interaction between vehicles and allows for evaluating the utility of a large number of candidate trajectories of an autonomous vehicle using a receding horizon approach in order to select an appropriate merge maneuver. The model is an extension of the intelligent driver model and the modeled behavior of other vehicles are adjusted using online model parameter estimation in order to give better predictions. The prediction model is evaluated using naturalistic traffic data and the merge maneuver planner is evaluated in simulation.

AB With the recent advances and development of autonomous control systems of cars, the design and development of reliable infrastructure and communication networks become a necessity. The recent release of the fifth-generation cellular system (5G) promises to provide a step towards reliability or a panacea. However, designing autonomous vehicle networks has more requirements due to the high mobility and traffic density of such networks and the latency and reliability requirements of applications run over such networks. To this end, we proposed a multilevel cloud system for autonomous vehicles which was built over the Tactile Internet. In addition, base stations at the edge of the radio-access network (RAN) with different technologies of antennas are used in our system. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed system with multilevel clouding can significantly reduce the round-trip latency and the network congestion. In addition, our system can be adapted in the mobility scenario.

AB Different types of autonomous vehicles vary in design manufacturing and technical performance, and there are many uncertainties and inaccuracies in the selection process. How to select a safe and efficient autonomous vehicles becomes a great challenge nowadays. This article addresses a selection problem of autonomous vehicles by building an uncertainty model in multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM). The evaluation infor-mation is described by the proportional hesitant 2-tuple linguistic term set (PH2TLTS). Based on the axiomatic definition of entropy, a comprehensive entropy measure corresponding to PH2TLTS is constructed and combined with the entropy weighting method to determine the attribute weights. In addition, a PH2TLTS comparison method is proposed on the basis of symbolic function and distance measure, which can not only determine the priorities between PH2TLTSs, but also indicate the degree to which PH2TLTS is greater (or less) than another. Combining Elimination Et Choix Traduisant la Realite ' (ELECTRE) III, the selection of autonomous vehicles is obtained by the proposed proportional hesitant 2-tuple linguistic ELECTRE (PH2TL-ELECTRE) III model. Finally, the case study, sensitivity analyses, comparative analysis are undertaken for verifying reasonableness and feasibility of the presented model.

AB Objectives: The substantial public health benefits of autonomous vehicles will be optimised once all vehicles operate in autonomous mode. This form of disruptive technology will need to be widely accepted by the community to facilitate the regulatory and behavioural adjustments required to achieve rapid adoption. The aim of this study was to assess: i) receptiveness to autonomous vehicles; ii) the salience of various health benefits (e.g. crash prevention, emission reduction, driving stress reduction, cyclist safety, increased mobility for those unable to drive); and iii) prompted awareness of these health benefits. Methods: Quantitative and qualitative data were generated via a national online survey of a broad range of Australians aged 16 years and over (n=1,624). Results: There were neutral levels of receptiveness and very low salience of health benefits, but more substantial levels of prompted awareness of positive health outcomes. Conclusions: These results suggest that the public may be interested in information relating to the individual and societal health benefits of autonomous vehicles, which in turn may increase overall support for this innovation. Implications for public health: Australians are likely to be receptive to autonomous vehicles when provided with information relating to their public health benefits.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) are proving to be a promising platform design for multidisciplinary autonomous operability with a wide range of applications in marine ecology and geoscience. Here, two novel contributions towards increasing the autonomous navigation capability of a new AUV prototype (the Guanay II) as a mix between a propelled vehicle and a glider are presented. Firstly, a vectorial propulsion system has been designed to provide full vehicle maneuverability in both horizontal and vertical planes. Furthermore, two controllers have been designed, based on fuzzy controls, to provide the vehicle with autonomous navigation capabilities. Due to the decoupled system propriety, the controllers in the horizontal plane have been designed separately from the vertical plane. This class of non-linear controllers has been used to interpret linguistic laws into different zones of functionality. This method provided good performance, used as interpolation between different rules or linear controls. Both improvements have been validated through simulations and field tests, displaying good performance results. Finally, the conclusion of this work is that the Guanay II AUV has a solid controller to perform autonomous navigation and carry out vertical immersions.

AB This work presents a specific application of a novel map representation, the Hybrid Metric Map. This representation allows a consistent autonomous localization and simultaneously the synthesis of a detailed description of the environment where the robot or vehicle operates. There are many applications where an autonomous vehicle senses environment properties that are not necessarily used for the localization process. Precision agriculture is a special case of this. The proposed algorithm is able to fuse a large amount of information for the environment description and simultaneously estimate the vehicle position.

AB In this paper, we present control laws for an autonomous vehicle with rigidly mounted range sensors to track a boundary curve. In particular, we consider a vehicle that has a group of rays close to one center ray that has an arbitrary fixed angle to the heading of the vehicle. To achieve robust tracking performance in noisy environments, we present sliding mode based controllers. Also, switching control laws are developed to avoid singularities in control laws. Rigorous proof and extensive simulation results verify the validity and robustness of our control laws.

AB A robust H infinity observer-based static state-feedback controller is designed for the path following of autonomous ground vehicles in this paper. Considering the lateral velocity of vehicle is usually difficult to measure, an observer is designed to estimate the value of lateral velocity first. Then, a robust controller is proposed to cope with the modeling uncertainty and disturbance, such as the variation of road coefficient and lateral disturbance. Numerical simulations using a high-fidelity and full-vehicle model based on a CarSim-Simulink joint platform have verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB All developed economies mandate at least third party auto insurance resulting inW a vast global liability industry. The evolution towards semi-autonomous and eventually driverless vehicles will progressively remove the leading cause of vehicle accidents, human error, and significantly lower vehicle accident rates. However, this transition will force a departure from existing actuarial methods requires careful management to ensure risks are correctly assigned. Personal motor insurance lines are anticipated to diminish as liability shifts towards OEMs, tier 1 and 2 suppliers and software developers. Vehicle accident risks will hinge on vehicular characteristics in addition to driver related risks as drivers alternate between autonomous and manual driving modes. This paper proposes a Bayesian Network statistical risk estimation approach that can accommodate changing risk levels and the emergence of new risk structures. We demonstrate the use of this method for a Level 3 semi-autonomous vehicle for two scenarios, one where the driver is in control and one where the vehicle is in control. This approach is especially suited to use telematics data generated from the vehicle inherent technologies. We validate the efficacy of this approach from the perspective of the insurer and discuss how vehicle technology development will require a greater degree of collaboration between the insurance company and the manufacturers in order to develop a greater understanding of the risks semiautonomous and fully autonomous vehicles.

AB This paper introduces the development of an autonomous driving system in autonomous electric vehicles, which consists of a simplified motion-planning program and a Model-Predictive-Control-Based (MPC-based) control system. The motion-planning system is based on polynomial parameterization, which computes a path toward the expected longitudinal and lateral positions within required time interval in real scenarios. Then the MPC-based control system cooperates the front steering and individual wheel torques to track the planned trajectories, while fulfilling the physical constraints of actuators. The proposed system is evaluated through simulation, using a seven-degrees-of-freedom vehicle model with a magic formula' tire model. The simulations and validation through CarSim show that the proposed planner algorithm and controller are feasible and can achieve requirements of autonomous driving in normal scenarios.

AB Safe handling of dynamic inner-city scenarios with autonomous road vehicles involves the problem of stabilization of precalculated state trajectories. In order to account for the practical requirements of the holistic autonomous system, we propose two complementary nonlinear Lyapunov-based tracking-control laws to solve the problem for speeds betwee +/- 6 m/s. Their designs are based on an extended kinematic one-track model, and they provide a smooth, singularity-free stopping transient. With regard to autonomous test applications, the proposed tracking law without orientation control performs much better with respect to control effort and steering-input saturation than the one with orientation control but needs to be prudently combined with the latter for backward driving. The controller performance is illustrated with a full-size test vehicle.

AB The impact of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on urban mobility systems is an increasingly discussed topic in recent years. There is currently some discussions about different ownership models and their consequences. Regarding autonomous vehicles (AVs), two ownership models are being considered for future transportation systems. These are: autonomous vehicles as a public service or individual owning ownership. The first ownership model is based on AVs operating within an on-demand (taxi) service while the second proposes private vehicle ownership combined with offering the AV to other users when not used by its owner and thereby partially financing the vehicle's acquisition cost. In addition to the ownership model comes the possibility of sharing rides. The main difference when sharing a trip is that an individually-owned vehicle always prioritizes its owner. Based on an existing approach for assessing the potential of predefined meeting points in a ride-sharing service, we develop a method for assessing the sharing potential of those different variants. We consider the number and distance of shared trips, and thus, we evaluate the potentially saved vehicle kilometers. We analyze several ownership and sharing scenarios on a case study for New York and Paris. The results demonstrate that sharing AV trips has the potential of increasing the system-wide matching rate as well as saving up to 25% of the overall traveled distance.

ID EMPATHY
AB Unlike hypothetical trolley problem studies and an ongoing ethical dilemma with autonomous vehicles, road users can face similar ethical dilemmas in real life. Swerving a heavy vehicle towards the road-side in order to avoid a head-on crash with a much lighter passenger car is often the only option available which could save lives. However, running off-road increases the probability of a roll-over and endangers the life of the heavy vehicle driver. We have created an experimental survey study in which heavy vehicle drivers randomly received one of two possible scenarios. We found that respondents were more likely to report they would ditch their vehicle in order to save the hypothetical driver who fell asleep than to save the driver who deliberately diverted their car towards the participant's heavy vehicle. Additionally, the higher the empathy score, the higher the probability of ditching a vehicle. Implications for autonomous vehicle programming are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Autonomous vehicles mitigate road accidents and provide safe transportation with a smooth traffic flow. They are expected to greatly improve the quality of the elderly or people with impairments by improving their mobility due to the ease of access to transportation. Autonomous vehicles sense the driving environment and navigate through it without human intervention. And, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is witnessed as a powerful machine learning solution to address a sequential decision problem in autonomous vehicles. The detailed state-of-the-art work in autonomous vehicles using DRL algorithms along with future research directions is discussed. Due to the high dimensional action space, two continuous action space DRL algorithms: Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are chosen to address the complex autonomous driving problem. The proposed DDPG and PPO based decision-making models are trained and tested using the TORC simulator. Both the algorithms are trained for the same number of episodes for lane keeping as well as multi-agent collision avoidance scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to present the comparative performance analysis of these two algorithms, and DDPG is found to perform better in terms of higher reward and faster convergence than PPO. Hence, DDPG is a suitable option in the design of a decision model for autonomous driving.

AB Autonomous vehicles are becoming an essential tool in a wide range of environmental applications that include ambient data acquisition, remote sensing, and mapping of the spatial extent of pollutant spills. Among these applications, pollution source localization has drawn increasing interest due to its scientific and commercial interest and the emergence of a new breed of robotic vehicles capable of operating in harsh environments without human supervision. The aim is to find the location of a region that is the source of a given substance of interest (e.g. a chemical pollutant at sea or a gas leakage in air) using a group of cooperative autonomous vehicles. Motivated by fast paced advances in this challenging area, this paper surveys recent advances in searching techniques that are at the core of environmental monitoring strategies using autonomous vehicles.

AB Large fluctuation, large overshoot, and uncertain external disturbance that occur when an autonomous underwater vehicle is in deep motion are difficult to address using the traditional control method. An optimal control strategy based on an improved active disturbance rejection control technology is proposed to enhance the trajectory tracking accuracy of autonomous underwater vehicles in actual bathymetric operations and resist external and internal disturbances. First, the depth motion and mathematical models of an autonomous underwater vehicle and propeller are established, respectively. Second, the control rate of the extended state observer and the nonlinear error feedback of the traditional active disturbance rejection control are improved by using a new nonlinear function. The nonlinearity, model uncertainty, and external disturbance of the autonomous underwater vehicle depth control system are extended to a new state, which is realized by an improved extended state observer. Third, the improved nonlinear state error feedback is used to suppress residual errors and provide high-quality control for the system. Simulation and experimental results show that under the same parameters, the traditional active disturbance rejection control has a small overshoot, fast tracking ability, and strong anti-interference ability. The optimized active disturbance rejection control and traditional active disturbance rejection control are applied to the deep-variation motion of autonomous underwater vehicles. Results show that the proposed optimal control strategy is not only simple and feasible but also demonstrates good control performance.

AB This paper presents energy-efficient guidance strategies of autonomous surface vehicles for a long endurance mission where station keeping (also known as dynamic positioning) is required to keep the vehicle at a fixed point or within the specified area. A small size vehicle with two thrusters is considered, which is underactuated and can be greatly affected by environmental effects such as wind, wave, and currents. Several station keeping algorithms are proposed including the vector field approach and the variation of conventional dynamic positioning approaches. Their performance in terms of fuel consumption is compared by numerical simulations with both ideal and realistic environmental conditions.

AB This paper investigates the energy management system (EMS) of a conventional autonomous vehicle, with a view to enhance its powertrain efficiency. The designed EMS includes two neuro-fuzzy (NF) systems to produce the optimal torque of the engine. This control system uses the dynamic road power demand of the autonomous vehicle as an input, and a PID controller to regulate the air mass flow rate into the cylinder by changing the throttle angle. Two NF systems were trained by the Grid Partition (GP) and the Subtractive Clustering (SC) methods. The simulation results show that the proposed EMS can reduce the fuel consumption of the vehicle by 6.69 and 6.351/100 km using the SC and the GP, respectively. In addition, the EMS based on NF trained by GP and NF trained by SC can reduce the fuel consumption of the vehicle by 11.8% and 7.08% compared with the case without the controller, respectively.

ID SIMULATION ANALYSIS
AB In this paper, we propose a game theory based approach to decision making with application to the operation of autonomous ground vehicles in highway setting. The mixed-motive game theory is utilised as a decision-making strategy in the context of a two-player game involving autonomous vehicles. The payoff matrices are defined by considering the safety of each player's decision combination in view of their desire to stay within a given lane or to change lanes in consideration of the traffic conditions that the vehicles encounter. By analysing the payoff matrix, either a pure (deterministic) strategy or a mixed (probabilistic) strategy is selected. Three 10 km velocity profiles are predefined for simulation purposes. The simulation results demonstrate effective driving performance. In particular when it is compared with non-game theory cases, game theory based results show larger payoff for both vehicles and smaller payoff differences, securing safe manoeuvring via lane change manoeuvre (LCM) and adaptive cruise control (ACC).

AB The localization of autonomous vehicles using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors relies on high-definition (HD) maps, which are essential for accurate positioning. However, the large storage capacity required for HD maps poses challenges for real-time performance. To address this issue, we propose a vehicle to infrastructure (V2I)-based LiDAR localization method. In this approach, real-time HD maps are transmitted to vehicles in the vicinity of the infrastructure, enabling localization without the need for map data. We conducted tests to determine the optimal size of the HD maps and the distance between vehicles and the infrastructure, considering the impact on transmission speed. Additionally, we compared the matching performance between the complete HD map and sub maps received from the infrastructure, to evaluate the effectiveness of our method in a qualitative manner.

AB We propose two model-based threat assessment methods for semi-autonomous vehicles, i.e., human-driven vehicles with autonomous driving capabilities. Based on information about the surrounding environment, we introduce a set of constraints on the vehicle states, which are satisfied under "safe" driving conditions. Then, we formulate the threat assessment problem as a constraint satisfaction problem. Vehicle and driver mathematical models are used to predict future constraint violation, indicating the possibility of accident or loss of vehicle control, hence, the need to assist the driver. The two proposed methods differ in the models used to predict vehicle motion within the surrounding environment. We demonstrate the proposed methods in a roadway departure application and validate them through experimental data.

Based on the co-simulation of Python and SUMO, establishing a model of on-ramp merge driving behaviour of autonomous vehicles based on non-cooperative static game. Under this model, the experiment results that the average speed in the merging area is increased by 12.7%, the standard deviation of the average speed is reduced by 35.46%, and the number of the vehicles successfully merged before the end of the merging area is 4.86 times that of traditional method, indicate that the model can effectively help the vehicles be merged and improve the traffic efficiency to a certain extent.

AB Autonomous vehicle guidance and trajectory planning is one of the key technologies in the autonomous control system for intelligent vehicles. Firstly, the target pursuit model for intelligent vehicles was established and described in this text. Then, the research work for global motion planning was carried out based on Stackelberg Differential Game Theory, and the global optimal solution was obtained by using the survival type differential game. Finally, to overcome errors, we use a polynomial method to achieve the smooth motion planning. So, based on Terminal Sliding Mode method, the Active Front Steering controller design was used to calculate the desired active wheel angle for intelligent vehicle path tracking. The simulation and experiment results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this method for intelligent vehicles' path planning and tracking.

AB Crossroads are the main traffic jam generators in densely populated cities. Unmanned vehicles and intelligent transportation systems can significantly reduce congestion and improve road safety by eliminating the main cause of traffic accidents-the human factor. However, full confidence in their safety is necessary. This paper addresses the contextual data integrity problem, when an unmanned autonomous vehicle transmits incorrect data due to technical problems, or malicious attacks. We propose an approach based on trust and reputation that allows detecting vehicles transmitting bogus data. To verify the feasibility of the approach on practice, we conducted both software and physical simulations using the model of intersection and unmanned autonomous vehicle models. The simulation results show that the approach applied allows detecting vehicles with bogus data and excluding them from the group, thus increasing the safety of the intersection traversal by other vehicles.

AB Recently, the spectrum band beyond 60 GHz has attracted attention with the growth of traffic demand. Previous studies assumed that these bands are not suitable for vehicle communications due to the short range and high rate of blockage. However, it also means that there is no existing service or regulation designed for these bands, which makes this area free to apply. Therefore, in this article, we draw a potential map of THz vehicle transmission for autonomous vehicles to break the blockage of short-range and unstable links. First, we give a brief overview of possible waveforms followed by the specific channel at 0.1-1 THz. Then we propose an autonomous relay algorithm called ATLR for the gigabit-level communication in the high-speed road environment. Finally, we discuss how the THz transmission helps relieve the interference problem and provide extra data to support various instructions in autonomous vehicles.

AB Autonomous intersection management (AIM) is a type of intersection control for autonomous vehicles which eliminates the need for a traffic signal by using vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. Vehicles communicate information to an intersection manager which determines vehicle ordering and spacing so that vehicles can pass safely through the intersection. Reservation-based AIM, which gives vehicles space-time path reservations through an intersection, has the potential to greatly increase the capacity of intersections by allowing an intersection controller to optimize the path that each vehicle takes. A mixed-integer linear program is proposed which gives the intersection manager more flexibility through optimizing vehicle acceleration and velocity through the intersection. This model was integrated with microsimulation software and various scenarios were simulated, including fluctuating the vehicle demands, altering the permitted vehicle accelerations and speeds, and modifying the safety buffer between vehicles. The results indicate that the model proposed in this study has the capability to reduce delay and increase average speed experienced by vehicles compared with the existing reservation-based intersection control formulations and conventional signal controls.

AB Automation represents the next big buzz in transport and promises many advantages beneficial for society, including a more efficient use of space, energy, time, as well as reduced costs. An impressive range of autono-mous vehicles is introduced, covering applications for personal and goods transport. In particular in response to the global pandemic linked to COVID-19, autonomous vehicles were proposed and celebrated as safe and reliable home delivery solutions of the future. In the midst of visionary trend reports, eye-catching press releases and promising research simulations, the actual applicability of autonomous vehicles in an e-commerce context re-mains difficult to assess. This lack of clarity holds for delivery automation in ordinary situations as well as in exceptional circumstances, such as those presented by a severe health crisis. To understand the state of practice and future potential of autonomous vehicles for e-commerce delivery in cities, we carried out desk and field research on the topic. This article structures the different types of autonomous e-commerce delivery vehicles and scenarios and discusses their state of practice and potential in ordinary as well as in exceptional circumstances. The study focusses on France, against a comprehensive international backdrop.

AB Lateral tracking is a fundamental technology for autonomous vehicles, particularly in narrow and complex scenes such as parking lots and alleys, where precise control is critical. To enhance the efficacy and precision of the traditional Pure Pursuit algorithm (PP) in the lateral tracking of low-speed autonomous vehicles, this study proposes a continuous adaptive piecewise fitting method based on the cubic Bezier curve to smooth the reference path, followed by a search for the look-ahead point based on the geometric relationship between the vehicle and the reference path. An improved search algorithm based on vehicle speed and road curvature is used to identify the look-ahead point. In case of significant changes in the reference path curvature, the initially obtained look-ahead point is modified. The proposed Improve Pure Pursuit Method (IPP) is then used to calculate the steering angle of the front wheel. To validate the proposed method, the Carsim/Simulink co-simulation model and the autonomous vehicle platform are established. The simulation and real-vehicle tests demonstrate that compared with the pure pursuit algorithm based on Vehicle speed control (VPP) and Fuzzy Logic control pure Pursuit (FPP), IPP performs better in complex low-speed lateral tracking scenes. It reduces the issue of cutting corners when the vehicle enters a corner and enhances lateral tracking accuracy.

AB Autonomous vehicles face challenges in ensuring cyber-physical security due to their reliance on image data from cameras processed by machine learning. These algorithms, however, are vulnerable to anomalies in the imagery, leading to decreased recognition accuracy and presenting security concerns. Current machine learning models struggle to predict unexpected vehicular situations, particularly with unpredictable objects and unexpected anomalies. To combat this, scholars are focusing on active inference, a method that can adapt models based on human cognition. This paper aims to incorporate active inference into autonomous vehicle systems. Multiple studies have delved into this approach, showing its potential to address security gaps in this field. Specifically, these frameworks have proven effective in handling unforeseen vehicular anomalies.

AB A current autonomous vehicle determines its driving strategy by considering only external factors (Pedestrians, road conditions, etc.) without considering the interior condition of the vehicle. To solve the problem, this paper proposes "An Optimal Driving Support Strategy(ODSS) based on an Genetic Algorithm for Autonomous Vehicles" which determines the optimal strategy of an autonomous vehicle by analyzing not only the external factors, but also the internal factors of the vehicle(consumable conditions, RPM levels etc.). The proposed ODSS consists of 4 modules. The first module is a Data Communication Module (DCM) which converts CAN, FlexRay, and HSCAN messages of vehicles into WAVE messages and sends the converted messages to the Cloud and receives the analyzed result from the Cloud using V2X. The second module is a Data Management Module (DMM) that classifies the converted WAVE messages and stores the classified messages in a road state table, a sensor message table, and a vehicle state table. The third module is a Data Analysis Module (DAM) which learns a genetic algorithm using sensor data from vehicles stored in the cloud and determines the optimal driving strategy of an autonomous vehicle. The fourth module is a Data Visualization Module (DVM) which displays the optimal driving strategy and the current driving conditions on a vehicle monitor. This paper compared the DCM with existing vehicle gateways and the DAM with the MLP and RF neural network models to validate the ODSS. In the experiment, the DCM improved a loss rate approximately by 5%, compared with existing vehicle gateways. In addition, because the DAM improved computation time by 40% and 20% separately, compared with the MLP and RF, it determined RPM, speed, steering angle and lane changes faster than them.

AB A scheduling scheme for autonomous intersection crossing is proposed and evaluated. The scheduling scheme determines the flow of autonomous vehicles into an intersection without traffic signals. The objective of the scheduling scheme is to schedule the vehicles' entrances into the intersection such that there will be no collision among vehicles and the intersection is efficiently utilized. Our scheduling scheme uses reservation-based scheduling approach, and the scheduling is formulated as an optimization problem to find the best sequence of vehicles' entrances into the intersection. Our scheme is made more practical by allowing the vehicles to move at any speed within a speed range, and it is shown that it is fast enough to be used in real time. Through simulation, it is also shown that our scheduling scheme significantly outperforms the first-come, first-served approach, which is the approach used by other reservation-based scheduling schemes.

AB Oceanic autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) are one kind of autonomous marine robots that have advantages of energy saving and is flexible to use. Nowadays, ASVs are playing an important role in marine science, maritime industry, and national defense. It could improve the efficiency of oceanic data collection, ensure marine transportation safety, and protect national security. One of the core challenges for ASVs is how to plan a safe navigation autonomously under the complicated ocean environment. Based on the type of marine vehicles, ASVs could be divided into two categories: autonomous sailboats and autonomous vessels. In this article, we review the challenges and related solutions of ASVs' autonomous navigation, including modeling analysis, path planning and implementation. Finally, we make a summary of all of those in four tables and discuss about the future research directions.

AB This paper investigates public perceptions towards potential safety benefits, and safety and security-related concerns from the future use of autonomous vehicles by utilizing data collected from an online survey. The survey includes responses from 584 individuals from the United States, who responded to a varying range of questions related to autonomous vehicles and their usage. The subsequent exploratory statistical analysis is conducted by employing a novel method, namely the grouped random parameters bivariate probit model with heterogeneity in means. The proposed method accounts for the challenges stemming from the presence of multiple layers of unobserved heterogeneity in the data, and simultaneously offers more insightful results. From the analysis, several socio-demographic characteristics, and driving attitude related characteristics and opinions were found to affect the perceptions towards the safety and security related aspects of autonomous vehicles. The heterogeneity in means approach revealed distinct individual-specific characteristics that affect the peak of the distribution of the parameter density function of the random parameters, adding further clarity to the understanding of the factors affecting individuals' perceptions towards autonomous vehicles. The findings from this study suggest the ongoing evaluation of public perceptions, and reinforce the requirement of analyzing temporal variations in public perceptions. This can, in turn, aid regulatory and governance entities and autonomous vehicle manufacturers to adapt their strategies and implementation plans accordingly. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The cohesiveness of autonomous cooperative system is the basis of achieving the effective communication and cooperation among the multiple vehicles. Therefore, the biosphere mechanism of queen mandibular pheromone is used for reference in this paper, to abstract the macro motion characteristic of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles autonomous cooperative tracking system. Then, some Lyapunov functions are constructed to analyze the stability of this system, thus obtaining its judgment criterion of stability. Finally, the simulation is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed stable mechanism. The results show that the proposed stable mechanism not only can ensure the stability of autonomous cooperative system, but also can control the scale of this system effectively by adapting some relevant control parameters.

AB Multi-object detection and multi-object-tracking in diverse driving situations is the main challenge in autonomous vehicles. Vehicle manufacturers and research organizations are addressing this problem, with multiple sensors such as camera, LiDAR, RADAR, ultrasonic-sensors, GPS, and Vehicle-to-Everything-technology. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are playing a predominant role to solve this. Fusing the sensing modalities with DNN will be the leading solution to this challenge. This paper evaluates the state-of-the-art techniques that address this challenge, with three primary sensors camera, LiDAR, and RADAR with DNN, and fusion of sensor data with DNN. The analysis shows that there exists an excellent potential to design a more optimized solution to address this challenge. This work proposes a perception model for autonomous vehicles.

AB Handling of critical situations is an important part in the architecture of an autonomous vehicle. A controller for autonomous collision avoidance is developed based on a wary strategy that assumes the least tire-road friction for which the maneuver is still feasible. Should the friction be greater, the controller makes use of this, and performs better. The controller uses an acceleration-vector reference obtained from optimal control of a friction-limited particle, whose applicability is verified by using numerical optimization on a full vehicle model. By employing an analytical tire model of the tire-road friction limit, to determine slip references for steering, and body-slip control, the result is a controller where the computation of its output is explicit, and independent of the actual tire-road friction. When evaluated in real-time on a high-fidelity simulation model, the developed controller performs close to that achieved by offline numerical optimization.

AB In this paper, we present a mathematical model and adaptive controller for an autonomous vehicle overtaking maneuver. We consider the problem of an autonomous three-phase overtaking without the use of any roadway marking scheme or intervehicle communication. The developed feedback controller requires information for the current relative intervehicle position and orientation, which are assumed to be available from onboard sensors. We apply standard robotic nomenclature for translational and rotational displacements and velocities and propose a general kinematic model of the vehicles and the relative intervehicle kinematics during the overtaking maneuver. The overtaking maneuver is investigated as a tracking problem with respect to desired polynomial virtual trajectories for every phase, which are generated in real time. An update control law for the automated overtaking vehicle is designed that allows tracking the desired trajectories in the presence of unknown velocity of the overtaken vehicle. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed controller.

AB This paper proposes a coordinated control strategy that considers torque vectoring control (TVC) and path following system (PFS) for autonomous vehicles with four in-wheel motors. Firstly, a non-linear vehicle state observer based on UniTire tyre model is proposed to estimate longitudinal and lateral speed. Then the sideslip angle and tyre slip ratio can be obtained. Secondly, a lateral and longitudinal path following algorithm using the driver model based on optimal preview theory and PI controller is established. For the vehicle safety control of autonomous driving, a layered control scheme is proposed, in which the upper layer employs an adaptive second-order sliding mode controller (ASOSM) to get additional yaw moment. Finally, simulation test results prove that the proposed state observation and coordinated control algorithm is valid.

AB On underwater towed systems, the towing cable plays an important role in transmitting electric signals and towing forces. Hence, it is strongly recommended to monitor the towed force for preventing cable breaks and making use of it more efficiently; however, most existing underwater towed systems do not have such a capability. This paper discusses towed force monitoring and control for safe operation of an autonomous towed vehicle that is a kind of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). We first overview the autonomous towed vehicle and describe our related previous works. We then present our towed force measuring and monitoring manners and an experimental methodology for obtaining the feasible range of the towed force. In addition, towed force estimation only with vehicle dynamics is presented for the case when the towed force sensor became useless. Finally, we discuss towed force control to keep the towed force inside its feasible region. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This letter studies the problem of autonomous navigation for unmanned underwater vehicles, using computer vision for localization. Parallel tracking and mapping is employed to localize the vehicle with respect to a visual map, using a single camera, whereas an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used to fuse the visual information with data from an inertial measurement unit, in order to recover the scale of the map and improve the pose estimation. A proportional integral derivative controller controller with compensation of the restoring forces is proposed to accomplish trajectory tracking, where a pressure sensor and a magnetometer provide feedback for depth control and yaw, respectively, while the remaining states are provided by the EKF. Real-time experiments are presented to validate the navigation strategy, using a commercial remotely operated vehicle (ROV), the BlueROV2, which was adapted to perform as an autonomous underwater vehicle with the help of the robot operative system.

TI Potential risk assessment for safe driving of autonomous vehicles under
   occluded vision
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB This study aimed to explore how autonomous vehicles can predict potential risks and efficiently pass through the dangerous interaction areas in the face of occluded scenes or limited visual scope. First, a Dynamic Bayesian Network based model for real-time assessment of potential risks is proposed, which enables autonomous vehicles to observe the surrounding risk factors, and infer and quantify the potential risks at the visually occluded areas. The risk distance coefficient is established to integrate the perception interaction ability of traffic participants into the model. Second, the predicted potential risk is applied to vehicle motion planning. The vehicle movement is improved by adjusting the speed and heading angle control. Finally, a dynamic simulation platform is built to verify the proposed model in two specific scenarios of view occlusion. The model has been compared with the existing methods, the autonomous vehicles can accurately assess the potential danger of the occluded areas in real-time and can safely, comfortably, and effectively pass through the dangerous interaction areas.

AB In this paper a robust image processing method with modified Otsu algorithm to recognize the road lane for a real-time controlled autonomous vehicle is presented. The main objective of a proposed method is to drive an autonomous vehicle safely irrespective of road image qualities. For the steering of real-time controlled autonomous vehicle, a detection area is predefined by lane segment, with previously obtained frame data, and the edges are detected on the basis of a lane width. For stable as well as psudo-robust autonomous driving with "good", "shady" or even "bad" road profiles, the variable threshold with modified Otsu algorithm in the image histogram, is utilized to obtain a binary image from each frame. Also Hough transform is utilized to extract the lane segment. Whether the image is "good", "shady" or "bad", always robust and reliable edges are obtained from the algorithms applied in this paper in a real-time basis. For verifying the adaptability of the proposed algorithm, a miniature vehicle with a camera is constructed and tested with various road conditions. Also, various highway road images are analyzed with proposed algorithm to prove its usefulness.

AB This paper presents a path planning algorithm for autonomous vehicles to generate feasible and smooth maneuvers in unstructured environments. Our approach uses a graph-based search algorithm and a discrete kinematic vehicle model to find a primitive path that is non-holonomic, collision-free, and safe. The algorithm then improves the quality and smoothness of the identified path by making local shortcuts. This shortcut for smoothing the path is determined by connecting the internal state of the primitive path to the initial state based on the Pythagorean Hodograph (PH) cubic curve. The formulation of the PH cubic curves in the smoothing path provides arc-length parameterization of the curve in a closed form. We present examples and experimental results for the real time path planning in unstructured road from an implementation on an autonomous vehicle.

AB Numerous developments in technology toward autonomous vehicle systems (AVSs) have been performed for so many years all over the world. As our day-to-day life is becoming progressively dependent on automation vehicle system and control devices, the craze on automation advancements is expected to move closer through scientific technologies like artificial intelligence and robotics. From another point of view, the cyber threat to the AVS causes drastic accidents and traffic congestion by varying the speed differences among the vehicles. To overcome such shortcomings, this paper presented a convolutional neural network-oppositional-based Henry gas solubility optimization (CNN-OHGS) algorithm for an autonomous vehicle control system to enhance the robustness of the vehicle. At the same time, the attackers attempt to embed the faulty or defective data into the sensor readings of the autonomous vehicle to interrupt the optimal distances among the automated vehicles. Therefore to minimize such issues, our proposed framework employs the CNN-OHGS algorithm to reduce the distance variations among the vehicles thus ensuring the safety and optimal distance variation. Finally, the experimental analysis is conducted and the performance evaluation for various attacks, FID evaluation, and remorse function, and distance deviation for all sensor signal attacks are evaluated. The comparative analysis is made and we can clearly state that the proposed work has outperformed other existing approaches.

The MiniCity is a 1/10th scale city consisting of realistic urban scenery, intersections, and multiple fully autonomous 1/10th scale vehicles with state-of-the-art sensors and algorithms. The MiniCity is used to evaluate and test perception algorithms both upstream and downstream in the autonomy stack, in urban driving scenarios such as occluded intersections and avoiding multiple vehicles. We demonstrate the MiniCity's ability to evaluate different sensor and algorithm configurations for perception tasks such as object detection and localization. For both tasks, the MiniCity platform is used to evaluate the task itself (accuracy in estimating obstacle pose and ego pose in the map) as well as the downstream performance in collision avoidance and lane following, respectively.

AB The emergence of autonomous vehicles and the advancement of technology over the past several decades has increased the demand for intelligent intersection management systems. Since there has been increased interest in researching how autonomous vehicles manage traffic at junctions, a thorough literature analysis is urgently needed. This study discovered peer-reviewed publications published between 2012 and 2022 in the most prestigious libraries to address this problem. After that, 100 primary studies were identified, and the chosen literature was subjected to systematic analysis. According to the findings, there are four primary categories of approaches, i.e., rule-based, optimization, hybrid, and machine learning procedures, which are used to achieve diverse driving objectives, including efficacy, safety, ecological, and passenger ease. The analyses illustrate the many attributes, limits, and views of the current solutions. This analysis enables the provision of potential future difficulties and directions in this study area.

AB Interest in autonomous driving (AD) and intelligent vehicles (IVs) is growing at a rapid pace due to the convenience, safety, and economic benefits. Although a number of surveys have reviewed research achievements in this field, they are still limited in specific tasks, lack of systematic summary and research directions in the future. Here we propose a Survey of Surveys (SoS) for total technologies of AD and IVs that reviews the history, summarizes the milestones, and provides the perspectives, ethics, and future research directions. To our knowledge, this article is the first SoS with milestones in AD and IVs, which constitutes our complete research work together with two other technical surveys. We anticipate that this article will bring novel and diverse insights to researchers and abecedarians, and serve as a bridge between past and future.

AB The vision-based localization of rotor unmanned aerial vehicles for autonomous landing is challenging because of the limited detection range. In this article, to extend the vision detection and measurement range, a hierarchical vision-based localization method is proposed for unmanned aerial vehicle autonomous landing. In such a hierarchical framework, the landing is defined into three phases: Approaching,Adjustment, and Touchdown, in which visual artificial features at different scales can be detected from the designed object pattern for unmanned aerial vehicle pose recovery. The corresponding feature detection and pose estimation algorithms are also presented. In the end, typical simulation and field experiments have been carried out to illustrate the proposed method. The results show that our hierarchical vision-based localization has the ability to a consecutive unmanned aerial vehicle localization in a wider working range from far to near, which is significant for autonomous landing.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
DE autonomous vehicle; lane keeping; path generation; steering control
AB This paper presents a steering control method for lane-following in a vehicle using an image sensor. With each image frame acquired from the sensor, the steering control method determines target position and direction, and constructs a travel path from the current position to the target position either as an Arc-path or S-path. The steering angle is calculated from the travel path thus generated, and the vehicle follows the travel path via motor-control. The method was tested using a vehicle dubbed as KAV (Korea Autonomous Vehicle) along an expressway (Seoul Inner Beltway) trajectory with a variety of radii (50 m similar to 300 m) while traveling at a speed of 60 km/h to 80 km/h. Compared with an experienced human driver, the method showed little much difference in performance in terms of lane-center deviation. The proposed method is currently employed for high speed autonomous driving as well as for stop and go traffic.

AB Autonomous vehicles are an emerging technology that can fundamentally change how our society moves and lives. We review the infant literature of 185 peer-reviewed articles on the social context of an AV-enabled mobility future. We develop a taxonomy based on sociomobility that illustrates how AVs reinforce the status-quo in our society as AV-mobility is primarily defined as an auto issue and not a mobility question. Absent from the literature are alternate mobility scenarios, land-use interactions, livability, the transition period when both AVs and human drivers occupy road space, and impacts on the natural environment.

AB One of the main features of autonomous control systems is solving complicated optimization problems without human intervention in the presence of uncertainty in real time [1]. Autonomous systems (ASs) must have the recognition and discretion potency, evaluation and estimate authority, and decision-making power to independently perform various tasks in a dynamic environment [3]. These systems have a variety of sensors to understand environmental information so that they can distinguish, evaluate, and make decisions based on them [2]. In addition to an autonomous single-agent system, the AS can be designed in the form of multiagents to identify high-risk, hazardous, or inaccessible areas [3], [4]. Robotics and AS fields have led to significant advances in a wide range of areas, including unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), unmanned maritime vehicles (UMVs), artificial intelligence (AI), and self-learning machines [5]. Navigation [6], [7], 3-D path following [8] for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), AUVs for oceanographic research [9], and rescue robots [10] have benefited from the development of autonomy.

AB With the increasing challenges in last mile logistics, a variety of promising approaches of autonomous delivery concepts have been emerging in recent years. Due to the fast pace of advancements, several approaches have been developed, the characterization of them often by purpose rather than systematically. This study builds upon a multi-stage research process that includes a systematic literature review and structured taxonomy building process, as well as a hierarchical cluster analysis of 45 existing autonomous delivery concepts. Based on that, two main results were achieved. First, a holistic taxonomy with 13 categories - including technological, process-related and customer acceptance characteristics - was developed to achieve characterizing of autonomous delivery concepts in a standardized way. The second result centered on the taxonomy, where four clusters could be identified through the hierarchical cluster analysis. With the developed clusters it is possible to better categorize and compare individual autonomous delivery concepts.

AB Recently, we have experienced an incredible surge of interest in connected and autonomous vehicles and related enabling technologies, which are expected to revolutionize future Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). This surging demand and popularity of ITS with the Internet of Vehicles technology has led to a tremendous rise in the number of connected vehicles. Driven by this massive number of connected vehicles, and the stringent requirements of autonomous vehicles and data-intensive applications such as ultralow latency, high reliability, and high security, intelligent transportation systems are rapidly moving to the 6G networks. The 6G-supported ITS is expected to be a transformative factor for both society and the economy by delivering unprecedented, seamless, reliable, efficient massive connectivity to millions of users and connected vehicles.

DE Underwater intervention; Autonomous manipulation; Localization;

AB Many underwater intervention tasks are today performed using manned submersibles or remotely operated vehicles in teleoperation mode. Autonomous underwater vehicles are mostly employed in survey applications. In fact, the low bandwidth and significant time delay inherent in acoustic subsea communications represent a considerable obstacle to remotely operate a manipulation system, making it impossible for remote controllers to react to problems in a timely manner.
   Nevertheless, vehicles with no physical link and with no human occupants permit intervention in dangerous areas, such as in deep ocean, under ice, in missions to retrieve hazardous objects, or in classified areas. The key element in underwater intervention performed with autonomous vehicles is autonomous manipulation. This is a challenging technology milestone, which refers to the capability of a robot system that performs intervention tasks requiring physical contacts with unstructured environments without continuous human supervision.
   Today, only few AUVs are equipped with manipulators. SAUVIM (Semi Autonomous Underwater Vehicle for Intervention Mission, University of Hawaii) is one of the first underwater vehicle capable of autonomous manipulation.
   This paper presents the solutions chosen within the development of the system in order to address the problems intrinsic to autonomous underwater manipulation. In the proposed approach, the most noticeable aspect is the increase in the level of information transferred between the system and the human supervisor.
   We describe one of the first trials of autonomous intervention performed by SAUVIM in the oceanic environment. To the best knowledge of the authors, no sea trials in underwater autonomous manipulation have been presented in the literature. The presented operation is an underwater recovery mission, which consists in a sequence of autonomous tasks finalized to search for the target and to securely hook a cable to it in order to bring the target to the surface.

AB Navigation algorithms for autonomous vehicles have become the subject of increasing interest, but most of them heavily rely on expensive high-precision positioning equipment, which hinders autonomous vehicles' development. In this article, we propose a path planning and control framework for autonomous vehicles with low-cost positioning. For the path planning layer, a potential field is constructed by the potential functions of road boundaries, obstacles, and reference waypoints. According to the potential field, a reinforcement learning agent is developed to generate a collision-free path for path tracking. For the control layer, a model predictive control based on vehicle dynamics is designed and a linear terminal constraint is considered. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively avoid static and dynamic obstacles. Moreover, compared with traditional methods, the proposed algorithm performs better when the positioning devices are imprecise. Furthermore, the real-time performance can meet the requirements of navigation.

AB We present a closed-loop approach to solve the semi-autonomous nonholonomic vehicle-parking assistant problem. The method allows for a priori unknown and potentially high vehicle speeds and dynamic environment variations. The computationally low-cost, memory-efficient algorithm respects constraints on the steering angle and its first two derivatives, allowing for comfortable, safe, and smooth steering motions. A parking situation is captured by an arrangement of precalculated vector fields of feasible nonholonomic paths, by which the vehicle is controlled toward a desired goal configuration inside a parking bay. Using standard onboard environment perception sensors, the system adapts to changes in the environment and avoids collisions whenever possible, without aborting a parking procedure.

AB In recent years, path-tracking controllers for autonomous passenger vehicles and Control Allocation (CA) methods for handling and stability control have both received extensive discussion in the literature. However, the integration of the path-tracking control with CA methods for autonomous racing vehicles has not attracted much attention. In this study, we design an integrated path-tracking and CA method for a prototype autonomous racing electric vehicle with a particular focus on the maximising the turning speed in tight cornering. The proposed control strategy has a hierarchical structure to improve the computational efficiency: the high-level path-tracking Model Predictive Control (MPC) based on a rigid body model is designed to determine the virtual control forces according to the desired path and desired maximum velocity profile, while the low-level CA method uses a Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming (QCQP) formulation to distribute the individual control actuator according to the desired virtual control values. The proposed controller is validated in a high-fidelity simulation vehicle model with the computational time of the optimisation controller presented to demonstrate the real-time control performance.

AB Research on cooperation and control among autonomous vehicles is in the vanguard of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Some examples are the intersection manoeuvres, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), and overtaking, among others. Overtaking requires special attention in dynamic environments, especially when there is a vehicle coming from the other direction on a two-way road. In this paper a decision algorithm, a communication system among three vehicles and a fuzzy logic control, to implement the overtaking manoeuvre are explained. Different use cases has been considered, they evaluate if to finish or to abort in a safe way the overtaking manoeuvre. The results show a good performance of the fuzzy control based in human knowledge for high risk manoeuvres. Copyright (C) 2010 CEA.

AB An approach to real-time trajectory generation for platoons of autonomous vehicles is developed from well-known control techniques for redundant robotic manipulators. The partially decentralized structure of this approach permits each vehicle to independently compute its trajectory in real-time using only locally generated information and low-bandwidth feedback generated by a system exogenous to the platoon. Our work is motivated by applications for which communications bandwidth is severely limited, such for platoons of autonomous underwater vehicles. The communication requirements for our trajectory generation approach are independent of the number of vehicles in the platoon, enabling platoons composed of a large number of vehicles to be coordinated despite limited communication bandwidth.

AB Autonomous driving is a promising technology to reduce traffic accidents and improve driving efficiency. In this work, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-enabled decision-making policy is constructed for autonomous vehicles to address the overtaking behaviors on the highway. First, a highway driving environment is founded, wherein the ego vehicle aims to pass through the surrounding vehicles with an efficient and safe maneuver. A hierarchical control framework is presented to control these vehicles, which indicates the upper-level manages the driving decisions, and the lower-level cares about the supervision of vehicle speed and acceleration. Then, the particular DRL method named dueling deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm is applied to derive the highway decision-making strategy. The exhaustive calculative procedures of deep Q-network and DDQN algorithms are discussed and compared. Finally, a series of estimation simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed highway decision-making policy. The advantages of the proposed framework in convergence rate and control performance are illuminated. Simulation results reveal that the DDQN-based overtaking policy could accomplish highway driving tasks efficiently and safely.

AB One of the critical tasks required for fully autonomous functionality is the ability to achieve an accurate navigation solution; that is, to determine the platform position, velocity, and orientation. Various sensors, depending on the vehicle environment (air, sea, or land), are employed to achieve this goal. In parallel to the development of novel navigation and sensor fusion algorithms, machine-learning based algorithms are penetrating into the navigation and sensor fusion fields. An excellent example for this trend is pedestrian dead reckoning, used for indoor navigation, where both classical and machine learning approaches are used to improve the navigation accuracy. To facilitate machine learning algorithms' derivation and validation for autonomous platforms, a huge quantity of recorded sensor data is needed. Unfortunately, in many situations, such datasets are not easy to collect or are not publicly available. To advance the development of accurate autonomous navigation, this paper presents the autonomous platforms inertial dataset. It contains inertial sensor raw data and corresponding ground truth trajectories. The dataset was collected using a variety of platforms including a quadrotor, two autonomous underwater vehicles, a land vehicle, a remote controlled electric car, and a boat. A total of 805.5 minutes of recordings were made using different types of inertial sensors, global navigation satellite system receivers, and Doppler velocity logs. After describing the sensors that were employed for the recordings, a detailed description of the conducted experiments is provided. The autonomous platform inertial dataset is available at: https://github.com/ansfl/Navigation-Data-Project/.

AB Ant colony algorithm or artificial potential field is commonly used for path planning of autonomous vehicle. However, vehicle dynamics and road adhesion coefficient are not taken into consideration. In addition, ant colony algorithm has blindness/randomness due to low pheromone concentration at initial stage of obstacle avoidance path searching progress. In this article, a new fusion algorithm combining ant colony algorithm and improved potential field is introduced making autonomous vehicle avoid obstacle and drive more safely. Controller of path planning is modeled and analyzed based on simulation of CarSim and Simulink. Simulation results show that fusion algorithm reduces blindness at initial stage of obstacle avoidance path searching progress and verifies validity and efficiency of path planning. Moreover, all parameters of vehicle are changed within a reasonable range to meet requirements of steering stability and driving safely during path planning progress.

AB An integrated longitudinal-lateral control method is proposed for autonomous vehicle trajectory tracking and dynamic collision avoidance. A method of obstacle trajectory prediction is proposed, in which the trajectory of the obstacle is predicted and the dynamic solution of the reference trajectory is realized. Aiming at the lane changing scene of autonomous vehicles driving in the same direction and adjacent lanes, a trajectory re-planning motion controller with the penalty function is designed. The reference trajectory parameterized output of local reprogramming is realized by using the method of curve fitting. In the framework of integrated control, Fuzzy adaptive (proportional-integral) PI controller is proposed for longitudinal velocity tracking. The selection and control of controller and velocity are realized by logical threshold method; A model predictive control (MPC) with vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) information interaction modular and the driver characteristics is proposed for direction control. According to the control target, the objective function and constraints of the controller are designed. The proposed method's performance in different scenarios is verified by simulation. The results show that the autonomous vehicles can avoid collision and have good stability.

AB Autonomous vehicles differ from many other autonomous systems in the sense that these vehicles have to share the environment with humans (e.g., pedestrians, cyclists, and other drivers in traffic). This requirement poses a challenging perception and planning problem. Our research focuses on the problem of a vehicle sharing the environment with a human passenger/driver and, specifically, of designing a controller that captures the natural tendencies of the human driver so as to guarantee that the resulting control action is comparable to that of the human. In this paper, we propose to use a human driver control model into the autonomous vehicle control framework, which has previously been shown to predict short-term driver actions, and we develop an approach that reliably and accurately estimates input-feature values from driver-point-of-view images. After the feature-input values have been estimated, the human driver control model computes the corresponding steering-wheel angle. We, thus, provide more structure to the overall processing pipeline, compared to the recent end-to-end approaches. The proposed approach is validated using numerical simulations with synthetic images. The results validate the importance of combining traditional structured (e.g., transfer function) models with parsimonious neural-network representations.

AB The simplified vehicle model often results in inaccuracy with respect to the conventional model predictive control (MPC) as it causes steady error in tracking control, which has negative implications for vehicle cornering. This study presents a trajectory planning and tracking framework, which applies artificial potential to obtain target trajectory and MPC with PID feedback to effectively track planned trajectory. The experimental and simulation results are then presented to demonstrate the improved performance in tracking accuracy and steering smoothness compared to that of the conventional MPC control. Especially during negotiating a curve, its steady state error is close to 0.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB It is expected that a mixture of autonomous and manual vehicles will persist as a part of the intelligent transportation system (ITS) for many decades. Thus, addressing the safety issues arising from this mix of autonomous and manual vehicles before autonomous vehicles are entirely popularized is crucial. As the ITS system has increased in complexity, autonomous vehicles exhibit problems such as a low intention recognition rate and poor real-time performance when predicting the driving direction; these problems seriously affect the safety and comfort of mixed traffic systems. Therefore, the ability of autonomous vehicles to predict the driving direction in real time according to the surrounding traffic environment must be improved and researchers must work to create a more mature ITS. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based traffic safety solution for a mixture of autonomous and manual vehicles in a 5G-enabled ITS. In this scheme, a driving trajectory dataset and a natural-driving dataset are employed as the network inputs to long-term memory networks in the 5G-enabled ITS: the probability matrix of each intention is calculated by the softmax function. Then, the final intention probability is obtained by fusing the mean rule in the decision layer. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves intention recognition rates of 91.58% and 90.88% for left and right lane changes, respectively, effectively improving both accuracy and real-time intention recognition and improving the lane change problem in a mixed traffic environment.

AB This paper presents a model predictive controller (MPC) structure for solving the path-tracking problem of terrestrial autonomous vehicles. To achieve the desired performance during high-speed driving, the controller architecture considers both the kinematic and the dynamic control in a cascade structure. Our study contains a comparative study between two kinematic linear predictive control strategies: The first strategy is based on the successive linearization concept, and the other strategy combines a local reference frame with an approaching path strategy. Our goal is to search for the strategy that best comprises the performance and hardware-cost criteria. For the dynamic controller, a decentralized predictive controller based on a linearized model of the vehicle is used. Practical experiments obtained using an autonomous "Mini-Baja" vehicle equipped with an embedded computing system are presented. These results confirm that the proposed MPC structure is the solution that better matches the target criteria.

AB This article addresses the problem of lateral control problem for networked-based autonomous vehicle systems. A novel solution is presented for nonlinear autonomous vehicles to smoothly follow the planned path under external disturbances and network-induced issues, such as cyber-attacks, time delays, and limited bandwidths. First, a fuzzy-model-based system is established to represent the nonlinear networked vehicle systems subject to hybrid cyber-attacks. To reduce the network burden and effects of cyber-attacks, an asynchronous resilient event-triggered scheme (ETS) is proposed. A dynamic output-feedback control method is developed to address the underlying problem. Conditions are derived to obtain the output-feedback controller and resilient asynchronous ETS such that the closed-loop switched fuzzy system is globally exponentially stable. Examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed new control design techniques.

AB There are various kinds of autonomous vehicles (AV's) which can operate with varying levels of autonomy. This paper is concerned with underwater ground, and aerial vehicles operating in a fully autonomous (nonteleoperated) mode, Further, this paper deals with AV's as a special kind of device, rather than full-scale manned vehicles operating unmanned. The distinction is one in which the AV is likely to be designed for autonomous operation rather than being adapted for it as would be the case for manned vehicles.
   We provide a survey of the technological progress that has been made in AV's, the current research issues and approaches that are continuing that progress, and the applications which motivate this work. It should be noted that issues of control are pervasive regardless of the kind of AV being considered hut that there are special considerations in the design and operation of AV's depending an whether the focus is on vehicles underwater, on the ground, or in the air. We have separated the discussion into sections treating each of these categories.

In this paper, we demonstrate the valuable contribution of decision support systems that combine data-driven analytics and simulation techniques in understanding complex systems such as urban transportation. Using the city of Berlin as a case study, we show that shared, autonomous electric vehicles can substantially reduce resource investments while keeping service levels stable. Our findings inform stakeholders on the trade-off between economic and sustainability-related considerations when fostering the transition to sustainable urban mobility.

AB With the advent of autonomous driving technologies, traffic control at intersections is expected to experience revolutionary changes. Various novel intersection control methods have been proposed in the existing literature, and they can be roughly divided into two categories: vehicle-based traffic control and movement-based traffic control. Movement-based traffic control can be treated as updated versions of the current intersection signal control with the incorporation of the performance of autonomous vehicle functions. Meanwhile, vehicle-based traffic control utilizes some brand-new methods, mostly in real-time fashion, to organize traffic at intersections for safe and efficient vehicle passages. However, to date, no systematic comparison between these two control categories has been performed to suggest their advantages and disadvantages. This paper conducts a series of numerical simulations under various traffic scenarios to perform a fair comparison of their performances. Specifically, we allow trajectory adjustments of incoming vehicles under movement-based traffic control, while for its vehicle-based counterpart, we implement two strategies, i.e., the first-come-first-serve strategy and the optimization-based strategy. Overall, the simulation results show that vehicle-based traffic control generally incurs a negligible delay when traffic demand is low but lead to an excessive queuing time as the traffic volume becomes high.

AB Purpose This paper proposes the computational modeling of a lateral and longitudinal action Model Predictive Control (MPC) controller to immediately control and correct the steering system of an autonomous/intelligent vehicle considered robust during its displacement. Methods and Results The control is defined by the input variable delta (steering system) and projected by the MPC controller considering input and output restrictions, the mathematical model of the vehicle steering system and experimental parameters are set to validate vehicular steering control regarding its precision and safety. The configuration of the vehicle system block diagram and simulations were performed with the aid of Matlab/Simulink software. Conclusions The results of the computational simulations are represented by the output variables (lateral position Y and yaw angle psi) that positively validates the MPC to take over the steering and braking of a preferably autonomous vehicle in in situations of sudden longitudinal and lateral movements and in front of obstacles. The linear and discrete answers presented classify the MPC controller as robust.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL
AB Autodriver algorithm aims to develop a path-following algorithm for autonomous vehicles using road geometry data and vehicle dynamics. In this study, a novel smart Autodriver algorithm is developed according to practical implications utilizing a more realistic vehicle model and consideration of real-time applicability. A ghost-car path-following approach is introduced to define the desired location of the vehicle at every instance during various maneuvers. Key steady-state characteristics of turning vehicles, namely the curvature, yaw rate, and side-slip responses are discussed and used to construct a path-following controller based on the Autodriver algorithm. A feedback control based on Sliding Mode Control (SMC) is also designed and applied to minimize transient errors between the road and the vehicle positions. Finally, simulations are performed to analyze the path-following performance of the proposed scheme compared to a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) as a widely accepted popular method for autonomous vehicles. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests are also performed to investigate real-time applicability of the controllers. The results show promising controller performance in terms of error minimization, passenger comfort, and low computational cost for the proposed method.

ID YAW-MOMENT CONTROL; CONTROL-SYSTEM; ELECTRIC VEHICLE
AB A pre-emptive braking control method is proposed to improve the stability of autonomous vehicles during emergency collision avoidance, aiming to imitate the realistic human driving experience. A linear model predictive control is used to derive the front wheel steering angle to track a predefined fifth-degree polynomial trajectory. Based on a two-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) vehicle dynamics model, the maximum stable vehicle speed during collision avoidance can be determined. If the actual vehicle speed exceeds the maximum stable vehicle speed, braking action will be applied to the vehicle. Furthermore, four-wheel steering (4WS) control and direct yaw moment control (DYC) are employed to further improve the stability of the vehicle during collision avoidance. Simulation results under a double lane change scenario demonstrate that the control system incorporating pre-emptive braking, 4WS, and DYC can enhance the vehicle stability effectively during collision avoidance. Compared to the 2WS system without pre-emptive braking control, the maximum stable vehicle speed of the integrated control system can be increased by at least 56.9%. The proposed integrated control strategy has a positive impact on the safety of autonomous vehicles, and it can also provide reference for the research and development of autonomous driving systems.

AB Electric vehicles (EVs) have been intensively studied in the last decade due to their environment-friendly characteristics. However, the miles-per-charge of EVs is less than that of internal combustion engine vehicles. To improve the miles-per-charge, the authors' group proposed a Range Extension Autonomous Driving (READ) system that minimizes consumption energy by optimizing the velocity profile. However, conventional systems can be applied to driving on only straight roads. Therefore, this study extends READ system to be applied to driving not only on straight roads but also on curved roads by modeling the vehicle rotation motion and the cornering resistance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulations and experiments.

AB In the context of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), this paper aims to examine the impacts of CAVs on mixed regular-automated traffic flow with the increase of the market penetration rate, in consideration of on-ramp merging and off-ramp diverging of vehicles. Lane changes are a major part of lateral motions, affecting surrounding vehicles locally and traffic flow collectively. On the basis of reinforcement learning technique, a cooperative lane-changing strategy was first developed to enable farsighted lane-changing behavior by CAVs in favor of traffic efficiency. The 3-lane highway stretch with one on-ramp and one off-ramp was applied in this study. With extensive simulations, the results suggest that the inclusion of CAVs considerably improves traffic flow, mean speed, and traffic capacity. Meanwhile, the existence of on/off-ramps has substantial impacts on the lane-changing processes. This work can shed some light on an aspect of the mixed traffic network dynamics for future mobility.
