TI Unmanned Surface Vessel Visual Object Detection Under All-Weather
   Conditions with Optimized Feature Fusion Network in YOLOv4

   Across space and scales
AB Object detection based on visual images provides significant technical support to realize autonomous environment perception of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), yet difficulties exist for object detection on the sea surface, such as the constantly-changing weather conditions, considerable changes in the scale of objects, and severe object shaking. In this paper, an USV object detection algorithm is proposed based on an optimized feature fusion network. YOLOv4 was selected as the baseline, which is currently one of the object detection models with the best trade-offs between speed and accuracy. In the proposed weighted Cross Stage Partial Path Aggregation Network (wCSPPAN) structure, the concept of the Cross Stage Partial Network (CSPNet) was applied to the feature fusion network, so as to significantly reduce the amount of computation. In addition, weights that can be learned were introduced to learn input features of different resolutions in a more reasonable way. Finally, to obtain cross-space and cross-scale feature interactions, attempts were made to integrate the universal visual component of the Feature Pyramid Transformer (FPT) with the transformer mechanism in the YOLOv4 model. The FPT was used to transform the feature pyramid into another feature pyramid of the same size with richer contextual information for each level of feature map. We compare the performance with other advanced object detection algorithms. The experiments conducted on the dataset of sea surface buoys, which was collected and produced independently for the present study, and the open source Singapore Maritime Dataset verify that the proposed method achieved good results in the detection of sea objects of different scales under various weather conditions. In particular, the detection of long-distance small objects under foggy conditions with low visibility and extreme conditions was improved, and real-time sea surface object detection was achieved with an inference speed of up to 36FPS on a single RTX 2080Ti. Further, the detection results on the COCO dataset and KITTI dataset verify the excellent generalization ability of our proposed object detection model.

AB Monitoring the structure of forest stands is of high importance for forest managers to help them in maintaining ecosystem services. For that purpose, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) open new prospects, especially in combination with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology. Indeed, the shorter distance from the Earth's surface significantly increases the point density beneath the canopy, thus offering new possibilities for the extraction of the underlying semantics. For example, tree stems can now be captured with sufficient detail, which is a gateway to accurately locating trees and directly retrieving metrics-e.g., the Diameter at Breast Height (DBH). Current practices usually require numerous site-specific parameters, which may preclude their use when applied beyond their initial application context. To overcome this shortcoming, the machine learning Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Application of Noise (HDBSCAN) clustering algorithm was further improved and implemented to segment tree stems. Afterwards, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to extract tree stem orientation for subsequent DBH estimation. This workflow was then validated using LiDAR point clouds collected in a temperate deciduous closed-canopy forest stand during the leaf-on and leaf-off seasons, along with multiple scanning angle ranges. The results show that the proposed methodology can correctly detect up to 82% of tree stems (with a precision of 98%) during the leaf-off season and have a Maximum Scanning Angle Range (MSAR) of 75 degrees, without having to set up any site-specific parameters for the segmentation procedure. In the future, our method could then minimize the omission and commission errors when initially detecting trees, along with assisting further tree metrics retrieval. Finally, this research shows that, under the study conditions, the point density within an approximately 1.3-meter height above the ground remains low within closed-canopy forest stands even during the leaf-off season, thus restricting the accurate estimation of the DBH. As a result, autonomous UAVs that can both fly above and under the canopy provide a clear opportunity to achieve this purpose.

AB A new hydrothermal vent site in the Southern Mariana Trough has been discovered using acoustic and magnetic surveys conducted by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology's (JAMSTEC) autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), Urashima. The high-resolution magnetic survey, part of a near-bottom geophysical mapping around a previously known hydrothermal vent site, the Pika site, during the YK09-08 cruise in June-July 2009, found that a clear magnetization low extends similar to 500 m north from the Pika site. Acoustic signals, suggesting hydrothermal plumes, and 10 m-scale chimney-like topographic highs were detected within this low magnetization zone by a 120 kHz side-scan sonar and a 400 kHz multibeam echo sounder. In order to confirm the seafloor sources of the geophysical signals, seafloor observations were carried out using the deep-sea manned submersible Shinkai 6500 during the YK 10-10 cruise in August 2010. This discovered a new hydrothermal vent site (12 degrees 55.30'N, 143 degrees 38.89'E; at a depth of 2922 m), which we have named the Urashima site. This hydrothermal vent site covers an area of approximately 300 m x 300 m and consists of black and clear smoker chimneys, brownish-colored shimmering chimneys, and inactive chimneys. All of the fluids sampled from the Urashima and Pika sites have chlorinity greater than local ambient seawater, suggesting subseafloor phase separation or leaching from rocks in the hydrothermal reaction zone. End-member compositions of the Urashima and Pika fluids suggest that fluids from two different sources feed the two sites, even though they are located on the same knoll and separated by only similar to 500 m. We demonstrate that investigations on hydrothermal vent sites located in close proximity to one another can provide important insights into subseafloor hydrothermal fluid flow, and also that, while such hydrothermal sites are difficult to detect by conventional plume survey methods, high-resolution underwater geophysical surveys provide an effective means.

TI Mobicast Routing Protocol for Underwater Sensor Networks
SO IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE Geocast; mobicast; multicast; routing; underwater sensor network
AB In this paper, we investigate a mobicast, also called a mobile geocast, problem in three-dimensional (3-D) underwater sensor networks (USNs), which aims to overcome the hole problem and minimizes the energy consumption of the sensor nodes while maximizing the data collection. In this paper, all underwater sensor nodes are randomly distributed in a 3-D underwater environment in the sea to form a 3-D USN. Considered a mobile sink or an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), all possible sensor nodes near the AUV form a 3-D geographic zone called a 3-D zone of reference (3-D ZOR). The AUV travels a user-defined route and continuously collects data from sensor nodes within a series of 3-D ZORs at different times. The main problem is how to efficiently collect data from sensor nodes within a 3-D ZOR while those sensor nodes are usually in sleep mode for a long period. The routing protocol relies on two phases: the first phase consists of collecting data within a 3-D ZOR, and the second phase consists of waking up those sensor nodes in the next 3-D ZOR to be queried while trying to avoid topology holes. To save power, only sensor nodes in a 3-D ZOR are notified to enter the active mode in order to deliver sensed results to the AUV. The specific characteristics of USNs, including low communication bandwidth, large propagation delay, and ocean current, are significantly different from wireless sensor networks. To consider the characteristics of USNs, a new mobicast routing protocol is developed in 3-D USNs. The key design challenge is to develop a power-saving mobicast protocol in 3-D USNs to overcome the unpredictable 3-D hole problem. To solve the hole problem, an "apple slice" technique is used to build multiple segments to surround the hole and to assure routing path continuity. Finally, performance analysis is derived, and simulation results illustrate the performance improvement in successful delivery rate, power consumption, and message overhead.

AB Measuring the reliance of adult spawning winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus Walbaum) on estuarine habitat is problematic and may require acoustic telemetry. Efforts in various estuaries over several years have been hampered by sporadic results in detection of telemetered fish, possibly due to burial. After confirming that captive winter flounder in ambient temperature flow-through enclosures buried often and sometimes deeply, especially during low temperatures, we analyzed the effect of burial on tag signal (76.8 kHz, 5 s repeat rate) during periodic visitation of a grid of listening stations, vessel-towed and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) searches, and continuous 3-D tracking through a synchronized multiple-hydrophone positioning array. Controlled tests of tag burial in situ resulted in complete signal loss with burial at all of the tested depths. The difference between tag detection and decoding was demonstrated to be very important. Water column depth during mobile telemetry positively affected reception of tags lying on the sediment surface. Signal strength of tags on fish at liberty as recorded by an AUV-mounted hydrophone was similar during daytime and subsequent nighttime transects, as were mean counts of decoded signals per tag. However, variance was highly skewed with some tags being heard much more often at night, an expected consequence of nighttime emergence from burial, despite windier (noisier conditions) at night. Meter-scale tracking by multi-hydrophone trilateration over periods of days to weeks determined burial by timeline disruption for individual fish. The use of Markov Models, reference tags, and environmental conditions presents an opportunity to correct for biases in tag detection rates due to burial post facto. In addition, telemetry should consider nighttime efforts during the spawning season and continuous mobile (e.g. towed transect) or more frequent listening stations in search grids and closer moored hydrophone spacing than suggested by reference tags. These approaches may be relevant to other flatfishes and other fishes that bury or use benthic shelters. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is well known that the presence of nonlinearities may significantly affect the aeroelastic response of an aerospace vehicle structure. In this paper, the aeroelastic behaviour at high Mach numbers of an all-moving control surface with a nonlinearity in the root support is investigated. Very often, under certain flight conditions, a stable equilibrium point, corresponding to zero displacement of the structure, together with an unstable limit cycle arising from a sub-critical Hopf bifurcation results from the presence of the nonlinearity. The dynamic aeroelastic response to external excitation is also of interest, and when sinusoidal forcing is applied, the stable equilibrium point may then be replaced by a periodic attractor, and the limit cycle by an unstable multi-periodic solution. With or without this forcing, there is an attractor which will possess a domain of attraction. In this paper, the problem of estimating these domains of attraction is tackled using Zubov's method. In the absence of forcing, the method is applied directly to the aeroelastic equations, while for the forced system, the method of averaging is applied to approximate the aeroelastic equations by an autonomous system. The behaviour of the system with forcing is also investigated for flight speeds below a threshold which may occur where the unstable limit cycle of the unforced system disappears. In this regime, the nonlinear system may nevertheless still possess multiple attractors, and their domains of attraction are investigated, again using an averaged form of the aeroelastic equations. In this study, the nonlinearity in the root support was assumed to be due to a cubic hardening restoring moment. The Zubov approach, which always yields conservative estimates, was shown to be capable of rapidly giving a good indication of stability domain boundaries under many conditions. Although this investigation focuses on an aeroelastic system, the general form of equations considered arises in many other settings, so that the approach would be relevant to a whole range of engineering applications.

AB The ocean is an important sink for carbon and heat, yet high-resolution measurements of biogeochemical properties relevant to global climate change are being made only sporadically in the ocean at present. There is a growing need for automated, real-time, long-term measurements of CO2 in the ocean using a network of sensors, strategically placed oh ships, moorings, free-drifting buoys and autonomous remotely operated vehicles. The ground-truthing of new sensor technologies is a vital component of present and future efforts to monitor changes in the ocean carbon cycle and air-sea exchange of CO2.
   A comparison of a moored Carbon Interface Ocean Atmosphere (CARIOCA) buoy and shipboard fugacity of CO2 (fCO(2)) measurements was conducted in the western North Atlantic during two extended periods (> I month) in 1997. The CARIOCA buoy was deployed on the Bermuda Testbed Mooring (BTM), which is located 5 km noah of the site of the US Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS). The high frequency of sampling revealed that temperature and fCO(2) responded to physical forcing by the atmosphere on timescales from diurnal to 4-8 days. Concurrent with the deployments of the CARIOCA buoy, frequent measurements of surface fCO(2) were made from the R/V Weatherbird II during opportunistic visits to the BTM and BATS sites, providing a direct calibration of the CARIOCA buoy fCO(2) data. Although, the in situ ground-truthing of the CARIOCA buoy was complicated by diurnal processes, sub-mesoscale and fine-scale variability, the CARIOCA buoy fCO(2) data was accurate within 3+/-6 mu atm of shipboard fCO(2) data for periods up to 50 days. Longer-term assessments were not possible due to the CARIOCA buoy breaking free of the BTM and drifting into waters with different fCO(2)-temperature properties. Strategies are put forward for future calibration of other in situ sensors. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Visual inspections of aircraft exterior surfaces are required in aircraft maintenance routines for identifying possible defects such as dents, cracks, leaking, broken or missing parts, etc. This process is time-consuming and is also prone to error if performed manually. Therefore, it has become a trend to use mobile robots equipped with visual sensors to perform automated inspections. For such a robotic inspection, a digital model of the aircraft is usually required for planning the robot's path, but a CAD model of the entire aircraft is usually inaccessible to most maintenance shops. It is very labor-intensive and time-consuming to generate an accurate digital model of an aircraft, or even a large portion of it, because the scanning work still must be performed manually or by a manually controlled robotic system. This paper presents a two-stage approach of automating aircraft scanning with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or autonomous drone equipped with a red-green-blue and depth (RGB-D) camera for detailed inspection or for reconstructing a digital replica of the aircraft when its original CAD model is unavailable. In the first stage, the UAV-camera system follows a predefined path far from the aircraft surface (for safety) to quickly scan the aircraft and generate a coarse model of the aircraft. Then, an optimal scanning path (much closer to the surface) in the sense of the shortest flying distance for full coverage is computed based on the coarse model. In the second stage, the UAV-camera system follows the computed path to closely inspect the surface for possible defects or scan the surface for generating a dense and precise model of the aircraft. We solved the coverage path planning (CPP) problem for the aircraft inspection or scanning using a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm. We also implemented the max-min ant system (MMAS) strategy to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We carried out a digital experiment and the results showed that our approach can scan 70% of the aircraft surface within one hour, which is much more efficient than manual scanning.

AB The integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), in which the sensing and communication share the same frequency band and hardware, has emerged as a key technology in future wireless systems due to two main reasons. First, many important application scenarios in fifth generation (5G) and beyond, such as autonomous vehicles, Wi-Fi sensing and extended reality, requires both high-performance sensing and wireless communications. Second, with millimeter wave and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technologies widely employed in 5G and beyond, the future communication signals tend to have high-resolution in both time and angular domain, opening up the possibility for ISAC. As such, ISAC has attracted tremendous research interest and attentions in both academia and industry. Early works on ISAC have been focused on the design, analysis and optimization of practical ISAC technologies for various ISAC systems. While this line of works are necessary, it is equally important to study the fundamental limits of ISAC in order to understand the gap between the current state-of-the-art technologies and the performance limits, and provide useful insights and guidance for the development of better ISAC technologies that can approach the performance limits. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive survey for the current research progress on the fundamental limits of ISAC. Particularly, we first propose a systematic classification method for both traditional radio sensing (such as radar sensing and wireless localization) and ISAC so that they can be naturally incorporated into a unified framework. Then we summarize the major performance metrics and bounds used in sensing, communications and ISAC, respectively. After that, we present the current research progresses on fundamental limits of each class of the traditional sensing and ISAC systems. Finally, the open problems and future research directions are discussed.

TI A BIM-based method to plan indoor paths

AB Humans more and more live in urban areas and spend the majority of their time indoors, while buildings are becoming increasingly interconnected. Path planning in complex indoor environments is consequently becoming a societal challenge. This paper proposes a system, called BiMov, dedicated to automatically determining plan paths in complex buildings based on a digital mock-up (a BIM in IFC format). The originality of the research comes from the separation of the BIM model topological analysis from the semantic and geometric consideration of the customer of the path planning service. The process consists in exploiting the semantic, geometric, and topological features of the constituents of a BIM to generate navigation graphs that take the profile of MOoP (Mobile Object or Person) and the operational accessibility status of spaces and transitions (such as doors or stairs) into account. The ultimate aim is to determine the optimal path according to given criteria. The system is based on four data models: (1) a building model derived from the original BIM that represents and structures the building features relevant to indoor mobility; (2) a MOoP model representing its bulk size, ability to move horizontally and vertically, and various authorisations; (3) a calendar model representing the conjectural accessibility status of spaces and transitions; (4) a navigation graph model proposing three levels of detail. The Macro level represents a simple graph of connectivity between neighbouring interior spaces and is intended to help architects verify their design in terms of accessibility. The External level is used to connect accessible spaces via their common horizontal or vertical transitions. This level is intended for MOoPs that do not require a detailed description of the path. The Internal level integrates meshing of each space: a 2D mesh for planar mobility or a 3D mesh for drones. This level is intended for MOoP such as heavy object handlers or autonomous mobile vehicles that need to validate a reliable path within spaces containing furniture, hazardous machinery, or bulky equipment. We developed a prototype software application that illustrates our approach for different path planning scenarios in a BIM model generated outside this project.

AB Using depth estimation joint target detection networks to locate targets in the UAV field of view is a novel application in the depth estimation research field. The presence of more depth variations and low-texture regions in the ultra-low altitude oblique photographic images make them trickier to train for an excellent depth estimation network compared to autonomous driving scenarios. This presents a challenge in achieving optimal training. This study investigates the problem of unsupervised monocular depth estimation for ultra-low altitude oblique photography images. It aims to make subsequent advanced vision tasks better benefit from excellent depth estimation results in terms of overcoming complex scenes. The lack of effective back-projection directionality in training using adjacent frames is attributed to the extensive low-textured areas contained in the training data for complex ultra-low altitude oblique photography. We propose a self-supervised scene-aware refinement learning architecture from the perspective of enhancing feature perception to deal with such problems. The architecture consists of a multi-resolution feature fusion depth network and a perceptual refinement network (PRNet), together with a pose network to enhance regional differences in complex environments from a refined feature context perspective to obtain higher quality depth maps. We rethink the problem of depth information recovery and design the edge information aggregation (EIA) module, which is configured in the decoder section to refine the local region depth detail representation. We design several loss terms to constrain the training of the network in order to improve the quality of depth estimation. Our method is compared with six state-of-the-art self-supervised monocular depth estimation methods on three datasets (UAVid 2020, WildUAV, UAV ula). The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves the best performance in most scenarios. The code and the private dataset (UAV ula) can be publicly available at https://github.com/takisu0916/MRFEDepth.

AB The recent booming of artificial intelligence (AI) applications, e.g., affective robots, human-machine interfaces, autonomous vehicles, and so on, has produced a great number of multi-modal records of human communication. Such data often carry latent subjective users' attitudes and opinions, which provides a practical and feasible path to realize the connection between human emotion and intelligence services. Sentiment and emotion analysis of multi-modal records is of great value to improve the intelligence level of affective services. However, how to find an optimal manner to learn people's sentiments and emotional representations has been a difficult problem, since both of them involve subtle mind activity. To solve this problem, a lot of approaches have been published, but most of them are insufficient to mine sentiment and emotion, since they have treated sentiment analysis and emotion recognition as two separate tasks. The interaction between them has been neglected, which limits the efficiency of sentiment and emotion representation learning. In this work, emotion is seen as the external expression of sentiment, while sentiment is the essential nature of emotion. We thus argue that they are strongly related to each other where one's judgment helps the decision of the other. The key challenges are multi-modal fused representation and the interaction between sentiment and emotion. To solve such issues, we design an external knowledge enhanced multi-task representation learning network, termed KAMT. The major elements contain two attention mechanisms, which are inter-modal and inter-task attentions and an external knowledge augmentation layer. The external knowledge augmentation layer is used to extract the vector of the participant's gender, age, occupation, and of overall color or shape. The main use of inter-modal attention is to capture effective multi-modal fused features. Inter-task attention is designed to model the correlation between sentiment analysis and emotion classification. We perform experiments on three widely used datasets, and the experimental performance proves the effectiveness of the KAMT model.

AB There have been increasing demands for developing microaerial vehicles with vision-based autonomy for search and rescue missions in complex environments. In particular, the monocular visual-inertial system (VINS), which consists of only an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a camera, forms a great lightweight sensor suite due to its low weight and small footprint. In this paper, we address two challenges for rapid deployment of monocular VINS: 1) the initialization problem and 2) the calibration problem. We propose a methodology that is able to initialize velocity, gravity, visual scale, and camera-IMU extrinsic calibration on the fly. Our approach operates in natural environments and does not use any artificial markers. It also does not require any prior knowledge about the mechanical configuration of the system. It is a significant step toward plug- and-play and highly customizable visual navigation for mobile robots. We show through online experiments that our method leads to accurate calibration of camera-IMU transformation, with errors less than 0.02 m in translation and 1 degrees in rotation. We compare out method with a state-of-the-art marker-based offline calibration method and show superior results. We also demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach in large-scale indoor and outdoor experiments.
   Note to Practitioners-This paper presents a methodology for online state estimation in natural environments using only a camera and a low-cost micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) IMU. It focuses on addressing the problems of online estimator initialization, sensor extrinsic calibration, and nonlinear optimization with online refinement of calibration parameters. This paper is particularly useful for applications that have superior size, weight, and power constraints. It aims for rapid deployment of robot platforms with robust state estimation capabilities with almost no setup, calibration, or initialization overhead. The proposed method can be used in platforms including handheld devices, aerial robots, and other small-scale mobile platforms, with applications in monitoring, inspection, and search and rescue.

AB Distributions of oxygen in surface sediments from central Sagami Bay were quantified using an autonomous vehicle carrying both a profiling microelectrode instrument and a planar optode module. Measurements were performed at 16 sites (either by microelectrodes or optodes) along a similar to 175m long transect and in total 45 electrode microprofiles and 6 O-2 images (each covering 6.9 x 5.1 cm of surface sediment) were obtained. The data revealed an extensive small-scale variation of the in situ O-2 distribution. The diffusive O-2 uptake (DOU) as derived from the microelectrode data varied by a factor > 10 with an average value of 2.6 +/- 1.6 mmol m(-2) d(-1) (n = 45) corresponding to similar to 8% of the estimated average primary production for the area.
   There was no significant difference in the average O-2 penetration depth as quantified from the microprofiles and the planar optode images (P < 0.05). The O-2 penetration depth of the combined dataset varied between 0.5 and 9.2 mm with an average value of 3.9 +/- 1.5 mm (n = 347). Even though the organic carbon rich sediments of central Sagami Bay may exhibit higher horizontal heterogeneity than normally encountered in deep-sea sediments, the data document that extrapolation from a few in situ data points should be done with caution. A detailed statistical analysis of the spatial autocorrelation in the O-2 penetration depth documented that measurements performed less than 2 cm apart were autocorrelated. This implies that the aerobic benthic activity at the investigated site varied in patches with a characteristic size of a few cm. The presented data represent a detailed in situ study on small-scale spatial variability in sediment O-2 distribution and document that planar O-2 optode images provide a tool to access spatial heterogeneity of natural sediments.

TI Semi-tightly coupled integration of multi-GNSS PPP and S-VINS for

AB Because of its high-precision, low-cost and easy-operation, Precise Point Positioning (PPP) becomes a potential and attractive positioning technique that can be applied to self-driving cars and drones. However, the reliability and availability of PPP will be significantly degraded in the extremely difficult conditions where Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are blocked frequently. Inertial Navigation System (INS) has been integrated with GNSS to ameliorate such situations in the last decades. Recently, the Visual-Inertial Navigation Systems (VINS) with favorable complementary characteristics is demonstrated to realize a more stable and accurate local position estimation than the INS-only. Nevertheless, the system still must rely on the global positions to eliminate the accumulated errors. In this contribution, we present a semi-tight coupling framework of multi-GNSS PPP and Stereo VINS (S-VINS), which achieves the bidirectional location transfer and sharing in two separate navigation systems. In our approach, the local positions, produced by S-VINS are integrated with multi-GNSS PPP through a graph-optimization based method. Furthermore, the accurate forecast positions with S-VINS are fed back to assist PPP in GNSS-challenged environments. The statistical analysis of a GNSS outage simulation test shows that the S-VINS mode can effectively suppress the degradation of positioning accuracy compared with the INS-only mode. We also carried out a vehicle-borne experiment collecting multi-sensor data in a GNSS-challenged environment. For the complex driving environment, the PPP positioning capability is significantly improved with the aiding of S-VINS. The 3D positioning accuracy is improved by 49.0% for Global Positioning System (GPS), 40.3% for GPS + GLOANSS (Global Navigation Satellite System), 45.6% for GPS + BDS (BeiDou navigation satellite System), and 51.2% for GPS + GLONASS + BDS. On this basis, the solution with the semi-tight coupling scheme of multi-GNSS PPP/S-VINS achieves the improvements of 41.8-60.6% in 3D positioning accuracy compared with the multi-GNSS PPP/INS solutions.

AB Batteries are the crucial link in accelerating the penetration of renewables in distributed grid systems. With multiple sources (most of which are intermittent), there is a need to optimize the usage of these energy storage systems. It is vital to have a charging algorithm to intelligently charge the battery, considering the losses and state of health. Several battery charging techniques exist for most of the mainstream batteries such as lithium ion and lead acid batteries. These charging algorithms are developed for specific battery chemistries to optimize the charging operation by controlling the charging current. There has been no specific charging methodology proposed, considering the uniqueness of flow batteries. In this paper a flow battery model is developed to accommodate the implementation of charging protocols by controlling the current and flow rate in real time. The aim is to demonstrate a methodology where different user requirements can be programmed for efficient operation of the battery to perform a given task. The control is established by an intuitive fuzzy logic controller for changing the input variables based on the intrinsic losses, pump power loss and the capacity decay due to the aging of the battery. The need for such a controller to handle different scenarios of operation arises from the vast applicability of large scale energy storage. A simple example of such a system is proposed with demonstrating three operator selectable modes namely Autonomous (A), Energy bias (E) and Time bias (T). In each case, a specific current value and flow rate value is selected by the controller and is finetuned during the charging process. The values are tuned for specific modes of operation and different aspects of the battery performance are studied for these modes. This work demonstrates a method to leverage the use of a physical model based system in a high level user interface for controlling flow batteries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Protein and Calorie Restriction Contribute Additively to Protection from

AB Background: Short-term dietary restriction (DR) without malnutrition preconditions against surgical stress in rodents; however, the nutritional basis and underlying nutrient/energy-sensing pathways remain poorly understood.
   Objectives: We investigated the relative contribution of protein restriction (PR) vs. calorie restriction (CR) to protection from renal ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) and changes in organ-autonomous nutrient/energy-sensing pathways and hormones underlying beneficial effects.
   Methods: Mice were preconditioned on experimental diets lacking total calories (0-50% CR) or protein/essential amino acids (EAAs) vs. complete diets consumed ad libitum (AL) for 1 wk before IRI. Renal outcome was assessed by serum markers and histology and integrated over a 2-dimensional protein/energy landscape by geometric framework analysis. Changes in renal nutrient/energy-sensing signal transduction and systemic hormones leptin and adiponectin were also measured. The genetic requirement for amino acid sensing via general control non-derepressible 2 (GCN2) was tested with knockout vs. control mice. The involvement of the hormone leptin was tested by injection of recombinant protein vs. vehicle during the preconditioning period.
   Results: CR-mediated protection was dose dependent up to 50% with maximal 2-fold effect sizes. PR benefits were abrogated by EAA re-addition and additive with CR, with maximal benefits at any given amount of CR occurring with a protein-free diet. GCN2 was not required for functional benefits of PR. Activation and repression of nutrient/energy-sensing kinases, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), respectively, on PR reflected a state of negative energy balance, paralleled by 13% weight loss and an 87% decrease in leptin, independent of calorie intake. Recombinant leptin administration partially abrogated benefits of dietary preconditioning against renal IRI.
   Conclusions: In male mice, PR and CR both contributed to the benefits of short-term DR against renal (RI independent of GCN2 but partially dependent on reduced circulating leptin and coincident with AMPK activation and mTORC1 repression.

AB Sounds from toadfish Opsanus sp., and 4 other suspected fish sounds were identified in passive acoustic recordings from fixed recorders and autonomous underwater vehicles in the eastern Gulf of Mexico between 2008 and 2011. Data were collected in depths ranging from 4 to 984 m covering approximately 39000 km(2). The goals of this research were to map the spatial and temporal occurrence of these sounds. Sound production was correlated to environmental para meters (water depth, lunar cycle, and dawn and dusk) to understand the variability in seasonal calling. Toadfish 'boatwhistles' were recorded throughout the diel period, with peaks observed between 15:00 and 04:00 h. Annual peaks coincided with the spawning period in the late spring to early summer. The 4 unknown sounds were termed: '100 Hz Pulsing', '6 kHz Sound', '300 Hz FM Harmonic', and '365 Hz Harmonic'. The 100 Hz Pulsing had the temporal characteristics of a cusk-eel call with frequencies below 500 Hz. Sound production was observed mainly at night with annual peaks in the spring and fall. The 6 kHz Sound was observed exclusively at night between 15 and 50 m bottom depths; occurrence decreased significantly in the winter. The 6 kHz Sound peak frequencies correlated positively to satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) and negatively to chlorophyll concentration. The 300 Hz FM Harmonic was observed largely (89%) at night and appeared offshore (40-200 m depth). The 365 Hz Harmonic was observed 98% of the time at night, inshore (<40 m depth). The fundamental frequency of the 365 Hz Harmonic was positively correlated with SST, reflecting a temperature-driven increase in sonic muscle contraction rate; conversely, call duration was negatively correlated. The ubiquity of these 4 unknown sounds illustrates how little is known about biological communication in the marine environment.

AB A series of large-scale erosional scours are described from four modern deep-water canyon and/or channel systems along the northeast Atlantic continental margin. Regional-scale geophysical data indicate that most scours occur in zones of rapid flow expansion, such as canyon and/or channel termini and margins. High-resolution images of the scours cover similar to 25 km(2) at 2 x 2 m pixel size, and were obtained at depths of 4200-4900 m using Autosub6000, an autonomous underwater vehicle equipped with an EM2000 multibeam bathymetry system. Sedimentological and microfossil-based chronological data of scour fills and interscour areas were obtained via accurately located piston cores that targeted specific sites within imaged areas. These core data reveal a number of key findings. (1) Deep-water scours can be very long lived (> 0.2 m.y.) and may undergo discrete phases of isolation, amalgamation, and infilling. (2) Deep-water scours can develop via a composite of cutting and filling events with periodicities of between tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of years. (3) Immediately adjacent scours may have strikingly different sedimentological histories and do not necessarily evolve contemporaneously. (4) Scour infills are typically out of phase with sedimentation in intrascour areas, having thin sands internally and thick sands externally, or thick muds internally and thin muds externally. (5) Erosional hiatuses within scour fills may represent hundreds of thousands of years of time, and yet leave little visible record. Four distinct morphologies of scour are identified that range from 40 to 3170 m wide and 8 to 48 m deep: spoon shaped, heel shaped, crescent shaped, and oval shaped. Isolated scours are shown to coalesce laterally into broad regions of amalgamated scour that may be several kilometers across. The combined morphosedimentological data set is used to examine some of the putative formative mechanisms for scour genesis.

AB We report results from an investigation of the geologic processes controlling hydrothermal activity along the previously-unstudied southern Mid-Atlantic Ridge (3-7 degrees S). Our study employed the NOC (UK) deep-tow sidescan sonar instrument, TOBI, in concert with the WHOI (USA) autonomous underwater vehicle, ABE, to collect information concerning hydrothermal plume distributions in the water column co-registered with geologic investigations of the underlying seafloor. Two areas of high-temperature hydrothermal venting were identified. The first was situated in a non-transform discontinuity (NTD) between two adjacent second-order ridge-segments near 4 degrees 02'S, distant from any neovolcanic activity. This geologic setting is very similar to that of the ultramafic-hosted and tectonically-controlled Rainbow vent-site on the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The second site was located at 4 degrees 48'S at the axial-summit centre of a second-order ridge-segment. There, high-temperature venting is hosted in an similar to 18 km(2) area of young lava flows which in some cases are observed to have flowed over and engulfed pre-existing chemosynthetic vent-fauna. In both appearance and extent, these lava flows are directly reminiscent of those emplaced in Winter 2005-06 at the East Pacific Rise, 9 degrees 50'N and reference to global seismic catalogues reveals that a swarm of large (M 4.6-5.6) seismic events was centred on the 5 degrees S segment over a similar to 24 h period in late June 2002, perhaps indicating the precise timing of this volcanic eruptive episode. Temperature measurements at one of the vents found directly adjacent to the fresh lava flows at 5 degrees S MAR (Turtle Pits) have subsequently revealed vent-fluids that are actively phase separating under conditions very close to the Critical Point for seawater, at similar to 3000 m depth and 407 degrees C: the hottest vent-fluids yet reported from anywhere along the global ridge crest.

AB Accurate and traceable measurements are required to understand ocean processes, to address pressing societal challenges, such as climate change and to sustainably manage marine resources. Although scientific and engineering research has resulted in advanced methods to measure Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) there is a need for cross comparison of the techniques and traceability to recognized standards. Metrological laboratories are experienced in accredited methods and assessment of methodology. An EU INFRAIA-02-2020: Integrating Activities for Starting Communities project MINKE (Metrology for Integrated marine maNagement and Knowledge-transfer nEtwork https://minke.eu) brings European marine science and metrology Research Infrastructures together to identify synergies and create an innovative approach to Quality Assurance of oceanographic data. Quality depends both on the accuracy (that can be provided through the metrology component) and the completeness of the data sets. The collaboration between different Marine Research Infrastructures (RIs) places a fundamental role on assuring the completeness of the datasets, particularly at global scales. The MINKE project encourages enhancement through collaboration of national metrology laboratories and the oceanographic community. Metrological assessment of the accuracy and uncertainties within multidisciplinary ocean observations will provide data that are key to delivering policy information. Objectives across all the RIs are to facilitate ocean observation and build wider synergies. MINKE will investigate these synergies, then introduce metrology to the core of various EOV measurements. Currently the marine RIs cover laboratory and field operations, from the surface seafloor, coastal waters to deep sea, fixed ocean stations to ship and autonomous vehicle operations to ships of opportunity, and flux stations focusing on carbonate system variables. The nexus of these operations is the focal point for coordinated improvement of ocean observing methods. Measurement intercomparisons, traceability and uncertainty assessments should be at the core of the scientific observations. Specifically, MINKE will work with RIs and Metrology Institutes to improve the quality of dissolved oxygen, carbonate system, chlorophyll-fluorescence, ocean sound and current meter measurements, through access to metrology laboratories, Transnational Access and intercomparison studies across existing marine consortia and RIs. MINKE will also promote the development of absolute salinity observation, and improvements in marine litter measurements.

ID HIGH-RESOLUTION
AB Metabarcoding analysis of environmental DNA samples is a promising new tool for marine biodiversity and conservation. Typically, seawater samples are obtained using Niskin bottles and filtered to collect eDNA. However, standard sample volumes are small relative to the scale of the environment, conventional collection strategies are limited, and the filtration process is time consuming. To overcome these limitations, we developed a new large - volume eDNA sampler with in situ filtration, capable of taking up to 12 samples per deployment. We conducted three deployments of our sampler on the robotic vehicle Mesobot in the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico and collected samples from 20 to 400 m depth. We compared the large volume (similar to 40-60 L) samples collected by Mesobot with small volume (similar to 2 L) samples collected using the conventional CTD rosette - mounted Niskin bottle approach. We sequenced the V9 region of 18S rRNA, which detects a broad range of invertebrate taxa, and found that while both methods detected biodiversity changes associated with depth, our large volume samples detected approximately 66% more taxa than the CTD small volume samples. We found that the fraction of the eDNA signal originating from metazoans relative to the total eDNA signal decreased with sampling depth, indicating that larger volume samples may be especially important for detecting metazoans in mesopelagic and deep ocean environments. We also noted substantial variability in biological replicates from both the large volume Mesobot and small volume CTD sample sets. Both of the sample sets also identified taxa that the other did not - although the number of unique taxa associated with the Mesobot samples was almost four times larger than those from the CTD samples. Large volume eDNA sampling with in situ filtration, particularly when coupled with robotic platforms, has great po-tential for marine biodiversity surveys, and we discuss practical methodological and sampling considerations for future applications.

ID RADIATION-DAMAGE; ASTROMETRY; IMPACT
AB The European Space Agency's Gaia satellite was launched into orbit around L2 in December 2013 with a payload containing 106 large-format scientific CCDs. The primary goal of the mission is to repeatedly obtain high-precision astrometric and photometric measurements of one thousand million stars over the course of five years. The scientific value of the down-linked data, and the operation of the onboard autonomous detection chain, relies on the high performance of the detectors. As Gaia slowly rotates and scans the sky, the CCDs are continuously operated in a mode where the line clock rate and the satellite rotation spin-rate are in synchronisation. Nominal mission operations began in July 2014 and the first data release is being prepared for release at the end of Summer 2016. In this paper we present an overview of the focal plane, the detector system, and strategies for on-orbit performance monitoring of the system. This is followed by a presentation of the performance results based on analysis of data acquired during a two-year window beginning at payload switch-on. Results for parameters such as readout noise and electronic off set behaviour are presented and we pay particular attention to the effects of the L2 radiation environment on the devices. The radiation-induced degradation in the charge transfer efficiency (CTE) in the (parallel) scan direction is clearly diagnosed; however, an extrapolation shows that charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) effects at end of mission will be approximately an order of magnitude less than predicted pre-flight. It is shown that the CTI in the serial register (horizontal direction) is still dominated by the traps inherent to the manufacturing process and that the radiation-induced degradation so far is only a few per cent. We also present results on the tracking of ionising radiation damage and hot pixel evolution. Finally, we summarise some of the detector effects discovered on-orbit which are still being investigated.

TI Levy Foraging in a Dynamic Environment - Extending the Levy Search

ID FLIGHTS; MODELS
AB A common task for robots is the patrolling of an unknown area with inadequate information about target locations. Under these circumstances it has been suggested that animal foraging could provide an optimal or at least suboptimal search methodology, namely the Levy flight search. Although still in debate, it seems that predators somehow follow this search pattern when foraging, because it avoids being trapped in a local search if the food is beyond the sensory range. A Levy flight is a particular case of the random walk. Its displacements on a 2-D surface are drawn from the Pareto-Levy probability distribution, characterized by power law tails. The Levy flight search has many applications in optical material, ladars, optics, large database search, earthquake data analysis, location of DNA sites, human mobility, stock return analysis, online auctions, astronomy, ecology and biology. Almost all studies and simulations concerning the Levy flight foraging examine static or slowly moving (with respect to the forager) uniformly distributed resources. Moreover, in recent works a small swarm of underwater autonomous vehicles has been used to test the standard Levy search in the underwater environment, with good results. In this paper we extend the classical Levy foraging framework taking into consideration a moving target allocated on a 2-D surface according to a radial probability distribution and comparing its performance with the random walk search. The metric used in the numerical simulations is the detection rate. Simulations include the sensor resolution, intended as the maximum detection distance of the forager from the target. Furthermore, contrarily to the usual Levy foraging framework, we use only one target. Results show that Levy flight outperforms the random walk if the sensor detection radius is not too small or too large. We also find the Levy flight in the velocity of the center of mass model of a fish school according the Kuramoto equation, a famous model of synchronization phenomena. Finally, a discussion about the controversy concerning the innate or evolutionary origin of the Levy foraging is given.

   Fault, Sea of Marmara
SO NEAR SURFACE GEOPHYSICS

DT Article

AB High Resolution (HR) marine seismic acquisition contributes to numerous research fields. The vertical resolution is of metric scale in order to study geological processes at a short time scale or to characterise small objects. 3D seismic imaging allows optimal resolution to be reached whereas 2D images are blurred mainly by side effects. Developed for the oil industry decades ago and tailored to the exploration for hydrocarbon reservoirs, 3D seismic, as applied to higher resolution targets, is more recent. Available technological advances in acquisition have allowed research institutes to develop innovative 3D high-resolution marine seismic systems tailored to these targets.
   The seismic survey carried out in 2009 on the Western High, Sea of Marmara, illustrates the value of HR3D imaging. Since the destructive Izmit earthquake in 1999, an intensive international research effort has demonstrated that the Western High is one of the key structures for assessing the processes of deformation related to the North Anatolian Fault (NAF). The 30-km(2) HR3D survey centred on the main NAF was acquired using a dual streamers - dual source-array configuration. In spite of the minimal 3D processing sequence that was applied to the data, the fine imaging of the seabed and of the sedimentary stratigraphy and structures is much better than HR2D seismic. Comparison with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) multi-beam bathymetric survey carried out at the same location enables the limits of the vertical resolution of the seismic data to be assessed. The lateral resolution is between 13.5 and 25 metres at the seabed. The HR3D seismic data highlight the interplay between tectonic processes and stratigraphy. In particular, differential uplift leads to syntectonic deposition and submarine slides. The widespread occurrence of gas in the sedimentary sequence is clearly shown by anomalously high seismic amplitudes. 3D imaging of these high amplitudes enables the identification of the pathways through faults and permeable units that gas takes as it migrates to the seabed.

AB Chemoattractants expressed at bony sites and pelvic lymph nodes are thought to promote the preferential metastasis of human prostate tumor cells to these organs. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a potent chemoattractant for several human metastatic prostate tumor cell Lines, including the TSU-pr1 cell line, and EGF has been localized to the stroma of both bony sites and pelvic lymph nodes in humans. Hence, we investigated whether the TSU-pr1 cell line expresses a functional EGF receptor (EGFR), which when antagonized reduces EGF-mediated chemomigration of this cell line. In this context, the EGFR immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of TSU-pr1 cells comigrated with the EGFR from A431 cells at a molecular weight of 170 kD. Addition of human EGF (hEGF) to the TSU-pr1 cells for 5 min stimulated the dose-dependent biphasic phosphorylation of the EGFR, with maximal stimulation of EGFR phosphorylation occurring at 2 ng/ml hEGF. In addition, treatment of hEGF-stimulated (2 ng/ml) TSU-pr1 cells with 0.5 mu g/ml anti-hEGFR monoclonal antibody or 100 nM staurosporine inhibited EGFR phosphorylation. Conversely, as negative controls, treatment of hEGF-stimulated (2 ng/ml) TSU-pr1 cells with K252a or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle did not inhibit EGFR phosphorylation. TSU-pr1 cells were stimulated to migration in 4 hr across Boyden chambers in response to 10 ng/ml hEGF. Treatment of the TSU-pr1 cells with anti-hEGFR monoclonal antibody inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the chemomigration of the TSU-pr1 cells across Boyden chambers. Similarly, treatment of the TSU-pr1 cells with staurosporine inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the chemomigration of the TSU-pr1 cells across Boyden chambers. These results demonstrate that antagonists of hEGF-mediated hEGFR phosyhorylation also antagonize chemomigration of the TSU-pr1 cells across Boyden chambers, suggesting that antagonists of the EGFR in prostate cancer may be useful in the treatment of metastatic disease.

AB The increase in greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector together with the continued depletion of fossil fuels in general has encouraged an increase in the use of energy storage systems and renewable energy sources at seaports and also on short route yachts and ferries. At present, most seaports, particularly smaller ones, are not provided with cold-ironing facilities-shore-based power facilities, which provide electric power to ships from the national grid. Because of the lack of cold-ironing facilities at most ports, auxiliary diesel engines and diesel generators on ships must be kept operating and online while at berth to supply auxiliary loads of ship. To address these requirements, one possible solution would be to provide cold-ironing facilities at all ports. However, in many circumstances, this is not cost-efficient as a port might be far from the national grid. To overcome these limitations, a seaport microgrid can be formed through the integration of multiple shipboard microgrids (SMGs) with decentralized control together with a charging infrastructure that is located on-shore. This integration of multiple SMGs and port-based charging stations is termed a ship-based seaport microgrid. Typically, power is shared among different microgrids using data communication techniques, which adds to the cost and the complexity of the overall system. This article proposes a communication-less approach based on multimode, decentralized droop control that enables power sharing among several SMGs in both charging and discharging modes based on the state of charge of battery banks-electric power is either supplied or consumed. The proposed approach would be potentially useful for future autonomous ships and also for islands where port electrification is either not technically feasible or an economically viable solution. A simulation and hardware-in-the-loop results are provided to verify the control robustness of the proposed control strategy.

AB The oceanic crust is initially cooled and deep-sea chemosynthetic ecosystems are largely fed by hydrothermal circulation and venting on the seafloor. Much of this venting takes place at mid-ocean ridges and in order to make realistic models of the crusts thermal budget and to understand chemosynthetic biogeography it is important to have a detailed inventory of vent sites. Until recently, a major gap in this inventory was the Mid-Atlantic Ridge south of 13 degrees S, a key region for vent fauna biogeography as it is the corridor linking the Atlantic to the Indian and Pacific Oceans. In spring 2013 we systematically surveyed the axial region between 13 degrees S and 33 degrees S for hydrothermal signals in the water column, using turbidity, oxidation-reduction-potential (ORP) and noble gases as indicators. Standard conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) rosette water-sampler deployments were complimented by a novel autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) deployment strategy, in which the AUV made single-pass, segment-scale (up to 100 km long) dives close to the seafloor to detect small vents. The ca. 2100 km-long survey covered 16 ridge segments and we identified previously unknown hydrothermal plumes above ten segments that point to 14 new hydrothermal vent fields. The majority of plumes are located at high-relief segment centers, where magmatism is robust. A wide gap in the distribution of vents in the 19 degrees S-23 degrees S region coincides with the Rio de Janeiro Transform, the maximum southward progression of North Atlantic Deep Waters and the maximum northwards extent of He-3-enriched waters with Pacific origins. Crossflowing currents in the transform and the large gap between adjacent vents may prevent a meridional connection between the vent fauna communities in the North Atlantic and along the Antarctic Ridges. This makes the region a prime target for future biogeographical studies.

AB Autonomous vehicles are soon to become ubiquitous in large urban areas, encompassing cities, suburbs and vast highway networks. In turn, this will bring new challenges to the existing traffic management expert systems. Concurrently, urban development is causing growth, thus changing the network structures. As such, a new generation of adaptive algorithms are needed, ones that learn in real-time, capture the multivariate nonlinear spatio-temporal dependencies and are easily adaptable to new data (e.g. weather or crowdsourced data) and changes in network structure, without having to retrain and/or redeploy the entire system.
   We propose learning Topology-Regularized Universal Vector Autoregression (TRU-VAR) and examplify deployment with of state-of-the-art function approximators. Our expert system produces reliable forecasts in large urban areas and is best described as scalable, versatile and accurate. By introducing constraints via a topology-designed adjacency matrix (TDAM), we simultaneously reduce computational complexity while improving accuracy by capturing the non-linear spatio-temporal dependencies between timeseries. The strength of our method also resides in its redundancy through modularity and adaptability via the TDAM, which can be altered even while the system is deployed. The large-scale network-wide empirical evaluations on two qualitatively and quantitatively different datasets show that our method scales well and can be trained efficiently with low generalization error.
   We also provide a broad review of the literature and illustrate the complex dependencies at intersections and discuss the issues of data broadcasted by road network sensors. The lowest prediction error was observed for TRU-VAR, which outperforms ARIMA in all cases and the equivalent univariate predictors in almost all cases for both datasets. We conclude that forecasting accuracy is heavily influenced by the TDAM, which should be tailored specifically for each dataset and network type. Further improvements are possible based on including additional data in the model, such as readings from different metrics. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Energy-Efficient Relay-Based Void Hole Prevention and Repair in
   Clustered Multi-AUV Underwater Wireless Sensor Network
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS

DT Article
ID ROUTING PROTOCOLS; INTERNET; SCHEME
AB Underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) enable various oceanic applications which require effective packet transmission. In this case, sparse node distribution, imbalance in terms of overall energy consumption between the different sensor nodes, dynamic network topology, and inappropriate selection of relay nodes cause void holes. Addressing this problem, we present a relay-based void hole prevention and repair (ReVOHPR) protocol by multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for UWSN. ReVOHPR is a global solution that implements different phases of operations that act mutually in order to efficiently reduce and identify void holes and trap relay nodes to avoid it. ReVOHPR adopts the following operations as ocean depth (levels)-based equal cluster formation, dynamic sleep scheduling, virtual graph-based routing, and relay-assisted void hole repair. For energy-efficient cluster forming, entropy-based eligibility ranking (E2R) is presented, which elects stable cluster heads (CHs). Then, dynamic sleep scheduling is implemented by the dynamic kernel Kalman filter (DK2F) algorithm in which sleep and active modes are based on the node's current status. Intercluster routing is performed by maximum matching nodes that are selected by dual criteria, and also the data are transmitted to AUV. Finally, void holes are detected and repaired by the bicriteria mayfly optimization (BiCMO) algorithm. The BiCMO focuses on reducing the number of holes and data packet loss and maximizes the quality of service (QoS) and energy efficiency of the network. This protocol is timely dealing with node failures in packet transmission via multihop routing. Simulation is implemented by the NS3 (AquaSim module) simulator that evaluates the performance in the network according to the following metrics: average energy consumption, delay, packet delivery rate, and throughput. The simulation results of the proposed REVOHPR protocol comparing to the previous protocols allowed to conclude that the REVOHPR has considerable advantages. Due to the development of a new protocol with a set of phases for data transmission, energy consumption minimization, and void hole avoidance and mitigation in UWSN, the number of active nodes rate increases with the improvement in overall QoS.

AB This article is concerned with the problem of planning optimal maneuver trajectories and guiding the mobile robot toward target positions in uncertain environments for exploration purposes. A hierarchical deep learning-based control framework is proposed which consists of an upper level motion planning layer and a lower level waypoint tracking layer. In the motion planning phase, a recurrent deep neural network (RDNN)-based algorithm is adopted to predict the optimal maneuver profiles for the mobile robot. This approach is built upon a recently proposed idea of using deep neural networks (DNNs) to approximate the optimal motion trajectories, which has been validated that a fast approximation performance can be achieved. To further enhance the network prediction performance, a recurrent network model capable of fully exploiting the inherent relationship between preoptimized system state and control pairs is advocated. In the lower level, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based collision-free control algorithm is established to achieve the waypoint tracking task in an uncertain environment (e.g., the existence of unexpected obstacles). Since this approach allows the control policy to directly learn from human demonstration data, the time required by the training process can be significantly reduced. Moreover, a noisy prioritized experience replay (PER) algorithm is proposed to improve the exploring rate of control policy. The effectiveness of applying the proposed deep learning-based control is validated by executing a number of simulation and experimental case studies. The simulation result shows that the proposed DRL method outperforms the vanilla PER algorithm in terms of training speed. Experimental videos are also uploaded, and the corresponding results confirm that the proposed strategy is able to fulfill the autonomous exploration mission with improved motion planning performance, enhanced collision avoidance ability, and less training time.

AB Demand response programs are essential to enable accommodating larger shares of variable power generation based on renewable sources, the deployment of which is imperative for decarbonizing the economy and mitigating global warming. Consumers/prosumers are increasingly exposed to and may benefit from timedifferentiated energy prices aimed to induce changes in regular consumption patterns. These changes are also beneficial for retailers and grid operators in face of the variability of wholesale market prices, renewable energy availability and grid conditions. The optimization models to be implemented in autonomous home energy management systems require a rigorous modeling of appliance operation to generate effective load scheduling solutions, respecting their physical operation principles and use patterns in everyday life. A balance should be sought between the detail level of optimization models and the computational requirements to generate usable solutions having in mind their implementation in low-cost processors. This paper presents a comprehensive and modular set of mixed-integer linear programming models aimed at enabling their seamless incorporation in home energy management systems, allowing for the integrated optimization of all energy resources (exchanges with the grid, load management, electric vehicle and stationary battery, local microgeneration). Detailed energy consumption optimization models for shiftable, interruptible and thermostatic loads are presented, also including the power cost component and ways of dealing with user's discomfort. The modular models are presented in a building block manner enhancing the flexibility of their utilization in overall models with different objective functions encompassing the economic and comfort dimensions. Computational results are presented for a case study using actual data, which considers a time-of-use tariff with six periods. In addition to comparing with a plain tariff scheme, different consumer profiles are simulated to assess the impact of comfort requirements on cost. These results show that whenever consumers have the flexibility to change their consumption patterns, they are able to lower the net electricity bill by having an energy management system endowed with the models herein proposed to make optimized decisions on their behalf.

AB We live, it is said, in the age of "data science". Machine learning (ML) from data astonishes us with its advances, such as autonomous vehicles and translation tools, and also worries us with its ability to monitor and interpret human faces, gestures and behaviors. In science, we are witnessing a new explosion of literature around machine learning, capable of interpreting massive amounts of data, otherwise known as "big data". Some predict that numerical computation will soon be overtaken by ML as a tool for understanding and predicting dynamic systems.
   No field of science is as closely related to HPC as meteorology and climate science. Their history dates back to the dawn of numerical computation, the technology that von Neumann and his colleagues pioneered in the post-war era. In this article, we will use the numerical simulation of the Earth system as an example to highlight some of the fundamental questions posed by machine learning. We will return to the history of meteorology to understand the dialectic between knowledge-our understanding of the atmosphere-and forecasting, for example the knowledge of the weather of the next day. This question is raised again today by learning, because it is not necessarily possible to interpret physically because it comes directly from the data. On the other hand, the central role of Earth system simulation to help us decipher the future of the planet and climate change, requires us to get out of the actuality of the data and make comparisons with fictitious Earths (without industrial emissions for example) and several leads to the future, what we call "scenarios". Here observations do have a role, but it is often data from simulations that are analyzed. Finally, these climate data have a societal weight, and the democratization of access to them has grown strongly in recent years. We will show here some aspects of the evolution of simulation and data technologies and its important stakes for Earth system sciences.

AB Waste stabilisation ponds (WSPs) are used worldwide for wastewater treatment, and throughout their operation require periodic sludge surveys. Sludge accumulation in WSPs can impact performance by reducing the effective volume of the pond, and altering the pond hydraulics and wastewater treatment efficiency. Traditionally, sludge heights, and thus sludge volume, have been measured using low-resolution and labour intensive methods such as 'sludge judge' and the 'white towel test'. A sonar device, a readily available technology, fitted to a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) was shown to improve the spatial resolution and accuracy of sludge height measurements, as well as reduce labour and safety requirements. Coupled with a dedicated software package, the profiling of several WSPs has shown that the ROV with autonomous sonar device is capable of providing sludge bathymetry with greatly increased spatial resolution in a greatly reduced profiling time, leading to a better understanding of the role played by sludge accumulation in hydraulic performance of WSPs. The high-resolution bathymetry collected was used to support a much more detailed hydrodynamic assessment of systems with low, medium and high accumulations of sludge. The results of the modelling show that hydraulic performance is not only influenced by the sludge accumulation, but also that the spatial distribution of sludge plays a critical role in reducing the treatment capacity of these systems. In a range of ponds modelled, the reduction in residence time ranged from 33% in a pond with a uniform sludge distribution to a reduction of up to 60% in a pond with highly channelized flow. The combination of high-resolution measurement of sludge accumulation and hydrodynamic modelling will help in the development of frameworks for wastewater sludge management, including the development of more reliable computer models, and could potentially have wider application in the monitoring of other small to medium water bodies, such as channels, recreational water bodies, and commercial ports.

ID FORECASTING ELECTRICITY DEMAND; PRICES
AB The electrical grid is gradually transitioning towards being an interconnected area of the smart grid, where embedded devices operate in an autonomous manner without any human intervention. An important element for this transition is the energy demand prediction, since the needs for energy have substantially increased due to the introduction of new and heavy consumption sources, such as electric vehicles. Accurate energy demand prediction, especially for short-term durations (i.e., minutes to hours), allows grid operators to produce the substantial amount needed to satisfy the demand-response equilibrium and avoid peak electricity load conditions that may also lead to blackouts in densely populated areas. However, to achieve such an accuracy level, machine learning (ML) models require extensive training with historical measurements, which is usually resource intensive (e.g., in memory and processing power). Hence, deriving accurate predictions for short-term energy demands is challenging due to the absence of external factors such as environmental data from different regions and seasons and categorical values such as bank/bridging holidays in the ML model. Additionally, existing work focuses on ML model execution on Cloud platforms, which usually does not satisfy the real-time requirements of grid operators for short-term energy demand predictions. To address these challenges, this article presents a new method that considers environmental factors and categorical values to build an energy profile for each consumer in a multi-access edge computing (MEC) framework. The method is also based on the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) ML model, which allows it to learn the temporal dependencies of the gathered historical measurements and predict energy demands with satisfying accuracy. The method is applied to a home energy management system testbed containing photovoltaic systems, smart meters, sensors and actuators for detecting environmental factors (i.e., temperature, humidity and radiation) as well as energy storage systems as an additional energy supply source. The MEC framework is deployed in data concentrator devices where the TFT ML model is executed with low resource requirements, ensuring additional security as the data do not leave the location where they are produced.

AB The security and reliability of cellular-based wireless IoT networks are often hindered by eavesdropping attacks. Existing approaches have limitations such as ineffective relay selection, untrusted relay nodes, and improper UAV positioning. This article discusses secure and reliable communication in blockchain-enabled cellular-based IoT networks. In this article, we propose a novel approach that ensures the initial level of security to the UAV relays by enrolling the UAV relay nodes to the edge-assisted base stations for initial security and enhances the optimal UAV relay selection using dual-phase optimal relay selection mechanisms. This article performs authentication of UAV relay nodes to enhance security against active eavesdroppers and mitigates the effects of passive eavesdroppers by jointly optimizing power and position based on their actions. This enables eavesdropping to resist secure communication. The proposed approach beats the state-of-the-art algorithm in terms of decreased deployment time and gradually rising efficiency with increasing UEs. The deployment time for the previously presented algorithm is fast expanding, while the proposed integrated deployment algorithm is progressively increasing. The proposed eavesdropping resisted integration technique harvests an overlay complexity tendency due to its hybrid solution, enhancing system stability and minimizing system complexity. We further integrate the blockchain with UAVs in the system and perform authentication and appropriate relay selection in the networks. We will also demonstrate secure and reliable communication in healthcare, transportation, and industry. This paper emphasizes the significance of safe and dependable IoT connectivity and how blockchain technology and appropriate relay selection techniques might be helpful. The results show that the recommended algorithm is superior in terms of both reliability and complexity. When iteration count is minimal, the proposed method and the completely distributed have a comparable but lowest complexity as they outperform one another in different scenarios. Our proposed approach provides a possible solution to existing issues and contributes to the progress of secure and reliable communication in cellular-based wireless IoT networks.

AB The age of acceleration is taking place, driven by the revolutionary digital transformation creating basically a digital version of the physical world. Massive amount of data has thus been generated ranging from wearable devices monitoring our physical health every single millisecond to autonomous vehicles generating an order of magnitude of Terabytes hourly to even astronomical activities producing an order of Exabytes on a daily basis and then ultra-broadband Internet comes into play, moving such data to the cloud. As a result, Internet traffic has been experiencing explosive growth and in this context, optical transport networks forming the backbone of the Internet are pushed for transformation in system capacity. While the intuitive solution of deploying multiple fibers can address the pressing demand for increased capacity, doing so does not bring improvements in economic of scales with respect to cost, power consumption and spectral efficiency. This necessitates for a complementary approach so that the fiber capacity could be utilized in a more efficient manner. Indeed, optical-processing-enabled network has been emerging as a new architectural paradigm to attain greater fiber capacity thanks to permitting the superposition of in-transit lightpaths at intermediate nodes for optical signal processing purposes. In this paper, we focus on innovative techniques, that is, photonic network coding and partial protection, to reduce the effective traffic load for optical transport networks adopting optical-processing-enabled architecture. Specifically, the application of photonic network coding is investigated by upgrading the functionalities of intermediate nodes with all-optical processing (i.e., encoding and decoding) capabilities. Besides, partial protection relying on the premise of providing just enough bandwidth in case of failure events is exploited for saving the redundant protection capacity. That it takes two to tango, combining photonic network coding and partial protection therefore bring to light new opportunities and challenges. In mining such new avenue, we present insights on how to derive compounding gains to maximize spectral efficiency via a case study.

AB Underwater autonomous vehicles (UAVs) actuated by smart actuators have attracted increasing attention. A miniature macro fiber composite (MFC)-actuated robot fish inspired by koi fish is developed. A cantilever mechanism is designed to transfer the dynamic micro thrust of the robot fish. Three design indexes, namely the bending stiffness, the ratio of the bending stiffness to the torsional stiffness, and the natural frequency of the cantilever transducer are proposed. Thus, a simple and effective method to determine the structural parameters of the cantilever-based micro thrust force measurement system is presented. Calibration results demonstrated that the parameters of the proposed cantilever transducer match well with the designed indexes. Dynamic variation mechanisms of the micro thrust force associated with the swimming behaviors of the robot fish are well captured using the proposed measurement system. Experimental results show that the MFC-actuated robot fish obtains the biggest mean thrust of 1.73 mN in the case of the largest oscillating velocity. The maximum instant thrust grows with the increment of the oscillating frequency, and achieves its maximum of 7.35 mN in the case of 10 Hz. While the maximum instant drag first decreases then increases as the actuation frequency increases, and obtains its minimum of -2.62 mN in the case of the maximum oscillating velocity. On the contrary, variations of the thrust pattern/oscillating period are reversed to those of the maximum instant drag. Computational fluid dynamics results demonstrate that variations of the instant thrust are fully determined by the distribution and intensity of the concentrated pressure regions induced by the oscillating caudal fin. The cycle-averaged velocity fields are closely related to the mean thrust generated by the MFC-actuated robot fish. As a result, the fluid-structure interaction mechanisms associated with the thrust variations of the MFC-actuated robot fish are revealed. This study may be useful for the design and realization of UAVs actuated by smart actuators.

AB Multi-view image sensing is currently gaining momentum, fostered by new applications such as autonomous vehicles and self-propelled robots. In this paper, we prototype and evaluate a multi-view smart vision system for object recognition. The system exploits an optimized Multi-View Convolutional Neural Network (MVCNN) in which the processing is distributed among several sensors (heads) and a camera body. The main challenge for designing such a system comes from the computationally expensive work-load of real-time MVCNNs which is difficult to support with embedded processing and high frame rates. This paper focuses on the decisions to be taken for distributing an MVCNN on the camera heads, each camera head embedding a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for processing images on the stream. In particular, we show that the first layer of the AlexNet network can be processed at the nearest of the sensors, by performing a Direct Hardware Mapping (DHM) using a dataflow model of computation. The feature maps produced by the first layers are merged and processed by a camera central processing node that executes the remaining layers. The proposed system exploits state-of-the-art deep learning optimization methods, such as parameter removing and data quantization. We demonstrate that accuracy drops caused by these optimizations can be compensated by the multi-view nature of the captured information. Experimental results conducted with the AlexNet CNN show that the proposed partitioning and resulting optimizations can fit the first layer of the multi-view network in low-end FPGAs. Among all the tested configurations, we propose 2 setups with an equivalent accuracy compared to the original network on the ModelNet40 dataset. The first one is composed of 4 cameras based on a Cyclone III E120 FPGA to embed the least expensive version in terms of logic resources while the second version requires 2 cameras based on a Cyclone 10 GX220 FPGA. This distributed computing with workload reduction is demonstrated to be a practical solution when building a real-time multi-view smart camera processing several frames per second.

AB An underwater glider is an autonomous underwater vehicle that observes oceanographic data while following way points. Underwater gliders can be operated remotely, regardless of dangerous sea states such as typhoons, and have the advantage of acquiring high-resolution three-dimensional oceanographic data over large areas and long time periods. Here, we present water temperature and salinity data observed by an underwater glider following the ship conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) survey line 105 off the east coast of Korea for a period of 30 days (20 August-20 September 2018). In total, the underwater glider traveled 450 km horizontally in two round trips along the survey line at depths of approximately 200 m. The CTD profile data from the underwater glider and the ship were compared at three sites on the survey line. The root mean square error of the water temperature and salinity measured by the underwater glider and the ship at site 105-8 were 0.08-0.10 degrees C, and 0.02-0.17 psu, respectively. Overall, the distribution, range, and variability of the data collected by the underwater glider and the ship were similar at this site. The underwater glider was able to continuously observe changes in water temperature and salinity between the sites during Typhoon Soulik. Following the passage of the typhoon, the surface water temperature at site 105-7 decreased by 2.68 degrees C and salinity increased by 0.87 psu; at site 105-9, temperature decreased by 3.54 degrees C and salinity increased by 0.44 psu. These changes were caused by vertical mixing of surface water with sub-surface water during the typhoon. The mesoscale vertical mixing effect of the typhoon was examined using zonal hydrographic section measurements of temperature and salinity data. Our findings demonstrate the suitability of using underwater gliders off the east coast of Korea for long-term observations of mesoscale variability in water temperature and salinity.

AB Collaboration between multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to set up a Flying Ad Hoc Network (FANET) is a growing trend since future applications claim for more autonomous and rapid deployable systems. The user experience on watching videos transmitted over FANETs should always be satisfactory even under influence of topology changes caused by the energy consumption of UAVs. In addition, the FANET must keep the UAVs cooperating as much as possible during a mission. However, one of the main challenges in FANET is how to mitigate the impact of limited energy resources of UAVs on the FANET operation in order to monitor the environment for a long period of time. In this sense, UAV replacement is required in order to avoid the premature death of nodes, network disconnections, route failures, void areas, and low-quality video transmissions. In addition, decision-making must take into account energy consumption associated with UAV movements, since they are generally quite energy-intensive. This article proposes a cooperative UAV scheme for enhancing video transmission and global energy efficiency called VOEI. The main goal of VOEI is to maintain the video with QoE support while supporting the nodes with a good connectivity quality level and flying for a long period of time. Based on an Software Defined Network (SDN) paradigm, the VOEI assumes the existence of a centrailized controller node to compute reliable and energy-efficiency routes, as well as detects the appropriate moment for UAV replacement by considering global FANET context information to provide energy-efficiency operations. Based on simulation results, we conclude that VOEI can effectively mitigate the energy challenges of FANET, since it provides energy-efficiency operations, avoiding network death, route failure, and void area, as well as network partitioning compared to state-of-the-art algorithm. In addition, VOEI delivers videos with suitable Quality of Experience (QoE) to end-users at any time, which is not achieved by the state-of-the-art algorithm.

AB The ability to accurately predict others' behavior is central to the safety and efficiency of robotic systems in interactive settings, such as human-robot interaction and multi-robot teaming tasks. Unfortunately, robots often lack access to key information on which these predictions may hinge, such as other agents' goals, attention, and willingness to cooperate. Dual control theory addresses this challenge by treating unknown parameters of a predictive model as stochastic hidden states and inferring their values at runtime using information gathered during system operation. While able to optimally and automatically trade off exploration and exploitation, dual control is computationally intractable for general interactive motion planning, mainly due to the fundamental coupling between the robot's trajectory plan and its prediction of other agents' intent. In this paper, we present a novel algorithmic approach to enable active uncertainty reduction for interactive motion planning based on the implicit dual control paradigm. Our approach relies on sampling-based approximation of stochastic dynamic programming, leading to a model predictive control problem that can be readily solved by real-time gradient-based optimization methods. The resulting policy is shown to preserve the dual control effect for a broad class of predictive models with both continuous and categorical uncertainty. To ensure the safe operation of the interacting agents, we use a runtime safety filter (also referred to as a "shielding" scheme), which overrides the robot's dual control policy with a safety fallback strategy when a safety-critical event is imminent. We then augment the dual control framework with an improved variant of the recently proposed shielding-aware robust planning scheme, which proactively balances the nominal planning performance with the risk of high-cost emergency maneuvers triggered by low-probability agent behaviors. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with both simulated driving studies and hardware experiments using 1/10 scale autonomous vehicles.

AB Rocks are one of the major surface features of Mars. The accurate characterization of the chemical and mineralogical composition of Martian rocks would yield significant evolutionary information about relevant geological processes and exobiological exploration. Many existing rock recognition systems generally assume that all testing classes are known during training. Over real planetary surfaces, the autonomous recognition system is likely to encounter an unknown category of rock that is crucial to the performance of the rock classification task. Therefore, we develop an open-set Martian rock-type classification framework based on their spectral signatures, with the subgoal of new/unknown rock-type recognition and category-incremental learning for expanding the recognition model. First, the spectral signatures of rock samples are captured to characterize their mineralogical compositions and physical properties, which serves as the input of the developed framework. To further produce the highly discriminative feature representation from the original spectral signatures, a transformer architecture integrated with contrastive learning is constructed and trained in an end-to-end manner to force instances of the same class to remain close-by while pushing those of a dissimilar class farther apart. Following this, according to the extreme value theorem (EVT), category-specific distance distribution analysis is conducted to detect and identify new/unknown types of rock samples due to the isolated characteristics of new/unknown rock samples in the latent feature space. Finally, the recognition model is incrementally updated to learn these identified "unknown" samples without forgetting previously known categories when the associated labels are progressively obtained. The multispectral camera, a duplicated payload of the counterpart onboard the Zhurong rover, is used as the multispectral sensor for capturing the spectral information of the laboratory rock dataset shared by the National Mineral Rock and Fossil Specimens Resource Center for both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness and robustness of the developed in situ analysis framework.

AB Many distribution centers use expensive, conveyor-based sorting systems that require large buildings to house them. In areas with tight space, robotic sorting systems offer a new type of solution to sort parcels by destination. Such systems are highly flexible in throughput capacity and are now gradually being introduced, particularly in express companies. This paper studies robotic sorting system with two layouts. The first layout has two tiers: robots drive on the top tier and sort parcels by destination on spiral conveyors connected to roll containers at the lower tier. The second layout has a single tier with input and output points located at the perimeter, connected by robots. For each layout, we consider both the shortest path topology via dual-lane aisles and the detour path topology via single-lane aisles. We build closed queueing networks for performance estimation, design an iterative procedure to investigate robot congestion in the two-tier layout, and use a traffic flow function to estimate robot congestion in the single-tier layout. Random, closest, dedicated, and shortest-queue robot-to-loading-station assignment rules are examined. We validate analytical models by both simulation and a real case of Deppon Express and analyze the optimal system size and operating policies for throughput capacity and operating cost. The results show that the system throughput capacity is significantly affected by robot congestion in the single-tier layout with the detour path topology, but it is only slightly affected in the other systems. A square layout fits the shortest path and a rectangular layout fits the detour path. Both the random assignment rule and the shortest queue assignment rule are superior for a large number of robots, whereas the dedicated assignment rule is superior for a small number of robots. We apply these insights at Deppon Express for different allocations in peak and off-peak hours. Our analysis shows that a robotic sorting system typically has lower overall annual cost than a traditional cross belt sorting system when the required throughput capacity is not too large.

AB Across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) there is a narrow engineering corridor with widely distributed slopes called the Qinghai-Tibet Engineering Corridor (QTEC), where a variety of important infrastructures are concentrated. These facilities are transportation routes for people, materials, energy, etc. from inland China to the Tibet Autonomous Region. From Golmud to Lhasa, the engineering corridor covers 632 km of permafrost containing the densely developed Qinghai-Tibet Railway and Qinghai-Tibet Highway, as well as power and communication towers. Slope failure in permafrost regions, caused by permafrost degradation, ground ice melting, etc., affects the engineering construction and permafrost environments in the QTEC. We implement a variety of sensors to monitor the hydrological and thermal deformation between permafrost slopes and permafrost engineering projects in the corridor. In addition to soil temperature and moisture sensors, the global navigation satellite system (GNSS), terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were adopted to monitor the spatial distribution and changes in thermal deformation. An integrated dataset of hydrological and thermal deformation in permafrost engineering and slopes in the QTEC from the 1950s to 2020, including meteorological and ground observations, TLS point cloud data, and RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) images, can be of great value for estimating the hydrological and thermal impact and stability between engineering and slopes under the influence of climate change and engineering disturbance. The dataset and code were uploaded to the Zenodo repository and can be accessed through https://zenodo.org/communities/qtec (last access: 23 June 2021), including meteorological and ground observations at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5009871 (Luo et al., 2020d), TLS measurements at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5009558 (Luo et al., 2020a), UAV RGB and TIR images at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5016192 (Luo et al., 2020b), and R code for permafrost indices and visualisation at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5002981 (Luo et al., 2020c).

AB Along with Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is becoming a new computing paradigm that enables accommodating innovative applications and services with stringent response delay and resource requirements, including autonomous vehicles and augmented reality. Provisioning reliable network services for users is the top priority of most network service providers, as unreliable services or severe service failures can result in tremendous losses of users, particularly for their mission-critical applications. In this paper, we study reliability-aware VNF instances provisioning in an MEC, where different users request different network services with different reliability requirements through paying their requested services with the aim to maximize the network throughput. To this end, we first formulate a novel reliability-aware VNF instance placement problem by provisioning primary and secondary VNF instances at different cloudlets in MEC for each user while meeting the specified reliability requirement of the user request. We then show that the problem is NP-hard and formulate an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solution. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we instead devise an approximation algorithm with a logarithmic approximation ratio for the problem. Moreover, we also consider two special cases of the problem. For one special case where each request only requests one primary and one secondary VNF instances, the problem is still NP-hard, and we devise a constant approximation algorithm for it. For another special case where different VNFs have the same amounts of computing resource demands, we show that it is polynomial-time solvable by developing a dynamic programming solution for it. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through experimental simulations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are promising, and the empirical results of the algorithms outperform their analytical counterparts as theoretical estimations usually are very conservative.

AB For millions of years, aquatic species have utilized the principles of unsteady hydrodynamics to perform efficient, highly maneuverable and silent swimming motions. The manta ray, Manta birostris, has been identified as one such high performance species due to their ability to migrate long distances with low energy consumption, maneuver in spaces the size of their tip-to-tip wing span, produce enough thrust to leap out of the water and attain sustained swimming speeds of 2.8 m/s with low flapping frequencies. These characteristics make the manta ray an ideal candidate to emulate in the design of a bio-inspired autonomous underwater vehicle. The enlarged pectoral fins of the manta ray undergo complex motions that couple a curved spanwise deformation with a chordwise traveling wave to produce thrust and to maneuver. To produce an artificial pectoral fin that achieves this compound deformation while supporting large force generation, a tensegrity-based solution is developed. Various actuation strategies that are capable of matching these key kinematic features are explored and compared. Analytical solutions for active planar tensegrity beam structures are derived. These solutions allow for the direct calculation of optimal parameter values without the need to perform an exhaustive parametric study using a numerical solution. Moreover, the analytical solutions provide physical insight into the mechanics of tensegrity beams. Building on previous studies of active tensegrity structures, the loading response of different actuation strategies has been investigated analytically and is validated by a nonlinear numerical model and experiments. Optimal stiffness-to-mass and strength-to-mass strategies have been identified. Utilizing the analytical predictions for the optimal solution, an example design of a tensegrity-based artificial pectoral fin is shown. Structural performance metrics were calculated showing that the fin structure can closely match the kinematics of the manta ray, under external loading, using open-loop actuation of four actuators remotely located outside of the active structure. This approach costs minimal power consumption and shows the simple design of a high performance tensegrity-based artificial pectoral fin. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Inversion of near-bottom magnetic data reveals a well-defined low crustal magnetization zone (LMZ) near a local topographic high (37 degrees 47' S, 49 degrees 39' E) on the ultraslow-spreading Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR). The magnetic data were collected by the autonomous underwater vehicle ABE on board R/V DaYangYiHao in February-March 2007. The first active hydrothermal vent field observed on the SWIR is located in Area A within and adjacent to the LMZ at the local topographic high, implying that this LMZ may be the result of hydrothermal alteration of magnetic minerals. The maximum reduction in crustal magnetization is 3 A/M. The spatial extent of the LMZ is estimated to be at least 6.7 x 10(4) m(2), which is larger than that of the LMZs at the TAG vent field on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), as well as the Relict Field, Bastille, Dante-Grotto, and New Field vent-sites on the Juan de Fuca Ridge (JdF). The calculated magnetic moment, i.e., the product of the spatial extent and amplitude of crustal magnetization reduction is at least -3 x 10(7) Am(2) for the LMZ on the SWIR, while that for the TAG field on theMARis -8 x 10(7) Am(2) and that for the four individual vent fields on the JdF range from -5 x 10(7) to -3 x 10(7) Am(2). Together these results indicate that crustal demagnetization is a common feature of basalt-hosted hydrothermal vent fields at mid-ocean ridges of all spreading rates. Furthermore, the crustal demagnetization of the Area A on the ultraslow-spreading SWIR is comparable in strength to that of the TAG area on the slow-spreading MAR. Citation: Zhu, J., J. Lin, Y. J.

ID SOIL COMPACTION; SYSTEMS; TILLAGE; ECONOMICS
AB Controlled-traffic farming (CTF) is a management system that can eliminate soil compaction by wheels within the cropped area. According to the principles of CTF, permanent parallel wheel tracks are created within the field area. The benefits of CTF, in terms of productivity and sustainability, have been the subject of intensive research for a number of decades. This has led to the establishment of CTF in various regions around the world. CTF also has drawbacks that include the need to purchase specialised machinery, the loss of cropped area due to dedicated wheel tracks and the cost of creating and maintaining permanent traffic lanes within the fields. Furthermore, field efficiency is affected by CTF due to significant increases in idle time of in-field transport and the way the fields are traversed in material handling operations. During fertilisation, when tramline length and the driving distance needed to apply one tanker load of fertiliser are not coordinated, CTF does not allow for random turns and requires the tanker to drive empty along the traffic path. The inherent characteristics of the CTF system, as well as the fact that cooperatively owned machines are used to carry out the operations, makes existing models inadequate for evaluating field efficiency.
   In this paper, the development of a discrete-event model for the prediction of travelled distances of a machine operating in material handling operations using the concept of CTF is presented. The model is based on the mathematical formulation of the discrete events regarding the motion of the machine when performing the fieldwork pattern. To evaluate the model two slurry application experiments were designed. The experiments involved registering the position and monitoring the application status of the slurry applicator. Validation showed that the model could adequately predict the motion pattern of machinery operating in CTF. Prediction errors of total distance travelled, were 0.24% and 1.41% for the 2 experimental setups. The current model structure captures the interrelationships between the mutual influencing parameters of motion sequence and configurations of the CTF layout. This model has the potential to be used for autonomous vehicles. (C) 2009 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A detailed theoretical design and technological implementation aspects are presented in this paper to address the aerial formation control problem of networked quadrotors with a fixed-time stability property. The control algorithm is embedded in a distributed fashion onboard each quadrotor along with a leader-follower scheme. The dynamics of the vehicles are subject to disturbances and nonlinearities. Given the communication topology within the graph, a Distributed Fixed-Time Consensus Observer (DFCO) is designed for the followers that are not all directly informed of the leader's states. An output-feedback control is employed in the position-loop to ensure robust and velocity-free control where only the position of the quadrotors is measurable. Then, inspired by the homogeneity theory, a novel Homogeneous Nonsingular Terminal Sliding Function (HNTSF) that guarantees Global Asymptotic Stability (GAS) in the bi-limit approximation is designed for the position states. Subsequently, a Fixed-time Distributed Non-switching Nonsingular Formation Control Protocol (FDNNFCP) is proposed for the position-loop of each follower aircraft. Also, a Trajectory Tracking Controller (TTC) is designed for the leader. A Modified Robust Homogeneous-based Continuous Twisting Control (MRHCTC) with improved performance is developed to stabilize the attitude-loop. Considering the overall feedback system, the presented work provides a rigorous stability analysis through the bi-limit homogeneity theory and Lyapunov theorem. Moreover, Processor-In-the-Loop (PIL) simulations, ROS/Gazebo implementation, and outdoor flight experiments are conducted to characterize the control performance. Compared with relevant and recent literature on finite-time/fixed-time controllers besides the well-known Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller, the proposed control approach achieves superior performance in practice since: (i) Convergence-time of the quadrotors to the formation does not depend on their initial positions; (H) Chattering issue of switching and discontinuous control approaches is mitigated; (Hi) Null steady-state error is ensured along with improved robustness.

AB In this article, we presented mmPose-NLP, a novel natural language processing (NLP) inspired sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) skeletal key-point estimator using millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to precisely estimate up to 25 skeletal key points using mmWave radar data alone. Skeletal pose estimation is critical in several applications ranging from autonomous vehicles, traffic monitoring, patient monitoring, and gait analysis, to defense security forensics, and aid both preventative and actionable decision making. The use of mmWave radars for this task, over traditionally employed optical sensors, provides several advantages, primarily its operational robustness to scene lighting and adverse weather conditions, where optical sensor performance degrade significantly. The mmWave radar point-cloud (PCL) data are first voxelized (analogous to tokenization in NLP) and N frames of the voxelized radar data (analogous to a text paragraph in NLP) is subjected to the proposed mmPose-NLP architecture, where the voxel indices of the 25 skeletal key points (analogous to keyword extraction in NLP) are predicted. The voxel indices are converted back to real-world 3-D coordinates using the voxel dictionary used during the tokenization process. Mean absolute error (MAE) metrics were used to measure the accuracy of the proposed system against the ground truth, with the proposed mmPose-NLP offering <3 cm localization errors in the depth, horizontal, and vertical axes. The effect of the number of input frames versus performance/accuracy was also studied for N = {1,2,...,10}. A comprehensive methodology, results, discussions, and limitations are presented in this article. All the source codes and results are made available on GitHub for further research and development in this critical yet emerging domain of skeletal key-point estimation using mmWave radars.

AB The terrestrial networks face the challenges of severe cost inefficiency and low feasibility to provide seamless services anytime and anywhere, especially in the extreme or hotspot areas (e.g., disaster areas, mountains, and oceans) due to limited service coverage and capacity. The integration of multi-dimensional networks consisting of space, air, and ground layers is expected to provide solutions in delivering cost-effective and ubiquitous Internet of things (IoT) services for billions of users and interconnected smart devices. Autonomous data collection, exchange, and processing across different network segments with minimal human interventions in space-air-ground IoT (SAG-IoT) can bring great convenience to consumers, however, it also suffers new attacks from intruders. Severe privacy invasion, reliability issues, and security breaches of SAG-IoT can hinder its wide deployment. The emerging blockchain holds great potentials to address the security concerns in SAG-IoT, thanks to its prominent features of decentralization, transparency, immutability, traceability, and auditability. Despite of the benefits of blockchain-empowered SAG-IoT, there exist a series of fundamental challenges in terms of efficiency and regulation due to the intrinsic characteristics of SAG-IoT (e.g., heterogeneity, time-variability, and poor interoperability) and the limitations of existing blockchain approaches (e.g., capacity and scalability). This article presents a comprehensive survey of the integration of blockchain technologies for securing SAG-IoT applications. Specifically, we first discuss the architecture, characteristics, and security threats of SAG-IoT systems. Then, we concentrate on the promising blockchain-based solutions for SAG-IoT security. Next, we discuss the critical challenges when integrating blockchain in SAG-IoT security services and review the state-of-the-art solutions. We further investigate the opportunities of blockchain in artificial intelligence and beyond 5G networks and provide open research directions for building future blockchain-empowered SAG-IoT systems.

AB The Sinkiang Uygur Autonomous Region is located in western China and the centre of the Asian-European continent, which frequently suffers from sandstorm disasters and haze weathers. A 1-year measurement campaign in two selected points in Shihezi and Urumqi of Sinkiang was conducted to characterise the effects of particle matters and factors on particle extinction under different weather conditions. Results showed that the average concentration of PM1-2.5 was 19.83, 9.230, 28.93 and 122.4 mu g/m(3) in Shihezi and 67.25, 16.80, 59.19 and 324.0 mu g/m(3) in Urumqi for spring, summer, autumn and winter, respectively. PM5-10 concentrations can reach up to 500.0 and 160.0 mu g/m(3) during polluted weather conditions in Shihezi and Urumqi, respectively. PM5-10 also accounted for the largest fraction in Shihezi and Urumqi for all types of weather, reaching up to 40.0% under dusty weather conditions. PM1-2.5 significantly increased during winter possibly due to the increased demand for heating compared with non-heating periods. PM0.5-1 is possibly produced from motor vehicle exhaust. Particle size is concluded to be the dominant factor for particle extinction capability under fine weather based on calculations of aerosol optical properties. The refractive index for a particle with a diameter of 100 mu m (3.10-3.11i) is substantially larger than that with a diameter of 0.5000 mu m (1.600-0.07000i), but the extinction capability of the latter is 1.30 times that of the former. Comparatively, when the mass concentration of coarse particles is over 17.0 times that of the fine particles, and then mass concentration becomes the dominant factor. Therefore, visibility is negatively correlated to particle mass variations during dust storms and hazy days but not for fine days.

AB The potential for imminent polymetallic nodule mining in the Clarion Clipperton Fracture Zone (CCZ) has attracted considerable scientific and public attention. This concern stems from both the extremely large seafloor areas that may be impacted by mining, and the very limited knowledge of the fauna and ecology of this region. The environmental factors regulating seafloor ecology are still very poorly understood. In this study, we focus on megafaunal ecology in the proposed conservation zone 'Area of Particular Environmental Interest 6' (study area centred 17 degrees 16'N, 122 degrees 55'W). We employ bathymetric data to objectively define three landscape types in the area (a level bottom Flat, an elevated Ridge, a depressed Trough; water depth 3950-4250 m) that are characteristic of the wider CCZ. We use direct seabed sampling to characterise the sedimentary environment in each landscape, detecting no statistically significant differences in particle size distributions or organic matter content. Additional seafloor characteristics and data on both the metazoan and xenophyophore components of the megafauna were derived by extensive photographic survey from an autonomous underwater vehicle. Image data revealed that there were statistically significant differences in seafloor cover by nodules and in the occurrence of other hard substrata habitat between landscapes. Statistically significant differences in megafauna standing stock, functional structuring, diversity, and faunal composition were detected between landscapes. The Flat and Ridge areas exhibited a significantly higher standing stock and a distinct assemblage composition compared to the Trough. Geomorphological variations, presumably regulating local bottom water flows and the occurrence of nodule and xenophyophore test substrata, between study areas may be the mechanism driving these assemblage differences. We also used these data to assess the influence of sampling unit size on the estimation of ecological parameters. We discuss these results in the contexts of regional benthic ecology and the appropriate management of potential mining activities in the CCZ and elsewhere in the deep ocean.

AB Nighttime driving is more dangerous than daytime driving-particularly for senior drivers. Three to four times as many driving-related deaths occur at night than in the daytime. To improve the safety of night driving, automatic pedestrian detection based on infrared images has drawn increased attention because pedestrians tend to stand out more against the background in infrared images than they do in visible light images. Nevertheless, pedestrian detection in infrared images is by no means trivial-many of the known difficulties carry over from visible light images, such as image variability occasioned by pedestrians being in different poses. Typically, several different pedestrian templates have to be used in order to deal with a range of poses. Furthermore, pedestrian detection is difficult because of poor infrared image quality (low resolution, low contrast, few distinguishable feature points, little texture information, etc.) and misleading signals. To address these problems, this paper introduces a shape-independent pedestrian-detection method. Our segmentation algorithm first estimates pedestrians' horizontal locations through projection-based horizontal segmentation and then determines pedestrians' vertical locations through brightness/bodyline-based vertical segmentation. Our classification method defines multidimensional histogram-, inertia-, and contrast-based classification features. The features are shape-independent, complementary to one another, and capture the statistical similarities of image patches containing pedestrians with different poses. Thus, our pedestrian-detection system needs only one pedestrian template-corresponding to a generic walking pose-and avoids brute-force searching for pedestrians throughout whole images, which typically involves brightness-similarity comparisons between candidate image patches and a multiplicity of pedestrian templates. Our pedestrian-detection system is neither based on tracking nor does it depend on camera calibration to determine the relationship between an object's height and its vertical image locations. Thus, it is less restricted in applicability. Even if much work is still needed to bridge the gap between present pedestrian-detection performance and the high reliability required for real-world applications, our pedestrian-detection system is straightforward and provides encouraging results in improving speed, reliability, and simplicity.

AB In many real-world problems, the range of consequences of different alternatives are considerably different. In addition, sometimes, selection of a group of alternatives (instead of only one best alternative) is necessary. Traditional decision making approaches treat the set of alternatives with the same method of analysis and selection. In this paper, we propose clustering alternatives into different groups so that different methods of analysis, selection, and implementation for each group can be applied. As an example, consider the selection of a group of functions (or tasks) to be processed by a group of processors. The set of tasks can be grouped according to their similar criteria, and hence, each cluster of tasks to be processed by a processor.
   The selection of the best alternative for each clustered group can be performed using existing methods; however, the process of selecting groups is different than the process of selecting alternatives within a group. We develop theories and procedures for clustering discrete multiple criteria alternatives. We also demonstrate how the set of alternatives is clustered into mutually exclusive groups based on 1) similar features among alternatives; 2) ideal (or most representative) alternatives given by the decision maker; and 3) other preferential information of the decision maker.
   The clustering of multiple criteria alternatives also has the following advantages. 1) It decreases the set of alternatives to be considered by the decision maker (for example, different decision makers are assigned to different groups of alternatives). 2) It decreases the number of criteria. 3) It may provide a different approach for analyzing multiple decision makers problems. Each decision maker may cluster alternatives differently, and hence, clustering of alternatives may provide a basis for negotiation.
   The developed approach is applicable for solving a class of telecommunication networks problems where a set of objects (such as routers, processors, or intelligent autonomous vehicles) are to be clustered into similar groups. Objects are clustered based on several criteria and the decision maker's preferences.

AB The proliferation of radar technology has given rise to a growing demand for advanced, high-performance transmitter front-ends operating in the 24 GHz frequency band. This paper presents a design analysis of a radio frequency (RF) transmitter (TX) front-end operated at a 24 GHz frequency and designed using 65 nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology for radar applications. The proposed TX front-end design includes the integration of an up-conversion mixer and power amplifier (PA). The up-conversion mixer is a Gilbert cell-based design that translates the 2.4 GHz intermediate frequency (IF) signal and 21.6 GHz local oscillator (LO) signal to the 24 GHz RF output signal. The mixer is designed with a novel technique that includes a duplex transconductance path (DTP) for enhancing the mixer's linearity. The DTP of the mixer includes a primary transconductance path (PTP) and a secondary transconductance path (STP). The PTP incorporates a common source (CS) amplifier, while the STP incorporates an improved cross-quad transconductor (ICQT). The integrated PA in the TX front-end is a class AB tunable two-stage PA that can be tuned with the help of varactors as a synchronous mode to increase the PA bandwidth or stagger mode to obtain a high gain. The PA is tuned to 24 GHz as a synchronous mode PA for the TX front-end operation. The proposed TX front-end showed an excellent output power of 11.7 dBm and dissipated 7.5 mW from a 1.2 V supply. In addition, the TX front-end achieved a power-added efficiency (PAE) of 47% and 1 dB compression point (OP1dB) of 10.5 dBm. In this case, the output power is 10.5 dBm higher than the linear portion of the response. The methodologies presented herein have the potential to advance the state of the art in 24 GHz radar technology, fostering innovations in fields such as autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, and remote sensing.

AB Solving the road congestion problem is one of the most pressing issues in modern cities since it causes time wasting, pollution, higher industrial costs and huge road maintenance costs. Advances in ITS technologies and the advent of autonomous vehicles are changing mobility dramatically. They enable the implementation of a coordination mechanism, called coordinated traffic assignment, among the sat-nav devices aiming at assigning paths to drivers to eliminate congestion and to reduce the total travel time in traffic networks. Among possible congestion avoidance methods, coordinated traffic assignment is a valuable choice since it does not involve huge investments to expand the road network. Traffic assignments are traditionally devoted to two main perspectives on which the well-known Wardropian principles are inspired: the user equilibrium and the system optimum. User equilibrium is a user-driven traffic assignment in which each user chooses the most convenient path selfishly. It guarantees that fairness among users is respected since, when the equilibrium is reached, all users sharing the same origin and destination will experience the same travel time. The main drawback in a user equilibrium is that the system total travel time is not minimized and, hence, the so-called Price of Anarchy is paid. On the other hand, the system optimum is an efficient system-wide traffic assignment in which drivers are routed on the network in such a way the total travel time is minimized, but users might experience travel times that are higher than the other users travelling from the same origin to the same destination, affecting the compliance. Thus, drawbacks in implementing one of the two assignments can be overcome by hybridizing the two approaches, aiming at bridging users' fairness to system-wide efficiency. In the last decades, a significant number of attempts have been done to bridge fairness among users and system efficiency in traffic assignments. The survey reviews the state-of-the-art of these trade-off approaches.

AB Recently Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have evolved considerably towards real world applications, going beyond entertaining activities and use. With the advent of Fifth Generation (5G) cellular networks and the number of UAVs to be increased significantly, it is created the opportunity for UAVs to participate in the realisation of 5G opportunistic networks by carrying 5G Base-Stations to under-served areas, allowing the provision of bandwidth demanding services, such as Ultra High Definition (UHD) video streaming, as well as other multimedia services. Among the various improvements that will drive this evolution of UAVs, energy efficiency is considered of primary importance since will prolong the flight time and will extend the mission territory. Although this problem has been studied in the literature as an offline resource optimisation problem, the diverse conditions of a real UAV flight does not allow any of the existing offline optimisation models to be applied in real flight conditions. To this end, this paper discusses the amalgamation of UAVs and 5G cellular networks as an auspicious solution for realising energy efficiency of UAVs by offloading at the edge of the network the Flight Control System (FCS), which will allow the optimisation of the UAV energy resources by processing in real time the flight data that have been collected by onboard sensors. By exploiting the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) architectural feature of 5G as a technology enabler for realising this offloading, the paper presents a proof-of-concept implementation of such a 5G-enabled UAV with softwarized FCS component at the edge of the 5G network (i.e., the MEC), allowing by this way the autonomous flight of the UAV over the 5G network by following control commands mandated by the FCS that has been deployed at the MEC. This proof-of-concept 5G-enabled UAV can support the execution of real-time resource optimisation techniques, a step-forward from the currently offline-ones, enabling in the future the execution of energy-efficient and advanced missions.

AB The successful adoption of a product or service by its target market or users relies on delivering a product or service in line with their needs and expectations. Failure to do so will likely result in a low rate of uptake or use of the product or service. This study sought to identify the criteria by which potential users of a first-/last-mile automated bus (AB) service would evaluate the service, and accordingly decide whether to use or disregard the service. This research investigated var-ious explanatory factors affecting users' perceptions of the service's quality and utility, and which enhanced or diminished their intentions to use it. The data analysed in this study was collected from a survey conducted in February and March of 2018 in Stockholm, Sweden, during a trial operation of a first-/last-mile AB service. Three-factor theory analysis, commonly used to analyse services, was applied to this data in order to identify users' core perceptions about the service, which in turn influence their intention-to-use the service. Structural equation modelling was used to identify the significant factors that influence the identified perceptions influencing the in-tention-to-use the service. This study found that different subgroups of users prioritised different attributes. Prospective users (with no prior experience with the service) were most concerned with the frequency of service. Their intention-to-use the service greatly increased when the service frequency is comparable to the service frequency of a regular public bus service. Experienced users' intentions to continue using the service greatly increased when the buses were made more comfortable. This study additionally found that users' perceptions of the service's quality were also influenced by numerous factors including the passenger's age, income level, preferred mode of travel for daily trips, preferred mode of travel for first-/last-mile trips, being tech-savvy or not, and their level of familiarity with automated driving technology.

AB Aim The Deepwater Horizon disaster resulted in the largest accidental marine oil spill in history and caused extensive injury to deep-sea habitats, including cold-water coral communities dominated by Paramuricea species. One of the primary difficulties in assessing the full extent of the injury to cold-water coral ecosystems is the extreme paucity of observational data and the subsequent lack of knowledge of their distribution within the affected region. The aim of this study was to use habitat suitability modelling to estimate the number of potentially affected Paramuricea sp. corals across the northern Gulf of Mexico.
   Location Northern Gulf of Mexico.
   Taxon Cold-water corals in the genus Paramuricea.
   Methods High-resolution (12.5 m) models were built using the maximum entropy (Maxent) approach using remotely sensed data including seafloor topography, seismic reflectivity, temperature and the amount of productivity exported from the surface. Model outputs were used to estimate the number of potential coral sites in the northern Gulf of Mexico, delineated as areas with both high habitat suitability scores and the presence of hard substrate. The number of coral sites was further adjusted using a ground-truthing procedure using autonomous underwater vehicle-transect data.
   Results Across the entire study area in the northern Gulf of Mexico, there were 558 predicted coral sites, covering an area of 14.2 km(2). Within a 2,291 km(2) region shown to have been directly affected by the spill and subsequent oil plume, there were 66 predicted coral sites covering an area of 1.2 km(2) with an average of 63 corals per site.
   Main Conclusions Our results indicate that the magnitude of injury stemming from the spill was likely far higher than previously known, and will help quantify the full extent of the losses incurred as well as prioritize disturbed areas for future research and restoration efforts.

ID ANOMALY DETECTION; SEGMENTATION
AB Automated X-ray defect inspection of occluded objects has been an essential topic in semiconductors, autonomous vehicles, and artificial intelligence devices. However, there are few solutions to segment occluded objects in the X-ray inspection efficiently. In particular, in the Ball Grid Array inspection of X-ray images, it is difficult to accurately segment the regions of occluded solder balls and detect defects inside solder balls. In this paper, we present a novel automatic inspection algorithm that segments solder balls, and detects defects fast and efficiently when solder balls are occluded. The proposed algorithm consists of two stages. In the first stage, the defective candidates or defects are determined through the following four steps: (i) image preprocessing such as noise removal, contrast enhancement, binarization, connected component, and morphology, (ii) limiting the inspec-tion area to the ball regions and determining if the ball regions are occluded, (iii) segmenting each ball region into one or more regions with similar gray values, and (iv) determining whether there are defects or defective candidates in the regions using a weighted sum of local threshold on local variance. If there are defective candidates, the determination of defects is finally made in the following stage. In the second stage, defects are detected using the automated inspection technique based on oblique computed tomography. The 3D precision inspection process is divided into four steps: (i) obtaining 360 projection images (one image per degree) rotating the object from 0 to 360 degrees, (ii) reconstructing a 3D image from the 360 projected images, (iii) finding the center slice of gravity for solder balls from the axial slice images in the z-direction, and getting the inspection intervals between the upper bound and the lower bound from the center slice, and (iv) finally determining whether there are defects in the averaged image of solder balls. The proposed hybrid algorithm is robust for segmenting the defects inside occluded solder balls, and improves the performance of solder ball segmentation and defect detection algorithm. Experimental results show an accuracy of more than 97%.

TI Hedonic Coalition Formation for Distributed Task Allocation among

ID STABILITY
AB Autonomous wireless agents such as unmanned aerial vehicles, mobile base stations, cognitive devices, or self-operating wireless nodes present a great potential for deployment in next-generation wireless networks. While current literature has been mainly focused on the use of agents within robotics or software engineering applications, this paper proposes a novel usage model for self-organizing agents suitable for wireless communication networks. In the proposed model, a number of agents are required to collect data from several arbitrarily located tasks. Each task represents a queue of packets that require collection and subsequent wireless transmission by the agents to a central receiver. The problem is modeled as a hedonic coalition formation game between the agents and the tasks that interact in order to form disjoint coalitions. Each formed coalition is modeled as a polling system consisting of a number of agents, designated as collectors, which move between the different tasks present in the coalition, collect and transmit the packets. Within each coalition, some agents might also take the role of a relay for improving the packet success rate of the transmission. The proposed hedonic coalition formation algorithm allows the tasks and the agents to take distributed decisions to join or leave a coalition, based on the achieved benefit in terms of effective throughput, and the cost in terms of polling system delay. As a result of these decisions, the agents and tasks structure themselves into independent disjoint coalitions which constitute a Nash-stable network partition. Moreover, the proposed coalition formation algorithm allows the agents and tasks to adapt the topology to environmental changes, such as the arrival of new tasks, the removal of existing tasks, or the mobility of the tasks. Simulation results show how the proposed algorithm allows the agents and tasks to self-organize into independent coalitions, while improving the performance, in terms of average player (agent or task) payoff, of at least 30.26 percent (for a network of five agents with up to 25 tasks) relatively to a scheme that allocates nearby tasks equally among agents.

AB Pressure-tolerated lithium-ion batteries have been used in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), due to their ability to withstand pressure directly and save structural parts that protect itself. As an important component of the battery, state of charge (SOC) is critical for evaluating the reliable operation of AUV batteries. The influence of hydrostatic pressure is not considered in typical SOC estimation process, which leads to a large deviation of terminal voltage estimation, and finally the accurate estimation of SOC cannot be realized. In this paper, a dual -polarized equivalent circuit model dependent on hydrostatic pressure is established, which fully considers the influence of pressure on the internal characteristic parameters of the battery. The characteristic parameters in the equivalent circuit model are measured at hydrostatic pressure and identified by forgetting factor recursive least squares (FFRLS). Compared with the blank model without considering hydrostatic pressure, the proposed model can capture voltage and SOC, which can contribute to the estimation accuracy of terminal voltage in a wide pressure range. The typical algorithms of unscented Kalman filter (UKF), cubature Kalman filter (CKF) and adaptive cubature Kalman filter (ACKF) are used to estimate the SOC based on the two models (OCV-SOC-Pressure and OCV-SOC) at different hydrostatic pressures. The results show that the accuracy of the SOC estimation algorithm under different hydrostatic pressure environments is improved, which is attributed to the compensation correction of the original OCV-SOC model. The root mean square error (RMSE) value of the ACKF algorithm based on the hydrostatic pressure adaptive multivariate regression model is 0.94 %, which significantly improves the SOC estimation effectiveness of the OCV-SOC model without considering the pressure factor (RMSE is 7.36 %) at the hydrostatic pressure of 60 MPa. At the preset different SOC initial values, the three algorithms based on the hydrostatic pressure adaptive multivariate regression model can achieve fast convergence, and ACKF shows the best environmental adaptability.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that deals with the simulation of human intelligence using machines so that such machines gain problem-solving and decision-making capabilities similar to that of the human brain. Neuroscience is the scientific study of the struczture and cognitive functions of the brain. Neuroscience and AI are mutually interrelated. These two fields help each other in their advancements. The theory of neuroscience has brought many distinct improvisations into the AI field. The biological neural network has led to the realization of complex deep neural network architectures that are used to develop versatile applications, such as text processing, speech recognition, object detection, etc. Additionally, neuroscience helps to validate the existing AI-based models. Reinforcement learning in humans and animals has inspired computer scientists to develop algorithms for reinforcement learning in artificial systems, which enables those systems to learn complex strategies without explicit instruction. Such learning helps in building complex applications, like robot-based surgery, autonomous vehicles, gaming applications, etc. In turn, with its ability to intelligently analyze complex data and extract hidden patterns, AI fits as a perfect choice for analyzing neuroscience data that are very complex. Large-scale AI-based simulations help neuroscientists test their hypotheses. Through an interface with the brain, an AI-based system can extract the brain signals and commands that are generated according to the signals. These commands are fed into devices, such as a robotic arm, which helps in the movement of paralyzed muscles or other human parts. AI has several use cases in analyzing neuroimaging data and reducing the workload of radiologists. The study of neuroscience helps in the early detection and diagnosis of neurological disorders. In the same way, AI can effectively be applied to the prediction and detection of neurological disorders. Thus, in this paper, a scoping review has been carried out on the mutual relationship between AI and neuroscience, emphasizing the convergence between AI and neuroscience in order to detect and predict various neurological disorders.

ID MOTION CAPTURE
AB With the advent of autonomous vehicles, detection of the occupants' posture is crucial to tackle the needs of infotainment interaction or passive safety systems. Generative approaches have been recently proposed for human body pose in-car detection, but this type of approaches requires a large training dataset for a feasible accuracy. This requirement poses a difficulty, given the substantial time required to annotate such large amount of data. In the in-car scenario, this requirement risk increases even further, since a robust human body pose ground-truth system capable of working in it is needed but inexistent. Currently, the gold standard for human body pose capture is based on optical systems, requiring up to 39 visible markers for a plug-in gait model, which in this case are not feasible given the occlusions inside the car. Other solutions, such as inertial suits, also have limitations linked to magnetic sensitivity and global positioning drift. In this paper, a system for the generation of images for human body pose detection in an in-car environment is proposed. To this end, we propose to smartly combine inertial and optical systems to suppress their individual limitations: By combining the global positioning of 3 visible head markers provided by the optical system with the inertial suit's relative human body pose, we obtain an occlusion-ready, drift-free full-body global positioning system. This system is then spatially and temporally calibrated with a time-of-flight sensor, automatically obtaining in-car image data with (multi-person) pose annotations. Besides quantifying the inertial suit inherent sensitivity and accuracy, the feasibility of the overall system for human body pose capture in the in-car scenario was demonstrated. Our results quantify the errors associated with the inertial suit, pinpoint some sources of the system's uncertainty and propose how to minimize some of them. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of using system generated data (which was made publicly available), independently or mixed with two publicly available generic datasets (not in-car), to train 2 machine learning algorithms, demonstrating the improvement in their algorithmic accuracy for the in-car scenario.

AB Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) will become an essential part of every city in the near future. They should support various vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications that improve road safety or even enable autonomous driving. Recently, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) introduced a multi-access (mobile) edge computing concept as a promising solution to satisfy the V2X delay and computational requirements. Based on this concept, the tasks generated by V2X applications can be offloaded to servers at the edge of the radio access network (RAN). There is a need for a task offloading algorithm that minimizes the ITS operator expenses connected with the servers deployment and maintenance while satisfying the requirements of the V2X applications. Most of the existing papers in the literature do not pay much attention to queuing delays at servers. In this paper, the queuing delays are analyzed by considering a general-type task computational time distribution. A non-linear optimization problem is formulated to minimize the ITS operator expenses subject to delays and computational resources constraints. The flexibility is also improved by considering that a delay constraint is satisfied with a given probability. To solve this problem, a method for linearization of the problem is proposed, and consequently, an algorithm based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) is designed. A heuristic algorithm called Cost-effective Heuristic Algorithm for Task offloading (CHAT) is also introduced that provides close to optimal results and has much lower computational complexity than the ILP algorithm. The efficiency of the CHAT algorithm is studied in several scenarios in terms of the computational time, delays, and the total server energy consumption as the cost function. The results show that the CHAT algorithm satisfies the requirements of the V2X applications in all the considered scenarios and reduces the ITS operator expenses over twice compared with other algorithms proposed in the literature.

AB This study experimentally investigates the effectiveness of various PV cleaning techniques for potential retrofitting into unmanned aerial vehicles, drones, for large-scale solar power plant cleaning operations in desert climates. The ultimate objective of this study is to improve the efficiency, reduce the cost, time and environmental impact of cleaning techniques by integrating them with autonomous drone cleaning to ensure cost-effectiveness and competitiveness of Solar PV installations. This study considers the following factors: (i) cleaning effectiveness (power output change in W and %), (ii) frequency of cleaning (daily, weekly, and monthly), (iii) overall cost of cleaning (USD/m(2)), (iv) adaptability to drone, (v) energy consumption, and (vi) weight. The cleaning techniques tested for their effectiveness and overall cost are (1) cloth wipers, (2) brushes, (3) vacuum cleaners, and (4) some combinations. Cleaning frequency is varied from 1-day to 1-month intervals to find the optimal cleaning period. The results of this study show that there is a significant reduction in the PV efficiency, and hence an increase in the cost of produced electricity, for monthly cleaning periods regardless of cleaning technique in desert climate conditions. The microfiber based-cloth wiper is found to be the optimum method from both cost and performance point of view. Microfiber based-cloth wiper achieved on average 7.7% and 3.1% performance improvement (compared to control panel) for weekly cleaning frequency in winter and summer seasons, respectively. The assessment of drone retrofitting was also conducted, which resulted that the brush and microfiber based-cloth wiper with their low weight, small size, and ease of use are best-suited options for drone-based solar panel cleaning. The evaluation factors for microfiber based-cloth wiper are found to be (i) 3.1% for cleaning effectiveness in summer, (ii) 1 week for frequency of cleaning, (iii) 0.41 USD/m(2) for overall cost of cleaning, (iv) 9.5 (out of 10) for adaptability to drone, (v) 10 (out of 10) for energy consumption and (vi) 9 (out of 10) for weight.

AB Advances in acoustic imaging of submarine canyons and channels have provided accurate renderings of sea-floor geomorphology. Still, a fundamental understanding of channel inception, evolution, sediment transport and the nature of the currents traversing these channels remains elusive. Herein, Autonomous Underwater Vehicle technology developed by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute provides high-resolution perspectives of the geomorphology and shallow stratigraphy of the San Mateo canyon-channel system, which is located on a tectonically active slope offshore of southern California. The channel comprises a series of crescent-shaped bedforms in its thalweg. Numerical modelling is combined with interpretations of sea-floor and shallow subsurface stratigraphic imagery to demonstrate that these bedforms are likely to be cyclic steps. Submarine cyclic steps compose a morphodynamic feature characterized by a cyclic series of long-wave, upstream-migrating bedforms. The bedforms are cyclic steps if each bedform in the series is bounded by a hydraulic jump in an overriding turbidity current, which is Froude-supercritical over the lee side of the bedform and Froude-subcritical over the stoss side. Numerical modelling and seismic-reflection imagery support an interpretation of weakly asymmetrical to near-symmetrical aggradation of predominantly fine-grained net-depositional cyclic steps. The dominant mode of San Mateo channel maintenance during the Holocene is interpreted to be thalweg reworking into aggrading cyclic steps by dilute turbidity currents. Numerical modelling also suggests that an incipient, proto-San Mateo channel comprises a series of relatively coarse-grained net-erosional cyclic steps, which nucleated out of sea-floor perturbations across the tectonically active lower slope. Thus, the interaction between turbidity-current processes and sea-floor perturbations appears to be fundamentally important to channel initiation, particularly in high-gradient systems. Offshore of southern California, and in analogous deep-water basins, channel inception, filling and maintenance are hypothesized to be strongly linked to the development of morphodynamic instability manifested as cyclic steps.

ID REGOLITH
AB ExoMars is the European Space Agency (ESA) mission to Mars planned for launch in 2018, focusing on exobiology with the primary objective of searching for any traces of extant or extinct carbon-based micro-organisms. The on-surface mission is performed by a near-autonomous mobile robotic vehicle (also referred to as the rover) with a mission design life of 180 sols (Patel et al., 2010). In order to obtain useful data on the tractive performance of the ExoMars rover before flight, it is necessary to perform mobility tests on representative soil simulant materials producing a Martian terrain analogue under terrestrial laboratory conditions. Three individual types of regolith shown to be found extensively on the Martian surface were identified for replication using commercially available terrestrial materials, sourced from UK sites in order to ensure easy supply and reduce lead times for delivery. These materials (also referred to as the Engineering Soil (ES-x) simulants) are: a fine dust analogue (ES-1); a fine aeolian sand analogue (ES-2); and a coarse sand analogue (ES-3). Following a detailed analysis, three fine sand regolith types were identified from commercially available products. Each material was used in its off-the-shelf state, except for ES-2, where further processing methods were used to reduce the particle size range. These materials were tested to determine their physical characteristics, including the particle size distribution, particle density, particle shape (including angularity/sphericity) and moisture content. The results are analysed to allow comparative analysis with existing soil simulants and the published results regarding in situ analysis of Martian soil on previous NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) missions. The findings have shown that in some cases material properties vary significantly from the specifications provided by material suppliers. This has confirmed the need for laboratory testing to determine the actual parameters to prove that standard geotechnical processes are indeed suitable. The outcomes have allowed the confirmation of each simulant material as suitable for replicating their respective regolith types. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Digitalisation and the accompanying transformation processes, involving data, technology and people, are part of children's life and will shape their future. Competences, such as digital skills, as well as creativity, communication, collaboration, critical thinking and problem solving are crucial to these transformation processes. In early childhood, these competences are essentially acquired through play, especially pretend play. The project 'we play the future' draws on the potential of pretend play to enable young children to be actively engaged in imagining themselves shaping digital transformation in the roles of inventors, developers and users. Drawing on an analysis of fields currently undergoing digital transformation, eight inputs for pretend play were developed to areas of digital transformation (eg, robotics, autonomous vehicles and Internet of things). Fifteen kindergarten teachers implemented the pretend play on digital transformation in their kindergarten after taking a half-day introductory professional development course. The children's play was filmed and analysed using qualitative multimodal interaction analysis in order to examine the ways in which the pretend play encourages the exploration of digital transformation amongst the children. The results reveal the potential of pretend play for children to explore digital transformation and to acquire the digital competences needed in the future.
   Practitioner notes
   What is already known about this topic?
   Children integrate imaginative digital technology in their play.
   Guided pretend play is important for children's learning in kindergarten.
   What this paper adds
   Ideas for pretend play in kindergarten to enable children developing an understanding of digital transformation in a playful way
   The paper presents findings from video analysis which indicate that children are using competences needed for the digital future during pretend play
   Implications for practice
   Digital education should not just be focused on using and programming digital devices but include pretend play to explore digital transformation; through the inputs for pretend play suggested in the project, the kindergarten teachers support the children developing an understanding of digital technology.
   The inputs for pretend play enable children to develop competences such as technical and digital skills, as well as creativity, communication, collaboration, critical thinking and problem solving.

AB Intensifying pressure on global aquatic resources and services due to population growth and climate change is inspiring new surveying technologies to provide science-based information in support of management and policy strategies. One area of rapid development is hyperspectral remote sensing: imaging across the full spectrum of visible and infrared light. Hyperspectral imagery contains more environmentally meaningful information than panchromatic or multispectral imagery and is poised to provide new applications relevant to society, including assessments of aquatic biodiversity, habitats, water quality, and natural and anthropogenic hazards. To aid in these advances, we provide resources relevant to hyperspectral remote sensing in terms of providing the latest reviews, databases, and software available for practitioners in the field. We highlight recent advances in sensor design, modes of deployment, and image analysis techniques that are becoming more widely available to environmental researchers and resource managers alike. Systems recently deployed on space- and airborne platforms are presented, as well as future missions and advances in unoccupied aerial systems (UAS) and autonomous in-water survey methods. These systems will greatly enhance the ability to collect interdisciplinary observations on-demand and in previously inaccessible environments. Looking forward, advances in sensor miniaturization are discussed alongside the incorporation of citizen science, moving toward open and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data. Advances in machine learning and cloud computing allow for exploitation of the full electromagnetic spectrum, and better bridging across the larger scientific community that also includes biogeochemical modelers and climate scientists. These advances will place sophisticated remote sensing capabilities into the hands of individual users and provide on-demand imagery tailored to research and management requirements, as well as provide critical input to marine and climate forecasting systems. The next decade of hyperspectral aquatic remote sensing is on the cusp of revolutionizing the way we assess and monitor aquatic environments and detect changes relevant to global communities.

AB The Internet-of-Things (IoT) are used everywhere in our daily lives. IoT applications provide us with many useful functionalities such as preventing fires, detecting and tracking objects, controlling and reporting the changes in/outside the environments, and capturing images/videos in our homes, roads, and offices. For example, the images data gathered through the smart sensors of autonomous vehicles can serve in various applications such as traffic monitoring, prediction of road conditions, and classification of objects. Image classification with deep neural networks (DNNs) on the cloud is such a machine learning task and has great market potentials for IoT applications. Nevertheless, the deployment of these "smart" IoT devices and applications can raise the risks of security issues. It still suffers from the challenges of relieving IoT devices from excessive computation burdens, such as data encryption, feature extraction, and image classification. In this paper, we propose and implement an indistinguishability-chosen plaintext attack secure image classification framework with DNN for IoT Applications. The framework performs a secure image classification on the cloud without the IoT device's constant interaction. We propose and implement a real number computation mechanism and a divide-and-conquer mechanism for the secure evaluation of linear functions in DNNs, as well as a set of unified ideal protocols for the evaluation of non-linear functions in DNNs. The information about the image contents, the private DNNs model parameters and the intermediate results is strictly concealed by the conjunctive use of the lattice-based homomorphic scheme and 2-PC secure computation techniques. A pre-trained deep convolutional neural network model, i.e., Visual Geometry Group (VGG-16), is used to extract the deep features of an image. The comprehensive experimental results show that our framework is efficient and accurate. In addition, we evaluate the security of our framework by performing the white-box membership inference attack which is believed to be the most powerful attack on DNNs models. The failure of the attack indicates that our framework is practical secure.

AB High-resolution bathymetric mapping using an autonomous underwater vehicle and a survey vessel was conducted at Daisan-Miyako Knoll in the southern Ryukyu Arc. This paper presents for the first time the detailed volcanic morphology of a submarine edifice that previously was poorly explored, and discusses its formation process and relation to arc volcanism and tectonics. Bathymetry shows morphological evidence that Daisan-Miyako Knoll is a stratovolcano with three caldron-like depressions (> 1 km in diameter), a central cone, and multiple lava flows at the summit. The main edifice is conical with a basal diameter of 8-10 km and relief of 1000-1100 m, with a summit depth of 779 m. The central cone that stands inside the depressions has a circular crater. Numerous blocks up to 10 m wide are distributed around the crater, indicating a previous explosive eruption. Lava flows erupted from the central cone have a maximum thickness of 46 m at the flow margins and a maximum flow length of 1.9 km. The total flow area is 1.5 km(2) and the estimated volume is 0.03 km(3). The relatively thick lava flows (up to 46 m) with steep-sided margins (30-40 degrees) and curtain-folded surface textures suggest that silicic magmas erupted, and their fresh appearance indicates that lava-flow eruptions (the most recent volcanic activity) occurred during the Quaternary. The volcanic features at Daisan-Miyako Knoll are aligned mainly in the NW SE direction, suggesting that volcanism here may be controlled primarily by arc parallel extension. No volcanic edifices have been confirmed on the trench side of Daisan-Miyako Knoll, therefore this edifice defines the location of the arc volcanic front in this region. From the larger rhyolitic edifices (> 10 km wide) around Daisan-Miyako Knoll along the front, it is inferred that silicic arc volcanism is extending from the central to southern submarine Ryukyu Arc.

AB Seafloor spreading at slow and ultraslow rates is often taken up by extension on large-offset faults called detachments, which exhume lower crustal and mantle rocks, and in some cases make up domed oceanic core complexes. The exposed footwall may reveal a characteristic pattern of spreading-parallel corrugations, the largest of which are clearly visible in multibeam bathymetric data, and whose nature and origin have been the subject of controversy. In order to tackle this debate, we use available near bottom bathymetric surveys recently acquired with autonomous deep-sea vehicles over five corrugated detachments along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. With a spatial resolution of 2 m, these data allow us to compare the geometry of corrugations on oceanic detachments that are characterized by differing fault zone lithologies, and accommodate varying amounts of slip. The fault surfaces host corrugations with wavelengths of 10-250 m, while individual corrugations are finite in length, typically 100-500 m. Power spectra of profiles calculated across the corrugated fault surfaces reveal a common level of roughness, and indicate that the fault surfaces are not fractal. Since systematic variation in roughness with fault offset is not evident, we propose that portions of the exposed footwalls analyzed here record constant brittle strain. We assess three competing hypotheses for corrugation formation and find that the continuous casting and varying depth to brittle-ductile transition models cannot explain the observed corrugation geometry nor available geological observations. We suggest a model involving brittle strain localization on a network of linked fractures within a zone of finite thickness is a better explanation for the observations. This model explains corrugations on oceanic detachment faults exposed at the seafloor and on normal faults in the continents, and is consistent with recently imaged corrugations on a subduction zone megathrust. Hence fracture linkage and coalescence may give rise to corrugated fault zones, regardless of earlier deformation history and tectonic setting. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Inverse reinforcement learning control for building energy management
SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
LA English
DT Article
DE Inverse reinforcement learning; Building controls; Artificial
   intelligence; Practical reinforcement learning
AB Reinforcement learning (RL) based control is widely considered a promising approach in building automation and control as it has demonstrated the potential to deal with complex objectives in adjacent domains like robotics, autonomous vehicles, gaming applications, and advertisement recommendations. When applied to any environment, model-free RL learns to improve its control performance over time without requiring a control model, by receiving and then analyzing feedback from the building environ-ment after each control action. Operational objectives are becoming increasingly complex through the simultaneous consideration of thermal comfort, carbon emissions, grid services, and indoor air quality. In this context, conventional rule-based control approaches are proving sub-optimal, mostly heuristic, and inadequate. The model-free and self learning nature of RL appears promising and attractive as it may address the scalability issues associated with advanced control approaches. However, it suffers from long training times and unstable control behavior during the early stages of its learning process, which makes it unsuitable to be applied directly to buildings. This paper addresses these issues using an inverse reinforcement learning approach (IRL), a technique utilized to learn the objective of a controller agent which is considered an expert in its respective domain. Here, we consider a rule-based control as the expert demonstrator. IRL is different from a direct imitation (i.e., direct mapping of states to actions) of control actions as it tries to find the underlying intent of an expert's policy, providing the controller with a better-generalized policy for unseen states or environments with slightly different dynamics. This approach propels the RL controller's policy to levels similar to or better than that of a rule-based pol-icy before it starts learning by interacting with the building. This makes RL for building energy manage-ment applications more practical as it prevents the erratic and exploratory behavior in the initial training period, simultaneously speeding up the learning process when compared to applying an untrained RL agent directly to a building environment.CO 2023 Elsevier B.V.

DE Pruning; free-space detection; lightweight network; multi-modal
   learning; FPGA
AB For autonomous vehicles, free-space detection is an essential part of visual perception. With the development of multi-modal convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in recent years, the performance of driving scene semantic segmentation algorithms has been dramatically improved. Therefore most free-space detection algorithms are developed based on multiple sensors. However, multi-modal CNNs have high data throughput and contain a large number of computationally intensive convolution calculations, limiting their feasibility for real-time applications. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) provide a unique combination of flexibility, performance, and low power for these problems to accommodate multi-modal data and the computational acceleration of different compression algorithms. Network lightweight methods offer great assurance for facilitating the deployment of CNNs on such resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we propose a network lightweight method for a multi-modal free-space detection algorithm. We first propose an FPGA-friendly multi-modal free-space detection lightweight network. It comprises operators that FPGA prefers and achieves a 95.54% MaxF score on the test set of KITTI-Road free-space detection tasks and 81 ms runtime when running on 700 W GPU devices. Then we present a pruning approach for this network to reduce the number of parameters in case the complete model exceeds the FPGA chip memory. The pruning is in two parts. For the feature extractors, we propose a data-dependent filter pruner according to the principle that the low-rank feature map contains less information. To not compromise the integrity of the multi-modal information, the pruner is independent for each modality. For the segmentation decoder, we apply a channel pruning approach to remove redundant parameters. Finally, we implement our designs on an FPGA board using 8-bit quantisation, and the accelerator achieves outstanding performance. A real-time application of scene segmentation on KITTI-Road is used to evaluate our algorithm, and the model achieves a 94.39% MaxF score and minimum 14 ms runtime on 20W FPGA devices.

AB This study presents the hydrodynamic characteristics around a torpedo-like geometry under the free-surface effect at different angles of attack using preliminary dye visualization and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The optimized torpedo-like geometry is placed at submersion ratios between 0.5 <= h/D <= 3.50 where h is the distance to the free-surface from its centerline and D is the diameter. Throughout the experiments, angles of attack were taken as 0 degrees <=alpha <= 12 degrees for two Reynolds numbers, Re & nbsp;=& nbsp;2.0 & nbsp;x & nbsp;10(4)& nbsp;and 4.0 & nbsp;x & nbsp;10(4). The PIV method provided instantaneous vorticity and time-averaged velocity components, vorticity, streamline topology, fluctuating velocity components, Reynolds stress correlation, and the turbulent kinetic energy. This study focused on the stern section and the wake structures at & nbsp;h/D=1.0 & nbsp;. It is demonstrated that a jet-like flow region occurred between the model and the free-surface for all angles of attack at small submersion ratios of 0.5 <= h/D <= 1.0 while it is observed at & nbsp;h/D=1.5 & nbsp;for & nbsp;alpha=8 degrees, a jet-like flow region occurred between the model and the free-surface. The impact of the jet-like flow was more noticeable for & nbsp;alpha=4 degrees & nbsp;and 8 degrees with & nbsp;velocity fluctuations & nbsp;in lower magnitudes. The nose section partially pierced the free-surface for h/D & nbsp;=& nbsp;0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 in the range of 4 degrees <=alpha <= 12 degrees and it prevented the wake region from connecting with the free-surface by directing the separated flow region toward the stern section. Pointwise variations of the turbulence data extracted from vertical lines within the wake region for all cases revealed that the effect of the free-surface on the turbulence statistics was negligible beyond h/D=2.0.

AB The evolution of submarine canyons is primarily controlled by turbidity currents, which erode and fill them over time; however, many other hydrodynamic currents operate within canyons. Bottom currents from these other hydrodynamic processes, including internal tides, can be dominant processes, but their deposits are seldom recognized in sediment cores or the rock record. This study combines autonomous underwater vehicle swath bathymetry imagery and sub-bottom profiles, high-resolution sediment core analyses (X-ray imagery and thin sections), and previously collected seabed video and flow measurements within Logan Canyon head (eastern Canada) to provide a detailed, modern record of facies associated with hydrodynamic processes in a canyon head. These results suggest that bottom currents are responsible for maintaining gullies on canyon sidewalls and an axial channel on the canyon floor. Thin sections of sediment cores reveal that muddy sand in the canyon head consists of mud aggregates and silt and fine-grained sand, both behaving similarly in terms of flow dynamics. Three facies are present at macro-scale and micro-scale: laminated, partially laminated and bioturbated sandy mud. Sedimentary structures include rhythmic sand and mud aggregate couplets, planar to wavy laminations, current ripple cross-laminations and fining-upward successions, which are attributed to bottom currents induced by internal tides. Bioturbated facies, characterized by discrete biogenic structures and cross-cutting relationships, predominate and overprint a mottled background. A mottled bioturbation fabric also alternates with or locally disrupts layering within the partially laminated facies. Internal tide currents, capable of bedload transport and forming ripples, were measured during a monitoring period in the canyon head, followed by rapid re-establishment of benthos and associated biogenic structures, supporting the core interpretations. Preservation of sedimentary facies associated with these internal tides occurs when the sedimentation rate outpaces the rate of bioturbation, likely during stormier conditions on the shelf. These results represent observations of sedimentary facies associated with modern bottom currents and internal tides, and can be used to interpret similar occurrences within the rock record.

AB A High-Definition (HD) map is an essential component not only for autonomous vehicles but also for surveyors in favor of city management. Moreover, the HD map must be up-to-date by reflecting environmental changes continuously. The development of LiDAR Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) techniques has pro-vided an effective way to collect precise point clouds for the construction of HD maps, while traditional methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive on account of the complex street scene. Furthermore, life-long 3D mapping is quite necessary and challenging nowadays. In this paper, we introduce a novel change-aware 3D online mapping framework CAOM,1 using point clouds collected by Multi-Beam LiDAR (MBL) and Push-Broom LiDAR (PBL) for rapid city map update and change detection. Concerning the prior map with higher precision, heterogenous fusion is performed to rectify the SLAM drift, based on the View-Traced Clouds (ViTC) derived according to their view in common. Meanwhile, corresponding virtual range images are integrated with distance images to detect the 3D changes between the current map and the historical reference map offline. The detection results are later fused in a probabilistic way along with the homogeneous fusion process where a resilient graph consisting of diverse factors is established to maintain the local and global consistency of the final point cloud map. Compared with 3D-CSTM, the real-world experiments have shown an average 0.5 m and max 1.5 m improvement in the ATE (Absolute Translation Error) of the trajectory generated by our system. Quantitative measurements on the individual point accuracy are also conducted to verify the performance of 3D mapping with up to 16% improvement in comparison with respect to the 3D-CSTM method. The effects of the disparity detection and probabilistic fusion can be revealed from the small objects distinguished in the point cloud map as well as > 95% overall accuracy.

AB The formation of hybrid underwater gliders has advantages in sustained ocean observation with high resolution and more adaptation for complicated ocean tasks. However, the current work mostly focused on the traditional gliders and AUVs. The research on control strategy and energy consumption minimization for the hybrid gliders is necessary both in methodology and experiment. A multi-layer coordinate control strategy is developed for the fleet of hybrid underwater gliders to control the gliders' motion and formation geometry with optimized energy consumption. The inner layer integrated in the onboard controller and the outer layer integrated in the ground control center or the deck controller are designed. A coordinate control model is proposed based on multibody theory through adoption of artificial potential fields. Considering the existence of ocean flow, a hybrid motion energy consumption model is constructed and an optimization method is designed to obtain the heading angle, net buoyancy, gliding angle and the rotate speed of screw propeller to minimize the motion energy with consideration of the ocean flow. The feasibility of the coordinate control system and motion optimization method has been verified both by simulation and sea trials. Simulation results show the regularity of energy consumption with the control variables. The fleet of three Petrel-II gliders developed by Tianjin University is deployed in the South China Sea. The trajectory error of each glider is less than 2.5 km, the formation shape error between each glider is less than 2 km, and the difference between actual energy consumption and the simulated energy consumption is less than 24% actual energy. The results of simulation and the sea trial prove the feasibility of the proposed coordinate control strategy and energy optimization method. In conclusion, a coordinate control system and a motion optimization method is studied, which can be used for reference in theoretical research and practical fleet operation for both the traditional gliders and hybrid gliders.

AB High-quality forward-looking sonar images are the basic guarantee for underwater object detection and classification of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). However, the sonar image has been suffering from two main problem with complex and changeable underwater environment: high speckle noises and the lack of high frequency information. In this paper, a two-stage sonar image enhancement algorithm based on convolutional autoencoder is proposed to solve the above two problems to allow low-frequency sonar images to obtain resolutions approximate to high-frequency sonar images. For the high speckle noise, we proposed a convolutional denoising autoencoder based speckle reduction method for low-frequency sonar image to avoid noise enhanced as the image enhancement process. Skip connections and newly designed loss function is incorporated to better suppress noise with varying degrees. To solve the problem of insufficient high frequency information, a convolutional sparse autoencoder is further introduced to achieve image super resolution enhancement. In order to verify the effectiveness of the enhancement network proposed in this paper, we conducted extensive experimental analysis have been conducted from two aspects: image enhancement effect and underwater target detection effect. Specifically, underwater sonar images have been collected was conducted based on our self-owned AUV platform equipped with a dual frequency forward looking sonar in a water tank for network training. And three datasets are constructed for speckle reduction, high-frequency restoration, and underwater target detection. Through extensive experimental verification, our proposed enhancement method achieves high performance improvement on speckle reduction and high-frequency information restoration than the state-of-the-art image speckle reduction and image enhancement algorithms with a better PSNR, SSIM, and EPI. Finally, the YOLO V5 network model is used for underwater target detection and the experimental results show that combining image enhancement networks can effectively alleviate the problems of false and missed detections in the original network, which greatly improving the detection accuracy of the algorithm with a high detection speed. All the experiments have shown that the method proposed in this paper can effectively improve the underwater perception ability of sonar equipment.

AB The excavation of the ocean has led to the submersion of numerous autonomous vehicles and sensors. Hence, there is a growing need for multi-user underwater acoustic communication. On the other hand, due to the limited bandwidth of the underwater acoustic channel, downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is one of the fundamental pieces of technology for solving the problem of limited bandwidth, and it is expected to be beneficial for many modern wireless underwater acoustic applications. NOMA downlink underwater acoustic communication (UWA) is accomplished by broadcasting data symbols from a source station to several users, which uses superimposed coding with variable power levels to enable detection through successive interference cancellation (SIC) receivers. Nevertheless, comprehensive information of the channel condition and channel state information (CSI) are both essential for SIC receivers, but they can be difficult to obtain, particularly in an underwater environment. To address this critical issue, this research proposes downlink underwater acoustic communication using a deep neural network utilizing a 1D convolution neural network (CNN). Two cases are considered for the proposed system in the first case: in the first case, two users with different power levels and distances from the transmitter employ BPSK and QPSK modulations to support multi-user communication, while, in the second case, three users employ BPSK modulation. Users far from the base station receive the most power. The base station uses superimposed coding. The BELLHOP ray-tracing algorithm is utilized to generate the training dataset with user depth and range modifications. For training the model, a composite signal passes through the samples of the UWA channel and is fed to the model along with labels. The DNN receiver learns the characteristic of the UWA channel and does not depend on CSI. The testing CIR is used to evaluate the trained model. The results are compared to the traditional SIC receiver. The DNN-based DL NOMA underwater acoustic receiver outperformed the SIC receiver in terms of BER in simulation results for all the modulation orders.

AB We are witnessing a race to meet the ever-growing computation requirements of emerging AI applications to provide perception and control in autonomous vehicles - e.g., self-driving cars and UAVs. To remain competitive, vendors are packing more processing units (CPUs, programmable logic, GPUs, and hardware accelerators) into next-generation multiprocessor systems-on-a-chip (MPSoC). As a result, modern embedded platforms are achieving new heights in peak computational capacity. Unfortunately, however, the collateral and inevitable increase in complexity represents a major obstacle for the development of correct-by-design safety-critical real-time applications. Due to the ever-growing gap between fast-paced hardware evolution and comparatively slower evolution of real-time operating systems (RTOS), there is a need for real-time oriented full-platform management frameworks to complement traditional RTOS designs. In this work, we propose one such framework, namely the X-Stream framework, for the definition, synthesis, and analysis of real-time workloads targeting state-of-the-art accelerator-augmented embedded platforms. Our X-Stream framework is designed around two cardinal principles. First, computation and data movements are orchestrated to achieve predictability by design. For this purpose, iterative computation over large data chunks is divided into subsequent segments. These segments are then streamed leveraging the three-phase execution model (load, execute and unload). Second, the framework is workflow-centric: system designers can specify their workflow and the necessary code for workflow orchestration is automatically generated. In addition to automating the deployment of user-defined hardware-accelerated workloads, X-Stream supports the deployment of some computation segments on traditional CPUs. Finally, X-Stream allows the definition of real-time partitions. Each partition groups applications belonging to the same criticality level and that share the same set of hardware resources, with support for preemptive priority-driven scheduling. Conversely, freedom from interference for applications deployed in different partitions is guaranteed by design. We provide a full-system implementation that includes RTOS integration and showcase the proposed X -Stream framework on a Xilinx Ultrascale+ platform by focusing on a matrix-multiplication and addition kernel use-case.

AB The occurrence of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) across the 2600 km of Hawaiian archipelago, which include the remote atolls, banks, and seamounts of Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument (PMNM), remains poorly understood. Previous surveys for humpback whales beyond the main Hawaiian Islands have been scarce due to limited access and the challenging winter conditions typically found in PMNM when whales are present. To overcome these limitations, a combination of moored acoustic recorders and a Wave Glider autonomous surface vehicle were used to acoustically monitor eight locations and survey approximately 1500 km of the Hawaiian archipelago for the occurrence of humpback whale song during the 2019-2020 breeding season. Relative song prevalence was established using a machine learning tool and by quantifying the level of song chorusing. A generalized additive model framework was applied to understand the associations between habitat variables and humpback whale song occurrence, and sound propagation modeling was performed to examine whether acoustic propagation influenced observed patterns. Whale song was recorded at all monitored and surveyed locations across the archipelago, albeit in varying amounts. Among the locations monitored with moored recorders, the highest and most sustained seasonal chorusing levels were measured off Maui followed by French Frigate Shoals (Kanemilohai), Hawaii Island, Middle Bank, Oahu, Kauai, Gardner Pinnacles (Puhahonu) and Pearl and Hermes Reef (Holoikauaua), respectively. The Wave Glider mission to PMNM revealed that song prevalence was highest at Middle Bank and gradually decreased further to the northwest, reaching a minimum at Gardner Pinnacles (Puhahonu). However, song occurrence increased again at Raita Bank, remaining high between Raita Bank and the Northampton Seamounts. The results reveal that nearly the entire Hawaiian archipelago is exploited by humpback whales during the winter and early spring months. Moreover, song occurrence patterns suggest that there may be more structure in the distribution of whales in PMNM than previously known and raises questions about whether multiple subpopulations occur across the archipelago.

TI Enhancing Environmental Engagement with Natural Language Interfaces for
   In-Vehicle Navigation Systems
SO JOURNAL OF NAVIGATION

AB Four on-road studies were conducted in the Clifton area of Nottingham, UK, aiming to explore the relationships between driver workload and environmental engagement associated with 'active' and 'passive' navigation systems. In a between-subjects design, a total of 61 experienced drivers completed two experimental drives comprising the same three routes (with overlapping sections), staged one week apart. Drivers were provided with the navigational support of a commercially-available navigation device ('satnav'), an informed passenger (a stranger with expert route knowledge), a collaborative passenger (an individual with whom they had a close, personal relationship) or a novel interface employing a conversational natural language 'NAV-NLI' (Navigation Natural Language Interface). The NAV-NLI was created by curating linguistic intercourse extracted from the earlier conditions and delivering this using a 'Wizard-of-Oz' technique. This term describes a research experiment in which subjects interact with a computer system that they believe to be autonomous, but which is actually being operated or partially operated by an unseen human being. The different navigational methods were notable for their varying interactivity and the preponderance of environmental landmark information within route directions. Participants experienced the same guidance on each of the two drives to explore changes in reported and observed behaviour. Results show that participants who were more active in the navigation task (collaborative passenger or NAV-NLI) demonstrated enhanced environmental engagement (landmark recognition, route-learning and survey knowledge) allowing them to reconstruct the route more accurately post-drive, compared to drivers using more passive forms of navigational support (SatNav or informed passenger). Workload measures (the Tactile Detection Task (TDT) and the National Aeronautical and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX)) indicated no differences between conditions, although SatNav users and collaborative passenger drivers reported lower workload during their second drive. The research demonstrates clear benefits and potential for a navigation system employing two-way conversational language to deliver instructions. This could help support a long-term perspective in the development of spatial knowledge, enabling drivers to become less reliant on the technology and begin to re-establish associations between viewing an environmental feature and the related navigational manoeuvre.

AB With the rapid economic development of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the area's transport sector has witnessed significant growth, which in turn has led to a large increase in carbon dioxide emissions. As such, calculating of the carbon footprint of Xinjiang's transportation sector and probing the driving factors of carbon dioxide emissions are of great significance to the region's energy conservation and environmental protection. This paper provides an account of the growth in the carbon emissions of Xinjiang's transportation sector during the period from 1989 to 2012. We also analyze the transportation sector's trends and historical evolution. Combined with the STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology) model and ridge regression, this study further quantitatively analyzes the factors that influence the carbon emissions of Xinjiang's transportation sector. The results indicate the following: (1) the total carbon emissions and per capita carbon emissions of Xinjiang's transportation sector both continued to rise rapidly during this period; their average annual growth rates were 10.8% and 9.1%, respectively; (2) the carbon emissions of the transportation sector come mainly from the consumption of diesel and gasoline, which accounted for an average of 36.2% and 2.6% of carbon emissions, respectively; in addition, the overall carbon emission intensity of the transportation sector showed an "S"-pattern trend within the study period; (3) population density plays a dominant role in increasing carbon dioxide emissions. Population is then followed by per capita GDP and, finally, energy intensity. Cargo turnover has a more significant potential impact on and role in emission reduction than do private vehicles. This is because road freight is the primary form of transportation used across Xinjiang, and this form of transportation has low energy efficiency. These findings have important implications for future efforts to reduce the growth of transportation-based carbon dioxide emissions in Xinjiang and for any effort to construct low-carbon and sustainable environments.

AB Recent studies have proposed the use of a hot-air (Montgolfiere) balloon for possible exploration of Titan, Mars, and Venus. One of NASA's Outer Planet Flagship mission concepts is the Titan Saturn System Mission, which would be a joint NASA-ESA partnership that plans to employ a Montgolfiere along with a lake lander and an orbiter. This Montgolfiere would circle Titan, investigating how Titan and Saturn operate as a system and determining how far prebiotic chemistry has developed. This paper provides a new method to analyze global path planning with balloons on Titan. The main objective of this study is to determine whether the balloon could reach a particular location of interest from a given initial position at its insertion point in the atmosphere using the wind fields on Titan. This study is the first comprehensive analysis and quantitative assessment of balloon guidance in Titan that proactively uses wind for global path planning. The paper will investigate and characterize the guidance and path-planning performance of Montgolfiere balloons in Titan's atmosphere for lower atmosphere and surface exploration in the presence of variable wind fields using the Titan Weather Research and Forecasting (TitanWRF) model. The study focuses on determining the altitude profile that a balloon could follow, using variable wind fields, in order to reach its target most quickly. Our results show that a simple unpropelled Montgolfiere without horizontal actuation would be able to reach a broad array of science targets within the constraints of the wind field. The study also indicates that even a small amount of horizontal thrust allows the balloon to reach any area of interest on Titan, in a fraction of the time needed by the unpropelled balloon. The results show that using the Titan wind field allows a balloon to significantly extend its scientific reach and that a Montgolfiere (unpropelled or propelled) is a highly desirable architecture that can significantly enhance the scientific return of a future Titan mission.

AB Today's organizations have been embracing digital transformation to boost the quality of living within IoT-based smart-sustainable environments (e.g., healthcare, factories, vehicles, etc.). At the same time, augmenting the network infrastructure surface with billions of new devices accommodating myriad applications creates the need for network automation through different technologies, such as Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), and Big Data Analytics (BDA). However, to devise an end-to-end self-driving and autonomous network, the manual configuration of network parameters and devices should be limited or even vanished. The recently emerged Intent-based Networking (IBN) paradigm introduces an additional building block enabling the network to adapt its settings automatically according to high-level user demands (intents) while hiding low-level details of the underlying infrastructure (e.g., configurations in millions of network devices). This paper initiates a deeper discussion regarding service automation over a Hospital 4.0 environment, from translating user requests to service profiling (unstructured intent refinement), deployment, and assurance. First, we discuss the design challenges of joining an intent-based framework as a convenient plane to an SDN-based platform. Following, we focus on an intelligent intent refinement system based on the Named Entity Recognition (NER) approach, an application of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This IBN-NER system deploys an extensible network policy model and the pre-trained Google's BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) algorithm, fine-tuned with a Healthcare 4.0 dataset. The proposed intent refinement framework is evaluated via extensive simulations with an incremental number of heterogeneous intents. Our simulation results show promising performance with only one epoch for all dataset sizes and all policy model entities tested. For example, with 5000 intents, our system provides the highest accuracy with 86%; meanwhile, the well-known benchmarks in the NER problem, namely BiLSTM-CRF, BiLSTM, and LSTM, with ten epochs, provide 57%, 31%, and 26%, respectively.

AB Remote robotic interventions and maintenance tasks are frequently required in hazardous environments. Particularly, missions with a redundant mobile manipulator in the world's most complex machine, the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), are performed in a sensitive underground environment with radioactive or electromagnetic hazards, bringing further challenges in safety and reliability. The mission's success depends on the robot's hardware and software, and when the tasks become too unpredictable to execute autonomously, the operators need to make critical decisions. Still, in most current human-machine systems, the state of the human is neglected. In this context, a novel 3D Mixed Reality (MR) human-robot interface with the Operator Monitoring System (OMS) was developed to advance safety and task efficiency with improved spatial awareness, advanced manipulator control, and collision avoidance. However, new techniques could increase the system's sophistication and add to the operator's workload and stress. Therefore, for operational validation, the 3D MR interface had to be compared with an operational 2D interface, which has been used in hundreds of interventions. With the 3D MR interface, the execution of precise approach tasks was faster, with no increased workload or physiological response. The new 3D MR techniques improved the teleoperation quality and safety while maintaining similar effects on the operator. The OMS worked jointly with the interface and performed well with operators with varied teleoperation backgrounds facing a stressful real telerobotic scenario in the LHC. The paper contributes to the methodology for human-centred interface evaluation incorporating the user's physiological state: heart rate, respiration rate and skin electrodermal activity, and combines it with the NASA TLX assessment method, questionnaires, and task execution time. It provides novel approaches to operator state identification, the GUI-OMS software architecture, and the evaluation of the 3D MR techniques. The solutions can be practically applied in mission-critical applications, such as telesurgery, space robotics, uncrewed transport vehicles and semi-autonomous machinery.

Therefore, the adaptive design of VSL zones is required in traffic scenarios where congestion characteristics vary widely over space and time. To address this problem, we propose a novel distributed spatial-temporal multi-agent VSL (DWL-ST-VSL) approach capable of dynamically adjusting the length and position of VSL zones to complement the adjustment of speed limits in current VSL control systems. To model DWL-ST-VSL, distributed W-learning (DWL), a reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm for collaborative agent-based self-optimization toward multiple policies, is used. Each agent uses RL to learn local policies, thereby maximizing travel speed and eliminating congestion. In addition to local policies, through the concept of remote policies, agents learn how their actions affect their immediate neighbours and which policy or action is preferred in a given situation. To assess the impact of deploying additional agents in the control loop and the different cooperation levels on the control process, DWL-ST-VSL is evaluated in a four-agent configuration (DWL4-ST-VSL). This evaluation is done via SUMO microscopic simulations using collaborative agents controlling four segments upstream of the congestion in traffic scenarios with medium and high traffic loads. DWL also allows for heterogeneity in agents' policies; cooperating agents in DWL4-ST-VSL implement two speed limit sets with different granularity. DWL4-ST-VSL outperforms all baselines (W-learning-based VSL and simple proportional speed control), which use static VSL zones. Finally, our experiments yield insights into the new concept of VSL control. This may trigger further research on using advanced learning-based technology to design a new generation of adaptive traffic control systems to meet the requirements of operating in a nonstationary environment and at the leading edge of emerging connected and autonomous vehicles in general.

AB Macroalgae play a structuring role in benthic ecosystems, which makes it very important to monitor their cover rates and study their community structures and changes in time. Such studies are usually led by autonomous divers and often do not generate sufficient data to provide enough material for strategically-sound conservation plans. This paper describes the dataset generated in the framework of the evaluation of the potential of a complementary data acquisition method: annotating videos transects obtained using an underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV). The focus was on Cystoseira brachycarpa, together with the abundance of several other macroalgae species, which could be identified using the ROV images after validation through specimen identification. Furthermore, in order to allow future uses, such as monitoring the status of colonisation of the invasive algae Caulerpa cylindracea, the ROV was sent to some deeper transects on sedimentary habitats (40 m) below the Posidonia meadows lower limits. New information The project, while providing some interesting insights on using a ROV as a tool to study marine biodiversity, generated a dataset for the distribution of 19 macroalgae on both standardised and new transects in the Bay of Calvi (Katz et al. 2021). The observed species of macroalgae included: Acetabularia acetabulum, Amphiroa rigida, Caulerpa prolifera, Caulerpa cylindracea, Codium bursa, Colpomenia sinuosa, Corallinales (order), Cystoseira brachycarpa, Cystoseira crinita, Cystoseira spinosa, Cystoseira zosteroides, Dictyota (genus), Flabellia petiolata, Halopteris (genus), Halopteris scoparia, Jania (genus), Osmundaria volubilis, Padina pavonica and Peyssonnelia squamaria. The videos also showed that the invasive algae Caulerpa cylindracea has spread between 2016 and 2019 and that more focused studies should be held in the Bay to assess the actual reach and possible impacts of this invasion.Finally, our ROV video transects have also underlined the significant presence of particular benthic macroalgae communities over habitat zones described as "soft-bottom" on benthic habitat maps. Although the biomass per unit area of these communities is probably lower than for most coastal rocky bottoms, this widely-spread habitat type holds a contribution to primary production to be considered in coastal ecosystem models.

AB With growing consumer demand and expectations, companies are attempting to achieve cost-efficient and faster delivery operations. The integration of autonomous vehicles, such as drones, in the last-mile network design can curtail many operational challenges and provide a competitive advantage. This paper deals with the problem of delivering orders to a set of customer locations using multiple drones that operate in conjunction with a single truck. To take advantage of the drone fleet, the delivery tasks are parallelized by concurrently dispatching the drones from a truck parked at a focal point (ideal drone launch location) to the nearby customer locations. Hence, the key decisions to be optimized are the partitioning of delivery locations into small clusters, identifying a focal point per cluster, and routing the truck through all focal points such that the customer orders in each cluster are fulfilled either by a drone or truck. In contrast to prior studies that tackle this problem using multi-phase sequential procedures, this paper presents mathematical programming models to jointly optimize all the decisions involved. We also consider two polices for choosing a cluster focal point - (i) restricting it to one of the customer locations, and (ii) allowing it to be anywhere in the delivery area (i.e., a customer or non-customer location). Since the models considering unrestricted focal points are computationally expensive, an unsupervised machine learning-based heuristic algorithm is proposed to accelerate the solution time. Initially, we treat the problem as a single objective by independently minimizing either the total cost or delivery completion time. Subsequently, the two conflicting objectives are considered together for obtaining the set of best trade-off solutions. An extensive computational study is conducted to investigate the impacts of restricting the focal points, and the influence of adopting a joint optimization method instead of a sequential approach. Finally, several key insights are obtained to aid the logistics practitioners in decision making.

AB Use of DSV ALVIN (2006) and ROV JASON II (2007) provided access to never observed or sampled sites of fluid-gas expulsion from the little-studied middle and lower continental slope of the northern Gulf of Mexico (below water depths of 1000 m). Dives were focused on 15 locations selected by 3-D seismic surface attributes and shallow subsurface geologic analyses. The linkage between highly positive seafloor reflectivity and hard bottoms proved to be an efficient indicator of potential sites of interest. Through observation and sampling of reflective sites, starting in the mid-1980s, it has become apparent that most hard bottoms on the northern Gulfs continental slope are created by the precipitation of authigenic carbonates at hydrocarbon seep sites. Access to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement's extraordinary archive of slope-wide 3-D seismic data made efficient site selection possible. From thousands of sites that display the characteristics of fluid-gas expulsion, 15 were observed and sampled during the 2006 and 2007 cruises. Water depths in which these 15 sites were located ranged from similar to 2750 to similar to 970 m. All sites exhibited evidence of hydrocarbon seepage or more rapid venting. Chemosynthetic organisms, authigenic carbonates, barite, gas hydrates, highly anoxic surface sediments, brine pools, and hydrocarbon-laced brine flows were identified and sampled. High-resolution acoustic Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) data, including multibeam bathymetry, side-scan sonar swaths, and chirp sonar subbottom profiles, were collected at four locations (AC601, WR269, GC852, and AT340). Data sets from the 2006 and 2007 dives resulted in a greatly improved understanding of both cross-slope and along-slope variability in the characteristics of fluid-gas expulsion sites and associated habitats. Our studies confirmed the importance of fluid-gas expulsion processes for sustaining chemosynthetic communities and impacting seabed geology on the middle and lower continental slope of the northern Gulf of Mexico.

AB In this study, ship- and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-based multibeam data from the German ferromanganese-nodule (Mn-nodule) license area in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ; eastern Pacific) are linked to ground-truth data from optical imaging. Photographs obtained by an AUV enable semi-quantitative assessments of nodule coverage at a spatial resolution in the range of meters. Together with high-resolution AUV bathymetry, this revealed a correlation of small-scale terrain variations (< 5m horizontally, < 1m vertically) with nodule coverage. In the presented data set, increased nodule coverage could be correlated with slopes > 1.8 degrees and concave terrain. On a more regional scale, factors such as the geological setting (existence of horst and graben structures, sediment thickness, outcropping basement) and influence of bottom currents seem to play an essential role for the spatial variation of nodule coverage and the related hard substrate habitat.
   AUV imagery was also successfully employed to map the distribution of resettled sediment following a disturbance and sediment cloud generation during a sampling deployment of an epibenthic sledge. Data from before and after the "disturbance" allow a direct assessment of the impact. Automated image processing analyzed the nodule coverage at the seafloor, revealing nodule blanketing by resettling of suspended sediment within 16 h after the disturbance. The visually detectable impact was spatially limited to a maximum of 100m distance from the disturbance track, downstream of the bottom water current. A correlation with high-resolution AUV bathymetry reveals that the blanketing pattern varies in extent by tens of meters, strictly following the bathymetry, even in areas of only slightly undulating seafloor (< 1m vertical change).
   These results highlight the importance of detailed terrain knowledge when engaging in resource assessment studies for nodule abundance estimates and defining mineable areas. At the same time, it shows the importance of high-resolution mapping for detailed benthic habitat studies that show a heterogeneity at scales of 10 to 100 m. Terrain knowledge is also needed to determine the scale of the impact by seafloor sediment blanketing during mining operations.

AB This paper deals with the decentralized polynomial trajectory generation for the formation flight of a leader-follower network of quadrotors. The proposed decentralized trajectory planning method guarantees stability of the formation in missions with aggressive trajectories or low information exchange frequencies or data loss. Moreover, designed formation protocol ensures robustness of the formation against variations of the network communication topology. First, quadrotor translational dynamics is represented as a quadruple integrator by linearizing and differentiating its equations of translational motion. Then, a formation control law for a leader-follower network of the quadruple integrators is designed by implementing robustness properties of linear quadratic regulator design method and special characteristics of the network graph. Moreover, sufficient condition for the robustness of the formation against possible variations of the communication topology is addressed. According to the represented trajectory generation algorithm, once a follower receives information from its neighbors (e.g. coefficients of their intended polynomial trajectories), it plans a polynomial trajectory. To generate proper trajectories, integral of squared magnitude of error between the snap of the trajectory and its determined value by the formation control law over a finite horizon time should be minimized. The optimization problem can be formulated as a quadratic problem, which can be solved in real time. Furthermore, actuators limits can be imposed on the optimization problem as inequality constraints. As it is validated in the simulations, this predictive model of the trajectory generation provides stability of the formation in operations with aggressive trajectories or low information update frequencies or probability of data packets loss. Additionally, the quadrotors track the planned trajectories via implementing a hierarchical nonlinear trajectory tracking controller including a position controller and a geometrical attitude controller. Stability of the tracking error dynamics is proven by Lyapunov stability theorem. Expected capabilities of the formation control law, trajectory generation method and nonlinear trajectory tracking controller are examined in numerical simulations. In all of the simulations, an experimentally verified full model of a specific quadrotor taken from literatures is used.

AB A novel autonomous free-fall lander vehicle, with a capability down to 6000 m, was deployed off Cape Verde for studies on bioluminescence in the deep sea. The system was equipped with a high-sensitivity Intensified Silicon Intensified Target (ISIT) video camera, a programmable control-recording unit and an acoustic current meter with depth and temperature sensors. The ISIT lander was used in three modes: (1) free falling at 34 m min(-1), with the camera looking downwards at a mesh screen, recording impacts of luminescent organisms to obtain a vertical profile down to the abyssal sea floor, sampling at > 1001 s(-1); (2) rotating, with the lander on the sea floor and the camera orienting to the bottom current using a servo-controlled turntable, impacts of luminescent organisms carried by the bottom current onto a mesh screen mounted 0.5 m in front of the camera were recorded to estimate abundance in the benthic boundary layer; (3) baited, with the camera focused on a bait placed on the sea floor.
   Profiles recorded abundance of luminescent organisms as 26.7 m(-3) at 500-999 m depth, decreasing to 1.6 m(-3) at 2000-2499 m and 0.5 m(-3) between 2500 m and the sea floor at 4046 m, with no further detectable significant change with depth. Rotator measurements at a 0.5 m height above the sea floor gave a mean abundance of 0.47 m(-3) in the benthic boundary layer at 4046 m and of 2.04 m(-3) at 3200 m. Thirty five minutes after the bait was placed on the sea floor at 3200 m, bioluminescent fauna apparently arrived at the bait and produced luminescent displays at a rate of 2 min(-1). Moving, flashing light sources were observed and luminescent material was released into the bottom current. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The study aimed to assess the quality of spraying of ornamental conifer using a multi-rotor drone. We examined how the speed of drone movement and the propellers' spin speed can affect the deposition quality of the sprayed liquid in the crown of blue spruce (Picea pungens Engelm.). Due to the avoidance in the future of droplet drift by air movements, an air injector atomiser for liquid spraying was used, and a low altitude of 0.6 m of the drone flying above the tree was used in the study. The drone moved at two speeds: 0.57 m.s(-1) and 0.94 m.s(-1). The propellers' spin speeds were adjusted based on the drone's weight with the spray liquid tank filled and empty. The propellers' zero-spin rate was also included to compare the drone to a field sprayer. The tests were conducted in a laboratory setting. Volume and uniformity of liquid volume settled on the levels of samplers positioned on a tripod within the tree canopy were assessed. The samplers were placed in two zones of the tree: near the tree trunk and at a distance of 0.21 m from the trunk. Airstream speed generated by drone propellers was also evaluated inside the tree. The findings indicated that the rotations of propellers and air speed significantly influenced the quality of liquid deposition on samplers located away from the trunk. The results also showed that using a drone instead of a field sprayer could benefit the quality of the spray application. The weight of the multi-rotor drone, determined by the spray liquid tank's filling level, can significantly impact the quality of spray deposition in the tree. Based on the investigations, it can be recommended that low-altitude spraying drones be adopted for studies and future strategies in precision agriculture using autonomous inspection-spraying drones.

TI External Extrinsic Calibration of Multi-Modal Imaging Sensors: A Review

AB With the rapid development of autonomous driving, robotics, and intelligent transportation, multi-sensor-based environment sensing technology for intelligent vehicles has become a popular research direction. In order to better fuse the data acquired by multi-sensors, accurate external parameter calibration becomes one of the critical issues. According to the method of external parameter calibration, this paper first introduces the offline calibration technology based on target and targetless methods. However, once these two methods change the relative position between the camera and the LiDAR, it can only be returned to the field to re-calibrate. The computational complexity is high, which makes it necessary to use the online calibration directly. Hence, this paper follows up with the introduction of online calibration technology based on deep learning. Unlike previous methods that need to extract features from calibration boards or environments, various types of networks can directly learn the mapping relationship between images and point clouds, From the calibration results, the average error of translation and rotation of traditional methods can reach 0.34cm and 0.45(degrees), the average error of using deep learning networks such as LCCNet, which is the most widely used in existing networks and has good calibration effect, can reach 0.297cm and 0.017(degrees). Compared with the traditional method, the accuracy of online calibration technology is respectively improved by 12.6% and 96.2%, which shows the results of online calibration technology are better than the traditional offline method, and there are some recently proposed methods incorporate an attention mechanism and use an optimization algorithm instead of a loss function to refine the outer parameters. From the review, learning the relative relationships between sensors through neural networks works best, and the process is relatively free of human intervention. Contrary to the existing reviews, this paper provides a general structure of calibration methods universally used in various environments and compares various methods based on this general structure.

TI Multiple Traffic Target Tracking with Spatial-Temporal Affinity Network
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID MULTIOBJECT TRACKING; MULTITARGET
AB Traffic target tracking is a core task in intelligent transportation system because it is useful for scene understanding and vehicle autonomous driving. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA) multiple object tracking (MOT) methods adopt a two-step procedure: object detection followed by data association. The object detection has made great progress with the development of deep learning. However, the data association still heavily depends on hand crafted constraints, such as appearance, shape, and motion, which need to be elaborately trained for a special object. In this study, a spatial-temporal encoder-decoder affinity network is proposed for multiple traffic targets tracking, aiming to utilize the power of deep learning to learn a robust spatial-temporal affinity feature of the detections and tracklets for data association. The proposed spatial-temporal affinity network contains a two-stage transformer encoder module to encode the features of the detections and the tracked targets at the image level and the tracklet level, aiming to capture the spatial correlation and temporal history information. Then, a spatial transformer decoder module is designed to compute the association affinity, where the results from the two-stage transformer encoder module are fed back to fully capture and encode the spatial and temporal information from the detections and the tracklets of the tracked targets. Thus, efficient affinity computation can be applied to perform data association in online tracking. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, three popular multiple traffic target tracking datasets, KITTI, UA-DETRAC, and VisDrone, are used for evaluation. On the KITTI dataset, the proposed method is compared with 15 SOTA methods and achieves 86.9% multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) and 85.71% multiple object tracking precision (MOTP). On the UA-DETRAC dataset, 12 SOTA methods are used to compare with the proposed method, and the proposed method achieves 20.82% MOTA and 35.65% MOTP, respectively. On the VisDrone dataset, the proposed method is compared with 10 SOTA trackers and achieves 40.5% MOTA and 74.1% MOTP, respectively. All those experimental results show that the proposed method is competitive to the state-of-the-art methods by obtaining superior tracking performance.

AB A large-scale obliquely inclined bedding rockslide, activated by a heavy rainstorm, occurred on July 8, 2020, at 7:05 (UTC + 8) in Shiban Village, Songtao Miao Autonomous County, Guizhou Province, China. The loss of life in this event was greatly reduced owing to the local warning system for rainstorm-induced geohazards. To understand the failure characteristics, triggering factors, the genetic mechanism of the landslide, the geomorphological features, geological characteristics, hydrological conditions, and rainfall characteristics were systematically studied by a synthetic approach including field investigations, satellite imagery, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography, laboratory tests, and rainfall data statistics. The results indicated that the interface between the soft and hard rock, the well-developed joints, and the free face in front of the slope constituted the boundaries of this landslide. The concave topography at the back and southern edge of the landslide, the bare ground, and the cataclastic structure of the rock mass provided favorable conditions for the collection or infiltration of rainwater. The concentrated rainstorm was the direct trigger for the landslide, which led to a rapid inflow and retention of rainfall in the landslide through favorable landform and geological conditions. The groundwater recharge that cannot be drained in time caused the mechanical deterioration of rock mass and induced a rapid increase in pore water pressure in the landslide. Moreover, the water level of the Ganlong River at the toe of the slope also rose rapidly, and the uplift pressure in front of the slope increased accordingly. Under the combined action of these adverse factors, the overall anti-sliding force of the slope was less than the sliding force, finally resulting in the landslide. Remarkably, the local warning system for rainstorm-induced geohazards successfully forecasted the landslide, but the shortcoming is that the forecast time in advance is short. Nevertheless, the prediction has significantly reduced human casualties and provided valuable experience for the prediction of this type of landslide.

AB Unlike subaerial volcanic activity, deep submarine eruptions are difficult to detect, observe andmonitor. The objective of this paper is to describe a large and complex volcanic region, named the Horseshoe area, recently discovered at similar to 1500mbelow sea level on the eastern upper submarine slope of Mayotte Island. The area is crucial because, since 2018, it has experienced an exceptionally deep seismic activity associated with the ongoing submarine eruption that formed a new volcanic edifice, Fani Maore, about 40 km to the east. We present the results of a multiscale study, based on highresolution bathymetry and in-situ seafloor observations carried out with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and deep-towed camera systems. In-situ imagery provides ground-truth for the geological interpretation of seafloor textures mapped with the bathymetry. The combination of both datasets allows us to discuss the nature of the volcanic structures and to propose a relative chronology of previous eruptive events in the Horseshoe area. Based on our analyses, we propose the following chronology: (a) the emplacement of a large explosive volcanic cone, theHorseshoe edifice, (b) the later collapse of this edifice that resulted in the formation of an elongated, 2 km wide horseshoe-shaped depression, crosscutting older hummocky lava flows, (c) the development of an E-W eruptive fissure associated with numerous explosive craters, east of the Horseshoe edifice, and (d) late volcanism emanating from the rim of the horseshoe-shaped depression that fed elongated thin lava flows both towards and away from the depression. While all volcanic features mapped at the Horseshoe area were emplaced prior to the 2018 eruption, our study shows that this region has still been volcanically active in the recent past. Our results thus document a complex geological history at small spatial scales involved in the construction of major submarine edifices, and that are controlled by volcano-tectonic processes at larger scales.

AB Road features extraction is essential for autonomous driving vehicles and road maintenance. Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) systems have proven their capability for dense and accurate LiDAR point cloud data acquisition of road features. Usually, MLS data are received in the format of XYZ coordinates and sometimes with intensity values. Thus, the first step in MLS data processing is point classification, which mainly relays on the geometric distribution of surrounding points. However, processing such huge data is costly and time-consuming. Therefore, in this research, different neighborhood selection methods, including k nearest neighbors, spherical and cylindrical methods are evaluated to reveal the suitable method for MLS data classification. In addition, a data sub-sampling method based on minimum point spacing is applied in order to reduce the processing time. A set of point features, including covariance, moment and height was first extracted based on the three neighborhood selection methods. Random forest classifier was then used to classify a part of the benchmark dataset of Paris-Lille-3D, which belongs to NPM3D Benchmark suite research project. The dataset is divided into three main parts; Lille 1, Lille 2 and Paris. Lille 1 and Lille 2 were used in this research with about 1.5 km longitudinal road and about 98.1 million total number of points. Six scenarios were evaluated; three for the full dataset and three for the sub-sampled dataset using the aforementioned neighborhood selection methods. The results showed that the cylindrical neighborhood selection method achieved the highest classification accuracy of 92.39% and 90.26% for the full and sub-sampled datasets, respectively. The data sub-sampling has showed a good performance, whereas the dataset was reduced by about half and processing time was reduced by almost half with close classification accuracy using the cylindrical neighborhood selection method.(c) 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

AB The goal of this paper is to develop a modeling framework that captures the inter-decision dynamics between mobility service providers (MSPs) and travelers that can be used to optimize and analyze policies/regulations related to MSPs. To meet this goal, the paper proposes a tri-level mathematical programming model with a public-sector decision maker (i.e. a policymaker/regulator) at the highest level, the MSP in the middle level, and travelers at the lowest level. The public-sector decision maker aims to maximize social welfare via implementing regulations, policies, plans, transit service designs, etc. The MSP aims to maximize profit by adjusting its service designs. Travelers aim to maximize utility by changing their modes and routes. The travelers? decisions depend on the regulator and MSP?s decisions while the MSP decisions themselves depend on the regulator?s decisions. To solve the tri-level mathematical program, the study employs Bayesian optimization (BO) within a simulation?optimization solution approach. At the lowest level, the solution approach includes an agent-based transportation system simulation model to capture travelers? behavior subject to specific decisions made by the regulator and MSP. At the middle and highest levels, the solution approach employs BO for the MSP to maximize profit and for the regulator to maximize social welfare. The agent-based transportation simulation model includes a mode choice model, a road network, a transit network, and an MSP providing automated mobility-on-demand (AMOD) service with shared rides. The modeling and solution approaches are applied to Munich, Germany in order to validate the model. The case study investigates the tolls and parking costs the city administration should set, as well as changes in the public transport budget and a limitation of the AMOD fleet size. Best policy settings are derived for two social welfare definitions, in both of which the AMOD fleet size is not regulated as the shared-ride AMOD service provides significant value to travelers in Munich.

AB This paper discusses the design, fabrication, and characterization of an ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) actuator-based bio-inspired active fin capable of bending and twisting motion. It is pointed out that IPMC strip actuators are used in the simple cantilever configuration to create simple bending (flapping-like) motion for propulsion in underwater autonomous systems. However, the resulting motion is a simple 1D bending and performance is rather limited. To enable more complex deformation, such as the flapping (pitch and heaving) motion of real pectoral and caudal fish fins, a new approach which involves molding or integrating IPMC actuators into a soft boot material to create an active control surface (called a 'fin') is presented. The fin can be used to realize complex deformation depending on the orientation and placement of the actuators. In contrast to previously created IPMCs with patterned electrodes for the same purpose, the proposed design avoids (1) the more expensive process of electroless plating platinum all throughout the surface of the actuator and (2) the need for specially patterning the electrodes. Therefore, standard shaped IPMC actuators such as those with rectangular dimensions with varying thicknesses can be used. One unique advantage of the proposed structural design is that custom shaped fins and control surfaces can be easily created without special materials processing. The molding process is cost effective and does not require functionalizing or 'activating' the boot material similar to creating IPMCs. For a prototype fin (90 mm wide x 60 mm long x 1.5 mm thick), the measured maximum tip displacement was approximately 44 mm and the twist angle of the fin exceeded 10 degrees. Lift and drag measurements in water where the prototype fin with an airfoil profile was dragged through water at a velocity of 21 cm s(-1) showed that the lift and drag forces can be affected by controlling the IPMCs embedded into the fin structure. These results suggest that such IPMC-enabled fin designs can be used for developing active propeller blades or control surfaces on underwater vehicles.

AB Motion-planning algorithms play a vital role in attaining various levels of autonomy for any ground or flying agent. Three-dimensional (3D) motion-planning is interesting, but rather complex, especially for flying agents such as autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), due to the increased dimensionality of space and consideration of dynamical constraints for a feasible trajectory. Usually, in 3D path search problems, it is hard to avoid extra expanded nodes due to increased dimensionality with various available search options. Therefore, this paper discusses and implements a modified heuristic-based A* formalism that uses a truncation mechanism in order to eradicate the mentioned problem. In this formalism, the complete motion planning is divided into shortest path search problem and smooth trajectory generation. The shortest path search problem is subdivided into an initial naive guess of the path and the truncation of the extra nodes. To find a naive shortest path, a conventional two-dimensional (2D) A* algorithm is augmented for 3D space with six-sided search. This approach led to the inclusion of extra expanded nodes and, therefore, it is not the shortest one. Hence, a truncation algorithm is developed to further process this path in order to truncate the extra expanded nodes and then to shorten the path length. This new approach significantly reduces the path length and renders only those nodes that are obstacle-free. The latter is ensured using a collision detection algorithm during the truncation process. Subsequently, the nodes of this shortened path are used to generate a dynamically feasible and optimal trajectory for the quadrotor UAV. Optimal trajectory generation requires that the plant dynamics must be differentially flat. Therefore, the corresponding proof is presented to ensure generation of the optimal trajectory. This optimal trajectory minimizes the control effort and ensures longer endurance. Moreover, quadrotor model and controllers are derived as preliminaries, which are subsequently used to track the desired trajectory generated by the trajectory planner. Finally, results of numerical simulations which ultimately validate the theoretical developments are presented.

AB The operation of future intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), communications infrastructure (CI), and power grids (PGs) will be highly interdependent. In particular, autonomous connected vehicles require CI resources to operate, and, thus, communication failures can result in nonoptimality in the ITS flow in terms of traffic jams and fuel consumption. Similarly, CI components, e.g., base stations (BSs) can be impacted by failures in the electric grid that is powering them. Thus, malicious attacks on the PG can lead to failures in both the CI and the ITSs. To this end, in this article, the security of an ITS against indirect attacks carried out through the PG is studied in an interdependent PG-CI-ITS scenario. In the considered scenario, an attacker can induce nonoptimality in the ITS or disrupt a particular set of streets by attacking the PG components while remaining stealthy from the ITS administrators. To defend against such attacks, the administrator of the interdependent critical infrastructure can allocate backup power sources (BPSs) at every BS to compensate for the power loss caused by the attacker. However, due to budget limitations, the administrator must consider the importance of each BS in light of the PG risk of failure, while allocating the BPSs. In this regard, a rigorous analytical framework is proposed to model the interdependencies between the ITS, CI, and PG. Next, a one-to-one relationship between the PG components and ITS streets is derived in order to capture the effect of the PG components' failure on the optimality of the traffic flow in the streets. Moreover, the problem of BPS allocation is formulated using a Stackelberg game framework and the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) of the game is characterized. Simulation results show that the derived SE outperforms any other BPS allocation strategy and can be scalable in linear time with respect to the size of the interdependent infrastructure.

TI Monitoring the resilience of a no-take marine reserve to a range
   extending species using benthic imagery
SO PLOS ONE
LA English

ID SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION; PROTECTED AREAS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; REEF
AB Global climate change is driving the redistribution of marine species and thereby potentially restructuring endemic communities. Understanding how localised conservation measures such as protection from additional human pressures can confer resilience to ecosystems is therefore an important area of research. Here, we examine the resilience of a no-take marine reserve (NTR) to the establishment of urchin barrens habitat. The barrens habitat is created through overgrazing of kelp by an invading urchin species that is expanding its range within a hotspot of rapid climate change. In our study region, a multi-year monitoring program provides a unique time-series of benthic imagery collected by an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) within an NTR and nearby reference areas. We use a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal modelling approach to estimate whether the NTR is associated with reduced formation of urchin barrens, and thereby enhances local resilience. Our approach controls for the important environmental covariates of depth and habitat complexity (quantified as rugosity derived from multibeam sonar mapping), as well as spatial and temporal dependence. We find evidence for the NTR conferring resilience with a strong reserve effect that suggests improved resistance to the establishment of barrens. However, we find a concerning and consistent trajectory of increasing barrens cover in both the reference areas and the NTR, with the odds of barrens increasing by approximately 32% per year. Thus, whereas the reserve is demonstrating resilience to the initial establishment of barrens, there is currently no evidence of recovery once barrens are established. We also find that depth and rugosity covariates derived from multibeam mapping provide useful predictors for barrens occurrence. These results have important management implications as they demonstrate: (i) the importance of monitoring programs to inform adaptive management; (ii) that NTRs provide a potential local conservation management tool under climate change impacts, and (iii) that technologies such as AUVs and multibeam mapping can be harnessed to inform regional decision-making. Continuation of the current monitoring program is required to assess whether the NTR can provide long term protection from a phase shift that replaces kelp with urchin barrens.

AB Mobile Mapping is an efficient technology to acquire spatial data of the environment. The spatial data is fundamental for applications in crisis management, civil engineering or autonomous driving. The extrinsic calibration of the Mobile Mapping System is a decisive factor that affects the quality of the spatial data. Many existing extrinsic calibration approaches require the use of artificial targets in a time-consuming calibration procedure. Moreover, they are usually designed for a specific combination of sensors and are, thus, not universally applicable. We introduce a novel extrinsic self-calibration algorithm, which is fully automatic and completely data-driven. The fundamental assumption of the self-calibration is that the calibration parameters are estimated the best when the derived point cloud represents the real physical circumstances the best. The cost function we use to evaluate this is based on geometric features which rely on the 3D structure tensor derived from the local neighborhood of each point. We compare different cost functions based on geometric features and a cost function based on the Renyi quadratic entropy to evaluate the suitability for the self-calibration. Furthermore, we perform tests of the self-calibration on synthetic and two different real datasets. The real datasets differ in terms of the environment, the scale and the utilized sensors. We show that the self-calibration is able to extrinsically calibrate Mobile Mapping Systems with different combinations of mapping and pose estimation sensors such as a 2D laser scanner to a Motion Capture System and a 3D laser scanner to a stereo camera and ORB-SLAM2. For the first dataset, the parameters estimated by our self-calibration lead to a more accurate point cloud than two comparative approaches. For the second dataset, which has been acquired via a vehicle-based mobile mapping, our self-calibration achieves comparable results to a manually refined reference calibration, while it is universally applicable and fully automated.

AB Mind-wandering involves a lapse in attention due to preoccupation with one's own thoughts, the experience of which may interfere with performance on a primary task. The goal of this study was to investigate how task length and fatigue influenced the tendency to mind-wander while driving. We were also interested in whether the propensity to mind-wander could be predicted by individual differences in sustained attention, as measured by the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART). Participants completed three 20-25 min drives, during which time pre-recorded thought-probes prompted participants to answer whether they were thinking of driving. Mind-wandering was measured both during the drive (in terms of the percentage of thought-probe trials where drivers reported that they were not thinking of driving), as well post-task (in terms of self-rated difficulty in focusing attention). Driving speed, steering variability and hazard response time were measured by the driving simulator, and drivers also rated their performance post-task. There were significant increases in self-rated difficulty focusing with time on task, and non-significant increases in reported mind-wandering. Driving speeds and steering variability also increased with time on task, but individual differences in sustained attention as measured by the SART did not predict these changes. Overall, the best advance predictor of mind-wandering was the number of hours of sleep the previous night. Mind-wandering and difficulty focusing were correlated with negative emotional rumination (e.g., worries, guilt, anger), though it is unclear whether negative emotionality causes mind-wandering or vice versa. This research has implications for both basic and applied research on individual differences and cognitive distraction, as well as practical safety implications in areas of driver training and autonomous vehicle development.

TI Analysis of Lidar Actuator System Influence on the Quality of Dense 3D

AB Mobile mapping technologies, based on techniques such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and surface-from-motion (SfM), are being vigorously developed both in the scientific community and in industry. They are crucial concepts for automated 3D surveying and autonomous vehicles. For various applications, rotating multiline scanners, manufactured, for example, by Velodyne and Ouster, are utilized as the main sensor of the mapping hardware system. However, their principle of operation has a substantial drawback, as their scanning pattern creates natural gaps between the scanning lines. In some models, the vertical lidar field of view can also be severely limited. To overcome these issues, more sensors could be employed, which would significantly increase the cost of the mapping system. Instead, some investigators have added a tilting or rotating motor to the lidar. Although the effectiveness of such a solution is usually clearly visible, its impact on the quality of the acquired 3D data has not yet been investigated. This paper presents an adjustable mapping system, which allows for switching between a stable, tilting or fully rotating lidar position. A simple experiment in a building corridor was performed, simulating the conditions of a mobile robot passing through a narrow tunnel: a common setting for applications, such as mining surveying or industrial facility inspection. A SLAM algorithm is utilized to create a coherent 3D point cloud of the mapped corridor for three settings of the sensor movement. The extent of improvement in the 3D data quality when using the tilting and rotating lidar, compared to keeping a stable position, is quantified. Different metrics are proposed to account for different aspects of the 3D data quality, such as completeness, density and geometry coherence. The ability of SLAM algorithms to faithfully represent selected objects appearing in the mapped scene is also examined. The results show that the fully rotating solution is optimal in terms of most of the metrics analyzed. However, the improvement observed from a horizontally mounted sensor to a tilting sensor was the most significant.

AB The shallow migration path of mudflow of the mud volcano MV420 on the continental slope of the Canadian Beaufort Sea is investigated in terms of thermal and geotechnical characteristics. MV420 is a nearly flat topped active mud volcano that emits methane and fluidized mud. Its top is at a depth of water of 420 m, within the gas hydrate stability zone. During the summer 2017 IBRV Araon expedition, several measurements of marine heat flow were conducted in the area of juvenile mud mound/pond morphologies identified by multibeam bathymetry and backscatter intensity images obtained by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute's autonomous underwater vehicle. The heat probe (a gravity corer with temperature, pressure, and tilt sensors) appeared to penetrate to a depth of > 70 m below the seafloor. The sediment bulk density in the mudflow migration path of MV420, estimated by pressure change with controlled stretches of a winch cable, was 1.56 g/cm(3). The subsurface temperature reaches up to 18 degrees C and profiles show that the maximum local temperature occurs from 20 to 40 m below the seafloor, implying substantial vertical variability of geothermal gradients. Our finding of large positive and small negative geothermal gradients above and below the depth of the local temperature maximum may represent stagnant hot mud along the mudflow migration path, indicating a pulsative eruption of the mudflow. Gas hydrate is stable only within a few meter thick layer near the seafloor above the path because of the cold bottom water (0.4 degrees C) covering the top of the mud volcano. Furthermore, the thermal conductivity of 0.939 W/m/K and the marine heat flow of 22.5 mW/m(2) at a control site outside MV420 is estimated as the background heat flow in the slope, for which little data exists.

AB A standing data gap for management of high-seas seamounts of the Northwestern Hawaiian Ridge and Emperor Seamounts (ES-NHR) by the North Pacific Fisheries Commission is the footprint of fisheries activities on these seamounts. Using satellite AIS data and the algorithms of the publicly available Global Fishing Watch database, a spatial map of trawling in a 0.01-degree latitude by 0.01-degree longitude square grid was created to review the data available to map this footprint. From 2012 to 2018 much of the trawling effort for all countries focused on Koko, Yuryaku, Kammu, and Colahan Seamounts at depths between 400 m (summits) and the depth limit currently set by the North Pacific Fisheries Commission of 1500 m. Additional seamounts with fishing activity included Annei (North Koko), Kinmei, Jingu, and Suiko. The remaining ES-NHR seamount locations show no trawling in those years. Bottom contact fishing was predominately carried out by ships with flag states of Japan and Korea. To date there appears to be compliance with the recent small-scale closures on C-H seamount and Koko.
   An additional source of data comes from scientific Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) surveys in 2014 and 2015 from three of these seamounts, in which scars from bottom contact gear are readily visible. These cover a smaller spatial area and depth range than the satellite data, but indicate the full footprint is not encompassed by the satellite data, suggesting either the fishing footprint is not fully captured by the AIS approach or that the footprint has shifted through time. AUV surveys also provide data on areas where abundant megafauna occur, which can provide candidate starting points for VME management efforts and further closures, similar to ones already in effect in the ES-NHR. The combination of satellite and AUV data provide a finer-scale fisheries footprint for this region that can aid in management of these sites.

AB Social distancing is a recommended solution by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to minimise the spread of COVID-19 in public places. The majority of governments and national health authorities have set the 2-m physical distancing as a mandatory safety measure in shopping centres, schools and other covered areas. In this research, we develop a hybrid Computer Vision and YOLOv4-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for automated people detection in the crowd in indoor and outdoor environments using common CCTV security cameras. The proposed DNN model in combination with an adapted inverse perspective mapping (IPM) technique and SORT tracking algorithm leads to a robust people detection and social distancing monitoring. The model has been trained against two most comprehensive datasets by the time of the research-the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) and Google Open Image datasets. The system has been evaluated against the Oxford Town Centre dataset (including 150,000 instances of people detection) with superior performance compared to three state-of-the-art methods. The evaluation has been conducted in challenging conditions, including occlusion, partial visibility, and under lighting variations with the mean average precision of 99.8% and the real-time speed of 24.1 fps. We also provide an online infection risk assessment scheme by statistical analysis of the spatio-temporal data from people's moving trajectories and the rate of social distancing violations. We identify high-risk zones with the highest possibility of virus spread and infection. This may help authorities to redesign the layout of a public place or to take precaution actions to mitigate high-risk zones. The developed model is a generic and accurate people detection and tracking solution that can be applied in many other fields such as autonomous vehicles, human action recognition, anomaly detection, sports, crowd analysis, or any other research areas where the human detection is in the centre of attention.

AB For efficient suspension development, objective performance indicators are needed which quantify the system with regard to ride comfort. This paper aims to investigate the capabilities of objectification methods from literature and presents a new method for automated and autonomous driving situations. Two studies were conducted in order to investigate objectification methods for ride comfort. In the first study, different objectification methods from literature were tested and compared. Sixteen subjects drove on a country road with a BMW 650i (F06). The subjects had to rate different damper settings which were tested at the same road section. The sensor data was evaluated according to ISO-2631:1997 (equal to VDI-2057:2017), BS 6841:1987, as well as according to the methods of Rericha, Cucuz, Klingner and Hennecke. As subjective ratings imply ordinally scaled data sets, the correlation between the objective values and the subjective ratings is tested with the rank-correlation coefficient Kendalls-Tau and exploratory statistical methods. In the second study, forty participants drove and were driven around country roads in a BMW 135i (F20). The inattentive occupants had to perform an activity on a tablet which distracted them from the current driving situation. The subjects had to rate the ride comfort on four different road sections. Measurements have been conducted with a self-developed body measurement system and a seat pad sensor according to ISO-10326. The measurements and subjective ratings were correlated and statistically analyzed. The results of the first Study show that the ISO-2631, VDI-2057 and BS 6841:1987 perform best under the given test conditions. The method of Klingner shows the best results of the non-standardized methods. The results of the second study show a significant difference in comfort perception between attentive and inattentive occupants. It can also be seen that inattentive occupants show higher values of RMS accelerations measured at the head, which is also visible in the vehicle to head transmissibility.

AB With the emergence of innovations associated with public transport (PT) services, such as Mobility-as-a-Service, demand responsive transit, and autonomous vehicles, the door-to-door PT journey is achievable via multiple transfers between and within different PT modes. As such, seamless transfers between different modes of public transportation become an increasingly important factor for the attractiveness of PT services. At the same time, recent developments in travel time prediction methodologies offer new, reliable data sources for the optimization of PT operations. This work, with the consideration of these two elements, develops a mixed integer linear programming model for the PT schedule synchronization problem. The novelty is threefold. First, a novel concept of path-oriented scheduling is proposed. The path transfer time is explicitly formulated and minimized to provide a seamless travel experience considering that the emerging multimodal mobility inevitably induces multiple transfers. Second, time dependent travel time data is also utilized in the model, which allows us to harness new and more representative data sources for improving PT services. Third, in order to complement the increase in computational complexity as a result of the utilization of time-dependent travel time data, three novel valid inequalities (VIs) are derived. Numerical studies show that the use of time-dependent travel time data is beneficial in terms of reducing path transfer times, when compared to using the mean historical travel times. The numerical study also reveals a tradeoff between the maximum allowable path transfer time and trip time. Using simulation studies on three bus lines in Copenhagen, we demonstrate that the valid inequalities could reduce the computation time by 8.5% on average, where the maximum reduction of computation time could reach 54.0%. The proposed valid inequalities are benchmarked against two classes of valid inequalities in the literature. It is found that the proposed valid inequalities could outperform those in the literature. We also found that further improvement in computational performance can be attained by using a combination of the proposed valid inequalities.

ID MOBILE EDGE
AB Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm such that client data are processed at the periphery of the network, as close as possible to the originating source. Since the 21st century has come to be known as the century of data due to the rapid increase in the quantity of exchanged data worldwide (especially in smart city applications such as autonomous vehicles), collecting and processing such data from sensors and Internet of Things devices operating in real time from remote locations and inhospitable operating environments almost anywhere in the world is a relevant emerging need. Indeed, edge computing is reshaping information technology and business computing. In this respect, the paper is aimed at providing a comprehensive overview of what edge computing is as well as the most relevant edge use cases, tradeoffs, and implementation considerations. In particular, this review article is focused on highlighting (i) the most recent trends relative to edge computing emerging in the research field and (ii) the main businesses that are taking operations at the edge as well as the most used edge computing platforms (both proprietary and open source). First, the paper summarizes the concept of edge computing and compares it with cloud computing. After that, we discuss the challenges of optimal server placement, data security in edge networks, hybrid edge-cloud computing, simulation platforms for edge computing, and state-of-the-art improved edge networks. Finally, we explain the edge computing applications to 5G/6G networks and industrial internet of things. Several studies review a set of attractive edge features, system architectures, and edge application platforms that impact different industry sectors. The experimental results achieved in the cited works are reported in order to prove how edge computing improves the efficiency of Internet of Things networks. On the other hand, the work highlights possible vulnerabilities and open issues emerging in the context of edge computing architectures, thus proposing future directions to be investigated.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Detection and diagnosis of the plant diseases in the early stage significantly minimize yield losses. Image-based automated plant diseases identification (APDI) tools have started to been widely used in pest managements strategies. The current APDI systems rely on images captured in laboratory conditions, which hardens the usage of the APDI systems by smallholder farmers. In this study, we investigate whether the smallholder farmers can exploit APDI systems using their basic and cheap unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs) with standard cameras. To create the tomato images like the one taken by UAVs, we build a new dataset from a public dataset by using image processing tools. The dataset includes tomato leaf photographs separated into 10 classes (diseases or healthy). To detect the diseases, we develop a new hybrid detection model, called SpikingTomaNet, which merges a novel deep convolutional neural network model with spiking neural network (SNN) model. This hybrid model provides both better accuracy rates for the plant diseases identification and more energy efficiency for the battery-constrained UAVs due to the SNN's event-driven architecture. In this hybrid model, the features extracted from the CNN model are used as the input layer for SNNs. To assess our approach's performance, firstly, we compare the proposed CNN model inside the developed hybrid model with well-known AlexNet, VggNet-5 and LeNet models. Secondly, we compare the developed hybrid model with three hybrid models composed of combinations of the well-known models and SNN model. To train and test the proposed neural network, 32022 images in the dataset are exploited. The results show that the SNN method significantly increases the success, especially in the augmented dataset. The experiment result shows that while the proposed hybrid model provides 97.78% accuracy on original images, its success on the created datasets is between 59.97%-82.98%. In addition, the results shows that the proposed hybrid model provides better overall accuracy in the classification of the diseases in comparison to the well-known models and LeNet and their combination with SNN.

AB In the era of "Industry 4.0", individualized demand and small batch customization manufacturing will become the trend, which calls for strong capabilities of customer orientation and rapid reaction. In addition to the redesign of smart and autonomous production processes, the market-oriented frugal innovation is a valuable exploration under the framework of "Industry 4.0". This paper anchors itself at a deprecated policy context to study frugal innovation patterns and their forming mechanisms, which is still a rarely touched area. By selecting as its cases Shifeng, Baoya and Taiqi from the Shandong province, China, this paper uses a qualitative approach to analyze low-speed electric vehicle (EV) businesses according to a three-dimension frugal innovation framework composed by business ecosystem (BE) configurations, BE capabilities and innovation process. The findings are as follows, (1) there are three typical frugal innovation patterns, namely market-based persistence, market-based contingency and technology-based contingency, which help frugal innovators obtain an abundant market performance even under a deprecated policy environment; (2) a vertical integration network and strong marketing capabilities are the capital to select a market-based persistence pattern, while the lack of some substantial resources and capabilities compels firms to have to adopt a more flexible way of frugal innovation in order to carve out a safe niche. This paper contributes to frugal innovation research by exploring a new deprecated policy context rather than traditional institution voids, constructing a frugal innovation framework from the BE perspective by focusing on focal firms, and proposing three frugal innovation patterns under different resource constraints. From the practical side, this paper suggests that future innovation policy should balance advanced technology requirements and practical market demands, and the governments should also emphasize market positioning and demand orientation in the process of Industry 4.0 transformation.

AB Nearly 1.24 million people die every year in traffic accidents. More than 20% of the number of deaths are pedestrians. Traffic crashes will become, in 2030, the fifth leading cause of deaths worldwide. A considerable amount of these accidents occurs due to either imprudence or lack of dexterity of the driver. More than 70% of traffic accidents are attributed to human error, such as perception errors as distance judgment error or simply by lack of attention. Because of the problem aforementioned, this work proposes the development and discussion of a pedestrian recognition system using an automotive radar of 79 GHz. The main idea is to early detect pedestrians using the micro Doppler characteristics of the human body in near to crash situations (0-15 m). Based on these requirements, at first this work presents the improvement of velocity resolution of the radar system with the objective of extracting the micro Doppler characteristics of the objects. The improvement of velocity resolution was reached assuming the application of multi-objective optimization techniques, in this case Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Random Search (RS) were adopted, enhancing the quality of the radar signal. Based on radar measures of velocity and range, a machine learning approach was considered in order to classify objects detected by the radar. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method was assumed to distinguish pedestrians and non-pedestrians objects. Four different SVM based models were considered in this work, aiming the improvement of both classification performance and speed, comparing three different kernel functions. As a result, it was possible to verify the advantages of the multi-objective optimization to extract the micro Doppler effects based on radar signals. Moreover, the optimization reached the velocity resolution of 0.12 m/s. To conclude, we showed that a model involving a polynomial kernel for the SVM reported better result in terms of accuracy (99.5%), confirming the promising perspectives of vehicles embedded radar-based safety systems.

TI Robotic assembly and maintenance of future space stations based on the

SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
AB MDA has provided 25 years of real-time engineering support to Shuttle (Canadarm) and ISS (Canadarm2) robotic operations beginning with the second shuttle flight STS-2 in 1981. In this capacity, our engineering support teams have become familiar with the evolution of mission planning and flight support practices for robotic assembly and support operations at mission control. This paper presents observations on existing practices and ideas to achieve reduced operational overhead to present programs. It also identifies areas where robotic assembly and maintenance of future space stations and space-based facilities could be accomplished more effectively and efficiently.
   Specifically, our experience shows that past and current space Shuttle and ISS assembly and maintenance operations have used the approach of extensive preflight mission planning and training to prepare the flight crews for the entire mission. This has been driven by the overall communication latency between the earth and remote location of the space station/vehicle as well as the lack of consistent robotic and interface standards. While the early Shuttle and ISS architectures included robotics. their eventual benefits on the overall assembly and maintenance operations could have been greater through incorporating them as a major design driver from the beginning of the system design. Lessons learned from the ISS highlight the potential benefits of real-time health monitoring systems, consistent standards for robotic interfaces and procedures and automated script-driven ground control in future space station assembly and logistics architectures. In addition, advances in computer vision systems and remote operation, supervised autonomous command and control systems offer the potential to adjust the balance between assembly and maintenance tasks performed using extra vehicular activity (EVA), extra vehicular robotics (EVR) and EVR controlled from the ground, offloading the EVA astronaut and even the robotic operator on-orbit of some of the more routine tasks. Overall these proposed approaches when used effectively offer the potential to drive down operations overhead and allow more efficient and productive robotic operations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The specific features and requirements of island regions and rural areas make Mobility as a Service (MaaS) an attractive and evolving concept in the realm of Intercity/Rural/Island transportation. The primary goal of this research is to provide qualitative insights relative to the added value and development of MaaS for the previously mentioned transport services through a case study from Greece, a country with approximately 250 inhabited islands. In island settings, the primary societal motivation for MaaS is to enhance the accessibility of islands and improve individuals' access to multiple transport services. MaaS is found to have a strong potential to act as an enabler for more efficient transport and better accessibility to remote/island locations, acting in a complementary manner with currently applied "external" measures such as the Greek "Transport Equivalent". To further assess the potential, development and impact of MaaS a focus group comprised by key-representatives from industry and academia stakeholders is created. The MaaS Ecosystem, as described by the experts, is comprised of the MaaS Provider, all the intercity/rural/island transport providers currently operating in the Greek market, MaaS Enabling entities (associations, regulators, investors, research institutions), the Integration Drivers and the customers. The issue of transport providers' liability in case of disruptions and existing market regulations constitute, according to the results, an important challenge towards development of an Intercity MaaS, which needs to be addressed by legislative studies in a pan-European level. Most likely user groups for Intercity/Rural/Island MaaS are young people and digitally educated people, whilst less likely patronage groups are the elderly and "vulnerable" population groups. Relative to the external environment, high degree of fragmentation of the intercity transport industry combined by "autonomous" behavior of actors ("silo effect") appears to be the greatest threat towards MaaS whilst anticipated capital investments in infrastructure and vehicles, which are foreseen in the proxime future, are the greatest opportunities.

AB PurposeIn the digital age, emerging technologies have affected every industry. Information and communications technology and digital technologies have transformed traditional supply chains into smart and more resilient ones, enabling effective management of challenges. Given the importance of the two topics, namely sustainable supply chain management and Industry 4.0 in supply chain management, on the one hand, and the dearth of theoretical research performed in this area on the other, this study aims to propose a conceptual model on a sustainable digital supply chain management in manufacturing companies.Design/methodology/approachThis study utilized a qualitative approach. First, an in-depth review of the relevant literature was done. Then, following a multi-grounded theory methodology, relevant data were gathered by reviewing 92 papers and conducting nine semi-structured interviews with industry experts. These data were analyzed using the MAXQDA software.FindingsA total of 41 concepts, ten sub-components and three main components (dimensions) were extracted, and the proposed conceptual model was presented. Finally, based on this conceptual model, three propositions were suggested.Research limitations/implicationsConsidering that the present study was performed in the context of Iranian manufacturing companies, caution should be exercised in relation to the generalizability of the obtained results. Also, due to the problems in the digital technology infrastructure and the limited use of these technologies by manufacturing companies (emphasized by the interviewees), this study focused on the theoretical dimension of using digital technologies by these companies.Practical implicationsThe proposed comprehensive model can help academicians as well as practitioners to focus better and explore the variables and constructs of the model, paving the way toward successful implementation of digital technologies in the manufacturing supply chain.Originality/valueTo the best knowledge of the authors, this study is among the first of its kind which presents a holistic and comprehensive digital supply chain model aimed at guiding companies to consider sustainability from all the main dimensions and their relevant indicators.

AB Belt-positioning boosters (BPB) may prevent submarining in novel seating configurations such as seats with reclined seatbacks. However, several knowledge gaps in the motion of reclined child occupants remain as pre-vious reclined child studies only examined responses of a child anthropomorphic test device (ATD) and the PIPER finite element (FE) model in frontal impacts. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of reclined seatback angles and two types of BPBs on the motion of child volunteer occupants in low-acceleration far-side lateral-oblique impacts.
   Six healthy children (3 males, 3 females, 6-8 years, seated height: 66 +/- 3.2 cm, weight: 25.2 +/- 3.2 kg) were seated on two types of low-back BPB (standard and lightweight) on a vehicle seat and restrained by a 3-point simulated-integrated seatbelt on a low-acceleration sled. The sled exposed the participants to a low-speed lateral-oblique (80 degrees from frontal) pulse (2 g). Three seatback recline angles (25 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees from vertical) with two BPB (standard and lightweight) were tested. A 10-camera 3D-motion-capture system (Natural Point Inc.) was used to capture peak lateral head and trunk displacements and forward knee-head distance. Three seat-belt load cells (Denton ATD Inc) captured peak seatbelt loads. Electromyography (EMG, Delsys Inc) recorded muscle activation. Repeated Measure 2-way ANOVAs were performed to evaluate the effect of seatback recline angle and BPB on kinematics. Tukey's post-hoc test for pairwise comparisons was used. P-level was set to 0.05.
   Peak lateral head and trunk displacement decreased with the increasing seatback recline angle (p < 0.005, p < 0.001, respectively). Lateral peak head displacement was greater in the 25 degrees compared to the 60 degrees condition (p < 0.002) and in the 45 degrees condition compared to the 60 degrees condition (p < 0.04). Lateral peak trunk displacement was greater in the 25 degrees condition than the 45 degrees condition (p < 0.009) and the 60 degrees condition (p < 0.001), and in the 45 degrees condition than the 60 degrees condition (p < 0.03). Overall peak lateral head and trunk displacements and knee -head forward distance were slightly greater in the standard than the lightweight BPB (p < 0.04), however these differences between BPBs were small (similar to 10 mm).
   Shoulder belt peak load decreased as the reclined seatback angle increased (p < 0.03): the shoulder belt peak load was statistically greater in the 25 degrees condition than the 60 degrees condition (p < 0.02). Muscle activation from the neck, upper trunk, and lower legs showed great activation. Neck muscles activation increased with the increase in seatback recline angle. Thighs, upper arms, and abdominal muscles showed small activation and no effect of conditions.
   Child volunteers showed decreased displacement suggesting that reclined seatbacks placed the booster-seated children in a more favorable position within the shoulder belt in a low-acceleration lateral-oblique impact, compared to nominal seatback angles. BPB type seemed to minimally influence the children's motion: the small differences found may have been due to the slight difference in heights between the two BPBs. Future research with more severe pulses is needed to better understand reclined children's motion in far-side lateral-oblique impacts.

AB A detailed analysis of optical and microphysical properties of aerosol particles during the dry winter monsoon season above the northern Indian Ocean is presented. The Cloud Aerosol Radiative Forcing Experiment (CARDEX), conducted from 16 February to 30 March 2012 at the Maldives Climate Observatory on Hanimaadhoo island (MCOH) in the Republic of the Maldives, used autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (AUAV) to perform vertical in situ measurements of particle number concentration, particle number size distribution as well as particle absorption coefficients. These measurements were used together with surface-based Mini Micro Pulse Lidar (MiniMPL) observations and aerosol in situ and off-line measurements to investigate the vertical distribution of aerosol particles.
   Air masses were mainly advected over the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian Peninsula. The mean surface aerosol number concentration was 1717 +/- 604cm(-3) and the highest values were found in air masses from the Bay of Bengal and Indo-Gangetic Plain (2247 +/- 370cm(-3)). Investigations of the free tropospheric air showed that elevated aerosol layers with up to 3 times higher aerosol number concentrations than at the surface occurred mainly during periods with air masses originating from the Bay of Bengal and the Indo-Gangetic Plain. This feature is different compared to what was observed during the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX) conducted in winter 1999, where aerosol number concentrations generally decreased with height. In contrast, lower particle absorption at the surface (sigma(abs)(520nm) = 8.5 + 4.2Wm(-1)) was found during CARDEX compared to INDOEX 1999.
   Layers with source region specific single-scattering albedo (SSA) values were derived by combining vertical in situ particle absorption coefficients and scattering coefficients calculated with Mie theory. These SSA layers were utilized to calculate vertical particle absorption profiles from MiniMPL profiles. SSA surface values for 550 nm for dry conditions were found to be 0 : 94 +/- 0 : 02 and 0 : 91 +/- 0 : 02 for air masses from the Arabian Sea (and Middle East countries) and India (and Bay of Bengal), respectively. Lidar-derived particle absorption coefficient profiles showed both a similar magnitude and structure as the in situ profiles measured with the AUAV. However, primarily due to insufficient accuracy in the SSA estimates, the lidar-derived absorption coefficient profiles have large uncertainties and are generally weakly correlated to vertically in situ measured particle absorption coefficients.
   Furthermore, the mass absorption efficiency (MAE) for the northern Indian Ocean during the dry monsoon season was calculated to determine equivalent black carbon (EBC) concentrations from particle absorption coefficient measurements. A mean MAE of 11.6 and 6.9m(2) g(-1) for 520 and 880 nm, respectively, was found, likely representing internally mixed BC containing particles. Lower MAE values for 880 and 520 nm were found for air masses originating from dust regions such as the Arabian Peninsula and western Asia (MAE(880 nm) = 5.6m(2) g(-1), MAE(520 nm) = 9.5m(2) g(-1)) or from closer source regions as southern India (MAE(880 nm) = 4.3m(2) g(-1), MAE(520 nm) = 7. 3m(2) g(-1)).

AB Real-time kinematic (RTK) is a technique frequently utilized to provide real-time highly precise positioning services for mobile Internet-of-Things (IoT)-embedded terminals from intelligence appliances and smartphones to autonomous drones and self-driving vehicles. To fully utilize hardware resources, the internal GNSS chips or modules equipped in IoT terminals should satisfy the traits of energy efficiency and low computational complexity. As the number of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) increases, the continuous accumulation of high-dimensional rounding errors, the rough system model, and seriously distorted observations will result in divergence and considerable processing burden in the conventional Kalman filter (KF) process. Computational efficiency is significant in the reduction in the power consumption and intensifies the positioning performance of GNSS receivers. Here, a new filter strategy based on UD factorization, where U stands for the unit upper-triangular factor and D indicates the diagonal factor, is proposed for RTK positioning to enhance the numerical stability and reduce the computational effort. The equivalent principle was applied to turn double-difference (DD) observations into zero-difference (ZD) observations. Then, the UD-factorization-based Kalman filter (UD-KF) is proposed as a way to sequentially provide accurate real-time estimations of the filter states and variance-covariance (VC) matrix. Both static and dynamic tests were carried out with single-frequency data from a GPS to evaluate the performance of UD-KF. The results of the zero-baseline test show that UD-KF can obtain smaller RMS of the estimated parameters as the noise of DD observations was twice that of the ZD observations. A short baseline test showed that, compared to the regular filter approach with DD observations, UD-KF achieved a shorter computation time with a higher data utilization rate for both filtering and fixing stages, with an average improvement of 32% and 18%. Finally, a dynamic test showed that the UD-KF can avoid the undesirable effect of satellite changes. Therefore, compared to KF with DD observations, the UD-KF with equivalent ZD observations can enhance the robustness as well as improve the positioning accuracy of RTK positioning.

AB Triple modular redundancy (TMR) is one of the most common techniques in fault-tolerant systems, in which the output is determined by a majority voter. However, the design diversity of replicated modules and/or soft errors that are more likely to happen in the nanoscale era may affect the majority voting scheme. Besides, the significant overheads of the TMR scheme may limit its usage in energy consumption and area-constrained critical systems. However, for most inherently error-resilient applications such as image processing and vision deployed in critical systems (such as autonomous vehicles and robotics), achieving a given level of reliability has more priority than precise results. Therefore, these applications can benefit from the approximate computing paradigm to achieve higher energy efficiency and a lower area. This article proposes an energy-efficient approximate reliability (X-Rel) framework to overcome the aforementioned challenges of the TMR systems and get the full potential of approximate computing without sacrificing the desired reliability constraint and output quality. The X-Rel framework relies on relaxing the precision of the voter based on a systematical error bounding method that leverages user-defined quality and reliability constraints. Afterward, the size of the achieved voter is used to approximate the TMR modules such that the overall area and energy consumption are minimized. The effectiveness of employing the proposed X-Rel technique in a TMR structure, for different quality constraints as well as with various reliability bounds, is evaluated in a 15-nm FinFET technology. The results of the X-Rel voter show delay, area, and energy consumption reductions of up to 86%, 87%, and 98%, respectively, when compared to those of the state-of-the-art approximate TMR voters. Also, the effectiveness of the proposed X-Rel-based TMR structure is assessed in four benchmark applications from different domains. For these benchmarks, the results show 1.59x, 2.35x, and 3.39x energy-delay-area-product (EDAP) reduction for less than 1%, 5%, and 10% output quality degradations, respectively. Finally, an image processing application is benchmarked to evaluate the X-Rel framework efficacy in the presence of errors, where the results show up to a 4.78x higher output image quality in comparison with the typical TMR voters.

AB Time- and precision-critical applications, such as autonomous driving, have extremely rigorous standards for continuous high-precision positioning. The importance of precise point positioning (PPP) technology for self-navigation equipment is self-evident by delivering decimeter-/centimeter-level absolute position accuracy in a global coordinate framework. Nevertheless, the prolonged initialization period renders PPP almost too difficult to be widely used for time-critical applications in real transportation scenarios, for example, in city canyons and overpasses. We proposed a method to accomplish continuous decimeter-level positioning by leveraging triple-frequency GNSS observations with an Inertial Navigation System (INS) aiding in urban environments. In the proposed method, the inertial measurements and the original tri-frequency pseudorange and carrier phase measurements are tightly fused in an extended Kalman filter to obtain the optimal state estimate. Afterwards, with precise extra-wide-lane (EWL) and wide-lane (WL) Uncalibrated Phase Delay (UPD) products, the EWL and WL ambiguities can be resolved sequentially to implement instantaneous decimeter-level positioning. Exploiting the short-term high-precision characteristic of the INS, the continuity of the PPP solution can be ameliorated noticeably, and the ability of decimeter-level positioning can be maintained effortlessly throughout the navigation process. With land vehicle data collected, several experiments are undertaken to comprehensively assess the capability of the proposed system in urban scenarios, taking the solution obtained by a commercial post-processing software as the reference. The single-epoch decimeter-level position estimation can be captured instantaneously for WL ambiguity-fixed PPP solutions. Furthermore, for WL ambiguity-fixed PPP/INS-integrated solutions, the position estimation is better than 0.2 m for horizontal components and improved by 40-90% compared with that of the WL ambiguity-fixed PPP solutions. More importantly, the availability rate of positioning accuracy is better than 0.3 m in the horizontal direction and 0.5 m in the up direction reaching 93.91%, whereas it is only 53.78% for WL ambiguity-fixed PPP solutions. Overall, the WL ambiguity-fixed PPP/INS-integrated solutions have the favorable performance to maintain continuous decimeter-level positioning for self-navigation equipment, even if full GNSS outages are encountered.

AB Purpose Existing literature on algorithmic management practices - defined as autonomous data-driven decision making in people's management by adoption of self-learning algorithms and artificial intelligence - suggests complex relationships with employees' well-being in the workplace. While the use of algorithms can have positive impacts on people-related decisions, they may also adversely influence job autonomy, perceived justice and - as a result - workplace well-being. Literature review revealed a significant gap in empirical research on the nature and direction of these relationships. Therefore the purpose of this paper is to analyse how algorithmic management practices directly influence workplace well-being, as well as investigating its relationships with job autonomy and total rewards practices. Design/methodology/approach Conceptual model of relationships between algorithmic management practices, job autonomy, total rewards and workplace well-being has been formulated on the basis of literature review. Proposed model has been empirically verified through confirmatory analysis by means of structural equation modelling (SEM CFA) on a sample of 21,869 European organisations, using data collected by Eurofound and Cedefop in 2019, with the focus of investigating the direct and indirect influence of algorithmic management practices on workplace well-being. Findings This research confirmed a moderate, direct impact of application of algorithmic management practices on workplace well-being. More importantly the authors found out that this approach has an indirect influence, through negative impact on job autonomy and total rewards practices. The authors observed significant variation in the level of influence depending on the size of the organisation, with the decreasing impacts of algorithmic management on well-being and job autonomy for larger entities. Originality/value While the influence of algorithmic management on various workplace practices and effects is now widely discussed, the empirical evidence - especially for traditional work contexts, not only gig economy - is highly limited. The study fills this gap and suggests that algorithmic management - understood as an automated decision-making vehicle - might not always lead to better, well-being focused, people management in organisations. Academic studies and practical applications need to account for possible negative consequences of algorithmic management for the workplace well-being, by better reflecting complex nature of relationships between these variables.

TI Emergency end of life operations for CNES remote sensing
   satellites-Management and operational process
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
LA English
DT Article
DE Disposal operations; End of life; Reentry; Remote sensing satellites
AB The French Space Agency (CNES) is currently operating thirteen satellites among which five remote sensing satellites. This fleet is composed of two civilian (SPOT) and three military (HELIOS) satellites and it has been recently completed by the first PLEIADES satellite which is devoted to both civil and military purposes. The CNES operation board decided to appoint a Working Group (WG) in order to anticipate and tackle issues related to the emergency End Of Life (EOL) operations due to unexpected on-board events affecting the satellite. This is of particular interest in the context of the French Law on Space Operations (LSO), entered in force on Dec. 2010, which states that any satellite operator must demonstrate its capability to control the space vehicle whatever the mission phase from the launch up to the EOL. Indeed, after several years in orbit the satellites may be affected by on-board anomalies which could damage the implementation of EOL operations, i.e. orbital manoeuvres or platform disposal. Even if automatic recovery actions ensure autonomous reconfigurations on redundant equipment, i.e. setting for instance the satellite into a safe mode, it is crucial to anticipate the consequences of failures of every equipment and functions necessary for the EOL operations. For this purpose, the WG has focused on each potential anomaly by analysing: its emergency level, as well as the EOL operations potentially inhibited by the failure and the needs of on-board software workarounds ... The main contribution of the WG consisted in identifying a particular satellite configuration called "minimal Withdrawal From Service (WFS) configuration". This configuration corresponds to an operational status which involves a redundancy necessary for the EOL operations. Therefore as soon as a satellite reaches this state, a dedicated steering committee is activated and decides of the future of the satellite with respect to three options: a/. the satellite is considered safe and can continue its mission using the redundancy, b/. the EOL operations must be planned within a mid-term period, or c/. the EOL operations must be implemented as soon as possible by the operational teams. The paper describes this management and operational process illustrated with study cases of failures on SPOT and PLEIADES satellites corresponding to various emergency situations.

AB This paper reviews the design of the Tropical Pacific Observing System (TPOS) and its governance and takes a forward look at prospective change. The initial findings of the TPOS 2020 Project embrace new strategic approaches and technologies in a user-driven design and the variable focus of the Framework for Ocean Observing. User requirements arise from climate prediction and research, climate change and the climate record, and coupled modelingand data assimilation more generally. Requirements include focus on the upper ocean and air-sea interactions, sampling of diurnal variations, finer spatial scales and emerging demands related to biogeochemistry and ecosystems. One aim is to sample a diversity of climatic regimes in addition to the equatorial zone. The status and outlook for meeting the requirements of the design are discussed. This is accomplished through integrated and complementary capabilities of networks, including satellites, moorings, profiling floats and autonomous vehicles. Emerging technologies and methods are also discussed. The outlook highlights a few new foci of the design: biogeochemistry and ecosystems, low-latitude western boundary currents and the eastern Pacific. Low latitude western boundary currents are conduits of tropical-subtropical interactions, supplying waters of mid to high latitude origin to the western equatorial Pacific and into the Indonesian Throughflow. They are an essential part of the recharge/discharge of equatorial warm water volume at interannual timescales and play crucial roles in climate variability on regional and global scales. The tropical eastern Pacific, where extreme El Nino events develop, requires tailored approaches owing to the complex of processes at work there involving coastal upwelling, and equatorial cold tongue dynamics, the oxygen minimum zone and the seasonal double Intertropical Convergence Zone. A pilot program building on existing networks is envisaged, complemented by a process study of the East Pacific ITCZ/warmpool/cold tongue/stratus coupled system. The sustainability of TPOS depends on effective and strong collaborative partnerships and governance arrangements. Revisiting regional mechanisms and engaging new partners in the context of a planned and systematic design will ensure a multi-purpose, multi-faceted integrated approach that is sustainable and responsive to changing needs.

AB Rationale: There is increasing evidence that functional deficits in schizophrenia may be driven by a reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and consistent timing of neural signals. This study examined the extent to which exposure to the NMDA receptor antagonists ketamine and MK801, frequently used pharmacological models of schizophrenia, recreate deficits in electrophysiological markers of disturbed brain circuits that are thought to underlie the illness. Furthermore, this study characterizes the specificity of these differences across the frequency spectrum so as to help identify the nature of selective circuit abnormalities that mediate each oscillatory response as relevant to schizophrenia.
   Design: Mouse EEG was recorded during exposure to repeated auditory stimuli after injection of either vehicle or drug. The dose-response relationship for each electrophysiological measure was determined for ketamine and MK-801. Time-frequency analyses were performed to assess baseline, total, and evoked power and intertrial coherence (ITC) at low (5-10 Hz) and high (35-80 Hz)-frequencies.
   Results: High frequency evoked and total power was decreased by MK-801 and ketamine in a dose-dependent fashion. High frequency baseline power was increased by MK-801 and ketamine in a dose-dependent fashion. Similar to evoked power, high frequency inter-trial coherence was dose-dependently decreased by both drugs. Low frequency ITC was only decreased by ketamine.
   Conclusions: Both ketamine and MK-801 cause alterations in high-frequency baseline (noise), total (signal), and evoked (signal) power resulting in a loss of high frequency SNR that is thought to primarily reflect local circuit activity. These changes indicate an inappropriate increase in baseline activity, which can also be interpreted as non-task related activity. Ketamine induced a loss of intertrial coherence at low frequencies, indicating a loss of consistency in low-frequency circuit mechanisms. As a proportion of baseline power, both drugs had a relative shift from low to high frequencies, reflecting a change in the balance of brain activity from coordination of global regions to a pattern of discoordinated, autonomous local activity. These changes are consistent with a pattern of fragmented regional brain activity seen in schizophrenia. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown impressive performance in computer vision tasks; however, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks raises concerns regarding their security and reliability. Extensive research has shown that DNNs can be compromised by carefully crafted perturbations, leading to significant performance degradation in both digital and physical domains. Therefore, ensuring the security of DNN-based systems is crucial, particularly in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving, robotics, smart homes/cities, smart industries, video surveillance, and healthcare. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the current trends focusing specifically on physical adversarial attacks. We aim to provide a thorough understanding of the concept of physical adversarial attacks, analyzing their key characteristics and distinguishing features. Furthermore, we explore the specific requirements and challenges associated with executing attacks in the physical world. Our article delves into various physical adversarial attack methods, categorized according to their target tasks in different applications, including classification, detection, face recognition, semantic segmentation and depth estimation. We assess the performance of these attack methods in terms of their effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness. We examine how each technique strives to ensure the successful manipulation of DNNs while mitigating the risk of detection and withstanding real-world distortions. Lastly, we discuss the current challenges and outline potential future research directions in the field of physical adversarial attacks. We highlight the need for enhanced defense mechanisms, the exploration of novel attack strategies, the evaluation of attacks in different application domains, and the establishment of standardized benchmarks and evaluation criteria for physical adversarial attacks. Through this comprehensive survey, we aim to provide a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to gain a holistic understanding of physical adversarial attacks in computer vision and facilitate the development of robust and secure DNN-based systems.

AB One of the most relevant problems related to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle's (UAV) autonomous navigation for industrial inspection is localization or pose estimation relative to significant elements of the environment. This paper analyzes two different approaches in this regard, focusing on its application to unstructured scenarios where objects of considerable size are present, such as a truck, a wind tower, an airplane, a building, etc. The presented methods require a previously developed Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model of the main object to be inspected. The first approach is based on an occupancy map built from a horizontal projection of this CAD model and the Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL) algorithm to reach convergence by considering the likelihood field observation model between the 2D projection of 3D sensor data and the created map. The second approach uses a point cloud prior map of the 3D CAD model and a scan-matching algorithm based on the Iterative Closest Point Algorithm (ICP) and the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The presented approaches have been extensively evaluated using simulated as well as previously recorded real flight data. We focus on aircraft inspection as a test example, but our results and conclusions can be directly extended to other applications. To support this assertion, a truck inspection has been performed. Our tests reflected that creating a 2D or 3D map from a standard CAD model and using a 3D laser scan on the created maps can optimize the processing time, resources and improve robustness. The techniques used to segment unexpected objects in 2D maps improved the performance of AMCL. In addition, we showed that moving around locations with relevant geometry after take-off when running AMCL enabled faster convergence and high accuracy. Hence, it could be used as an initial position estimation method for other localization algorithms. The ICP-NL method works well in environments with elements other than the object to inspect, but it can provide better results if some techniques to segment the new objects are applied. Furthermore, the proposed ICP-NL scan-matching method together with UKF performed faster, in a more robust manner, than NDT. Moreover, it is not affected by flight height. However, ICP-NL error may still be too high for applications requiring increased accuracy.

AB High-resolution multibeam bathymetry and chirp (compressed high-density radar pulse) seismic data acquired from an autonomous underwater vehicle outline in unprecedented detail the shape and near subbottom character of the axial channels within upper Monterey and Soquel Canyons (offshore California, USA). In Monterey Canyon, the bathymetric data span water depths from 100 m to >2100 m, and include the confluence with Carmel Canyon at similar to 1900 m water depth. The bathymetric data for Soquel Canyon begin close to the canyon head at 100 m water depth and extend down to the intersection with Monterey Canyon. The seafloor within the axis of Monterey Canyon is covered with sediment fill out to 910 m water depth. Below this water depth exposures of underlying strata are common, presumably because of decreasing sediment drape and generally increased erosional resistance of the pre-canyon host strata. The seafloor within the axial channel of upper Soquel Canyon is smooth and contains horizontally layered sediment fill. In contrast, the sediment fill within the incised portions of the axial channel of Monterey Canyon is characterized by distinctive crescent-shaped bedforms down to the limit of the surveys. These differences in morphology and texture correspond with the contrasting cohesive strength of the sediments filling these canyons and the increased propensity for weakly cohesive sands and gravels in Monterey Canyon to fail. Episodic movement of coarse-grained sediments down Monterey Canyon maintains a longitudinal gradient of similar to 1.6 degrees. The more cohesive fine-grained sediments in Soquel Canyon stabilize the seafloor and maintain a substantially higher longitudinal gradient (3 degrees-6 degrees) than that measured in Monterey Canyon. The textural and lithologic data, plus previously published observations, indicate that upper Monterey Canyon is currently active, whereas upper Soquel Canyon appears to be inactive as a coarse sediment transport conduit. Episodic seabed sediment failures in active submarine canyons are hypothesized to control the gradient of the axial channel. The propensity for sediment failure in weakly cohesive coarse-grained sediments results in shallower horizontal gradients compared to submarine canyons stabilized by more cohesive fine-grained sediments.

AB The mid-ocean rift in the Red Sea is one of the youngest rifting systems on Earth. Only recently, state-of-the-art methods and modern deep-sea instruments have been used to explore this young and unique volcanic system. During the first autonomous underwater vehicle surveys of the Red Sea Rift in Spring 2022, we collected multibeam bathymetry, backscatter, sub-bottom profiler data, and water column data over a 9 km long ridge segment in the Hadarba Deep between 22.49 degrees N and 22.56 degrees N to investigate the volcano-tectonic processes of this ultra-slow spreading segment (12 mm/year spreading rate). The high-resolution hydroacoustic data was used to (1) delineate and quantify the geometry of tectonic structures and individual lava flows, (2) define lava flow morphology and eruption style, (3) estimate relative ages of flows and features, and (4) retrace the evolution of the volcanic activity. In addition, the geochemistry of several young lava flows provides information on the relation between the different magma that supply these eruptions. About 90 eruptive units with variable sedimentary cover have been identified within the 43 km(2) mapped region. The oldest lava flows are buried under 3 to 4.2 m of sediment, indicating ages of up to similar to 30 ka based on average sedimentation rate estimates (similar to 14 cm/ka), while the youngest eruptions are covered by<10 cm of sediment, and are thus younger than 700 years. Three volcanic phases have been identified based on changes in flow morphology and distribution, and tectonic pattern. All three axial phases have an average eruptive frequency of similar to 100-250 years. The segment displays an overall low tectonic extension (<10% of the total extension) and low vertical offset. Our geomorphological maps, analyses, and statistics reveal a moderately faulted, ultra-slow spreading MOR segment in the Red Sea with a surprisingly large amount of magmatic extension, implying that the segment has been underlined by a large magma supply for at least 15 ka. All these observations provide valuable implications for the formation history of the Red Sea Rift and the formation of ultra-slow spreading crust.

AB As a fundamental but difficult topic in computer vision, 3D object segmentation has various applications in medical image analysis, autonomous vehicles, robotics, virtual reality, lithium battery image analysis, etc. In the past, 3D segmentation was performed using hand-made features and design techniques, but these techniques could not generalize to vast amounts of data or reach acceptable accuracy. Deep learning techniques have lately emerged as the preferred method for 3D segmentation jobs as a result of their extraordinary performance in 2D computer vision. Our proposed method used a CNN-based architecture called 3D UNET, which is inspired by the famous 2D UNET that has been used to segment volumetric image data. To see the internal changes of composite materials, for instance, in a lithium battery image, it is necessary to see the flow of different materials and follow the directions analyzing the inside properties. In this paper, a combination of 3D UNET and VGG19 has been used to conduct a multiclass segmentation of publicly available sandstone datasets to analyze their microstructures using image data based on four different objects in the samples of volumetric data. In our image sample, there are a total of 448 2D images, which are then aggregated as one 3D volume to examine the 3D volumetric data. The solution involves the segmentation of each object in the volume data and further analysis of each object to find its average size, area percentage, total area, etc. The open-source image processing package IMAGEJ is used for further analysis of individual particles. In this study, it was demonstrated that convolutional neural networks can be trained to recognize sandstone microstructure traits with an accuracy of 96.78% and an IOU of 91.12%. According to our knowledge, many prior works have applied 3D UNET for segmentation, but very few papers extend it further to show the details of particles in the sample. The proposed solution offers a computational insight for real-time implementation and is discovered to be superior to the current state-of-the-art methods. The result has importance for the creation of an approximately similar model for the microstructural analysis of volumetric data.

TI Total nitrogen estimation in agricultural soils via aerial multispectral
   imaging and LIBS
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID CORN; MAIZE; COLOR; RATES
AB Measuring soil health indicators (SHIs), particularly soil total nitrogen (TN), is an important and challenging task that affects farmers' decisions on timing, placement, and quantity of fertilizers applied in the farms. Most existing methods to measure SHIs are in-lab wet chemistry or spectroscopy-based methods, which require significant human input and effort, time-consuming, costly, and are low-throughput in nature. To address this challenge, we develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven near real-time unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multispectral sensing solution (UMS) to estimate soil TN in an agricultural farm. TN is an important macro-nutrient or SHI that directly affects the crop health. Accurate prediction of soil TN can significantly increase crop yield through informed decision making on the timing of seed planting, and fertilizer quantity and timing. The ground-truth data required to train the AI approaches is generated via laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), which can be readily used to characterize soil samples, providing rapid chemical analysis of the samples and their constituents (e.g., nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, calcium). Although LIBS was previously applied for soil nutrient detection, there is no existing study on the integration of LIBS with UAV multispectral imaging and AI. We train two machine learning (ML) models including multi-layer perceptron regression and support vector regression to predict the soil nitrogen using a suite of data classes including multispectral characteristics of the soil and crops in red (R), near-infrared, and green (G) spectral bands, computed vegetation indices (NDVI), and environmental variables including air temperature and relative humidity (RH). To generate the ground-truth data or the training data for the machine learning models, we determine the N spectrum of the soil samples (collected from a farm) using LIBS and develop a calibration model using the correlation between actual TN of the soil samples and the maximum intensity of N spectrum. In addition, we extract the features from the multispectral images captured while the UAV follows an autonomous flight plan, at different growth stages of the crops. The ML model's performance is tested on a fixed configuration space for the hyper-parameters using various hyper-parameter optimization techniques at three different wavelengths of the N spectrum.

AB Animal propulsion systems are believed to show high energy and mechanical efficiency in assisting movement compared to artificial designs. As an example, batoid fishes have very light cartilaginous skeletons that facilitate their elegant swimming via enlarged wing-like pectoral fins. The aim of this work is to illustrate the hierarchical structure of the pectoral fin of a representative batoid, the Longnose Skate (Raja rhina), and explain the mechanical implications of its structural design. At the macro level, the pectoral fins are comprised of radially oriented fin rays, formed by staggered mineralized skeletal elements stacked end-to-end. At the micro level, the midsection of each radial element is composed of three mineralized components, which consist of discrete segments (tesserae) that are mineralized cartilage and embedded in unmineralized cartilage. The radial elements are wrapped with aligned, unmineralized collagen fibers. This is the first report of the detailed structure of the ray elements, including the observation of a 3-chain mineralized tesserae. Structural analyses demonstrate that this configuration enhances stiffness in multiple directions. A two-dimensional numerical model based on the morphological analysis demonstrated that the tessera structure helps distributing shear, tensile and compressive stress more ideally, which can better support both lift and thrust forces when swimming without losing flexibility.
   Statement of Significance
   Batoid fishes have very light cartilaginous skeletons that facilitate their elegant swimming by applying their enlarged wing-like pectoral fins. Previous studies have shown structural features and mechanical properties of the mineralized cartilage skeleton in various batoid fishes. However, the details of the pectoral fin structure at different length scales, as well as the relationship between the mechanical properties and structural design remains unknown. The present work illustrates the hierarchical structure of the pectoral fin of the Longnose Skate (a representative batoid fish) and verifies the materials configuration and structural design increases the stiffness of fin skeleton without a loss in flexibility. These results have implications for the design of strong but flexible materials and bio-inspired autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). (c) 2017 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID PROBE; MISSION
AB For more than 20 years, an "Interstellar Precursor Mission" has been discussed as a high-priority mission for multiple scientific objectives. The chief difficulty with actually carrying out such a mission is the need for reaching significant penetration into the interstellar medium (similar to1000 Astronomical Units (AU)) within the working lifetime of the initiators (<50 years). While there has been much speculation on various aspects of such a mission, we have systematically considered all of the components required, using realistic extrapolations of current and near-current technology. To provide a first-order cut at many of the engineering realities associated with such a mission, we consider a probe that can be launched with available vehicles and infrastructure. To implement the mission, we have revisited an old idea: the probe and a perihelion carrier are launched initially to Jupiter as a combined package and then fall to the Sun where a large propulsive maneuver propels the package on a high-energy, ballistic escape trajectory from the solar system. Outbound in deep space, the two separate, and the probe takes data with its onboard instruments and autonomously downlinks the data to Earth at regular intervals. The implementation requires a low-mass, highly-integrated spacecraft. Engineering issues separate into (1) the systems constraints imposed on the perihelion package by the combination of the propulsion system, carrying the needed propellant into perihelion, and the associated thermal and mechanical constraints, and (2) the requirements of power, autonomous operations, and data downlink from the probe itself. System trades define the minimum mass and power required for such a probe. We find that many of the requirements for a low-mass probe that operates autonomously for this mission are common for either this propulsion concept or more advanced low-thrust concepts, e.g., solar sails and ion propulsion. We describe an implementation, including science instrumentation and measurement goals, structure and thermal system, communications, avionics, propulsion, guidance and control, power, and architecture that could make such a mission into reality. We also describe some of the technology thrusts and developments that are required in order to begin such a mission in the next twenty-five years. (C) 2004 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Systematic surveys of the distribution of epibenthic megafaunal species relative to one another and to environmental variables in the deep sea can lead to inferences and testable hypotheses regarding factors that influence their distributions. Here we use a seascape approach to provide insight into the character and spatial extent of the influence of a chemosynthetic seep on the distribution of epibenthic megafauna and the nature of transition zones (ecotones). Faunal distributions were determined from georeferenced images of the seabed collected during a systematic survey (similar to 400 m x 400 m) by the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Sentry in the vicinity of a newly discovered methane bubble plume on the Blake Ridge Diapir. The survey area was found to include both seep and non-seep habitats. The sphere of influence of seep productivity on the surrounding benthic megafaunal assemblage was limited-on the order of 10's of meters-based on ecotone analysis. Small but detectable redox anomalies in the water column (5 m above bottom) in the study area occurred on a similar horizontal scale. Distributions of background megafaunal taxa were non-random for many morphotypes and included both positive and negative associations between morphotypes and the seep habitat. Subtle variations in depth (<6 m) correlated with distributions of seep-associated vesicomyid clams, which occupy shallow depressions in the seabed. The seep habitat itself, comprising a patchy mosaic of megafaunal sub-communities (e.g., clam bed, mussel bed, background soft-sediment bathyal taxa) and transition zones, was at least as diverse as the surrounding non-seep habitat and contributes seep endemic morphotypes to regional biodiversity. While seep productivity may support prey fields for deep-diving beaked whales, any relationship between the seeps and whale feeding areas remains intriguing speculation. Like many other regions of the deep sea, Blake Ridge South has accumulated marine litter, including litter likely originating from scientific endeavors. The suite of observations and analyses deployed here underscore the importance of seep habitats in enriching regional biodiversity, provide a glimpse of the non-random complexity of species distributions from a seascape perspective, and establish ecological baselines against which future studies may measure natural and anthropogenic changes in the seascape.

ID CO2 EMISSIONS
AB Environmental taxes are important means by which governments can address environmental pollution problems. Amid increasingly severe global warming, how should environmental taxes be used to better combat pollution and reduce emissions to promote sustainable socioeconomic development? This empirical analysis explores the influence of environmental taxes on CO2 emissions by utilizing a spatial Durbin model constructed with panel data from 2006 to 2020 encompassing 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities under the direct jurisdiction of China's central government. First, we found that a strong spatial auto-correlation exists be-tween carbon emission intensity and environmental taxes at the geographic and economic levels in each province. The characteristics of high-high and low-low agglomeration are consistent with the actual situation where each province has a strong regional correlation. Second, the estimation results of environmental taxes' spatial effect on carbon emissions show that under the neigh-boring space weight matrix, environmental taxes and fees can not only better promote regional carbon emission reduction but also reduce the carbon emissions of neighboring regions. Under the economic distance weight matrix, environmental taxes' impact on reducing carbon emission in-tensity in the province is not significant, but it can promote the reduction of carbon emissions in the economically neighboring provinces. Additionally, the results of the sub-tax estimation of environmental taxes and carbon emission intensity show that differences exist in the impacts of different environmental taxes on carbon emission intensity under different weight matrices. Among them, environmental protection, resource, vehicle and vessel, and urban land use taxes are basically unfavorable in reducing carbon emission intensity in a region and its neighboring regions, while urban maintenance and construction and cultivated land occupation taxes enhance carbon emission reduction. Our findings suggest that efficiently promoting carbon emissions reduction requires effectively utilizing the spatial effects of environmental taxes and carbon emissions, establishing and improving the regional carbon emissions reduction linkage mecha-nism, including carbon dioxide in the scope of taxation to further strengthen environmental taxes' positive impact on carbon emission reduction, and focusing on the heterogeneity of environ-mental tax implementation to achieve emission reduction goals.

TI Design of laser scanning binocular stereo vision imaging system and

DE Binocular stereo vision; Laser scanning; Image matching;
   Three-dimensional reconstruction
AB Binocular stereo vision is an important scheme of road environment perception for intelligent driving, because it can provide image information and spatial three-dimensional position infor-mation. However, binocular stereo matching is often disturbed by the environment, and noise, shadow, light transformation, and so on, will all cause mismatching, therefore it is impossible to carry out accurate 3D reconstruction. In this paper, an active imaging perception and target measurement method combining laser scanning and binocular vision is proposed. The binocular vision structure is used to simulate the human eye's observation of the environment in front of the vehicle. At the same time, through the laser lines scanned to the target, the strong characteristics of binocular matching are provided to enhance the anti-interference of binocular matching, and calculate the three-dimensional point cloud data of the front object according to the binocular stereo vision theory. Firstly, this paper studies the influence of the parameters changing of the system on the accuracy of object depth value in indoor environment, and then selects the most suitable system parameters to carry out three-dimensional reconstruction experiment on the actual target object in indoor environment. Finally, the scene experiment in outdoor environment is carried out. In the outdoor environment, the red spectrum laser equipped in the system can still effectively reconstruct the target surface radian, but there are some limitations due to the limi-tation of outdoor light intensity. This paper preliminarily summarizes the current structural design and experiment, and further discusses the follow-up research and improvement ideas. Research and experiments show that the laser scanning binocular stereo vision imaging system proposed in this paper has the function of forward target ranging, especially under some bad imaging environment, this method can also effectively match the binocular images, and present the three-dimensional information of the internal details of the target. Under the indoor exper-imental environment, the minimum relative error is 1.42 % for the target with a distance of about 1.5 m, and in the evening outdoor environment, the minimum the minimum relative error is 0.87 % for the target with a distance of about 3 m. Due to the advantages of laser line intensity feature matching, it can accelerate the speed of binocular matching, and has potential application prospects in autonomous system.

AB Carbon capture and storage in sub-seabed geological formations (sub-seabed CCS) is currently being studied as a realistic option to mitigate the accumulation of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere. In implementing sub-seabed CCS, detecting and monitoring the impact of the sequestered CO2 on the ocean environment is highly important. The first controlled CO2 release experiment, Quantifying and Monitoring Potential Ecosystem Impacts of Geological Carbon Storage (QICS), took place in Ardmucknish Bay, Oban, in May-September 2012.
   We applied the in situ pH/pCO(2) sensor to the QICS experiment for detection and monitoring of leaked CO2, and carried out several observations. The cabled real-time sensor was deployed close to the CO2 leakage (bubbling) area, and the fluctuations of in situ pH and pCO(2) above the seafloor were monitored in a land-based container. The long-term sensor was placed on seafloor in three different observation zones. The sediment pH sensor was inserted into the sediment at a depth of 50 cm beneath the seafloor near the CO2 leakage area. Wide-area mapping surveys of pH and pCO(2) in water column around the CO2 leakage area were carried out by using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) installed with sensors. Atmospheric CO2 above the leakage area was observed by using a CO2 analyzer that was attached to the bow of ship of 50 cm above the sea-surface.
   The behavior of the leaked CO2 is highly dependent on the tidal periodicity (low tide or high tide) during the CO2 gas release period. At low tide, the pH in sediment and overlying seawater decreased due to strong eruption of CO2 gas bubbles, and the CO2 ascended to sea-surface quickly with a little dissolution to seawater and dispersed into the atmosphere. On the other hand, the CO2 bubbles release was lower at high tide due to higher water pressure, and slight low pH seawater and high atmospheric CO2 were detected. After stopping CO2 gas injection, no remarkable variations of pH in sediment and overlying water column were observed for three months. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB ObjectiveAn integrated assessment framework that enables holistic safety evaluations addressing vulnerable road users (VRU) is introduced and applied in the current study. The developed method enables consideration of both active and passive safety measures and distributions of real-world crash scenario parameters.MethodsThe likelihood of a specific virtual testing scenario occurring in real life has been derived from accident databases scaled to European level. Based on pre-crash simulations, it is determined how likely it is that scenarios could be avoided by a specific Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) system. For the unavoidable cases, probabilities for specific collision scenarios are determined, and the injury risk for these is determined, subsequently, from in-crash simulations with the VIVA+ Human Body Models combined with the created metamodel for an average male and female model. The integrated assessment framework was applied for the holistic assessment of car-related pedestrian protection using a generic car model to assess the safety benefits of a generic AEB system combined with current passive safety structures.ResultsIn total, 61,914 virtual testing scenarios have been derived from the different car-pedestrian cases based on real-world crash scenario parameters. Considering the occurrence probability of the virtual testing scenarios, by implementing an AEB, a total crash risk reduction of 81.70% was achieved based on pre-crash simulations. It was shown that 50 in-crash simulations per load case are sufficient to create a metamodel for injury prediction. For the in-crash simulations with the generic vehicle, it was also shown that the injury risk can be reduced by implementing an AEB, as compared to the baseline scenarios. Moreover, as seen in the unavoidable cases, the injury risk for the average male and female is the same for brain injuries and femoral shaft fractures. The average male has a higher risk of skull fractures and fractures of more than three ribs compared to the average female. The average female has a higher risk of proximal femoral fractures than the average male.ConclusionsA novel methodology was developed which allows for movement away from the exclusive use of standard-load case assessments, thus helping to bridge the gap between active and passive safety evaluations.

AB Deep-sea fishes on seamounts have recently been shown to have strong changes in assemblage patterns with depth. However, horizontal variability patterns within a single seamount and among seamounts remain drastically understudied. The Papaha over bar naumokua over bar kea Marine National Monument (PMNM) is part of an extensive seamount chain that is relatively unimpacted by human activity as well as highly variable in physiographic and oceanographic characteristics. Three PMNM seamounts, Necker Island, French Frigate Shoals (FFS), and Pioneer Bank, were explored using Autonomous Underwater Vehicle surveys to document the deep-sea fish assemblages and their horizontal patterns of distribution at three different depths. Quantitative comparisons were made among the sides of the seamount and among the three seamounts while controlling for depth. The Gadiformes were the most abundant order with the highest number of individuals at 300 and 450 m on Pioneer and FFS. At 600 m the Myctophiformes showed the highest number of individuals overall and were the most abundant on FFS. Significant differences in abundance by seamount, side, and their interaction were observed at 300 and 600 m. Significant differences in some diversity metrics occurred in one, both, or the interaction of the factors of seamount and side at each depth. At all depths, the structure of the fish assemblage showed significant variation among seamounts and sides, which was explained mostly by the interaction term. After accounting for the variability explained by the confounding factor of time of day, the most common environmental factors related to assemblage structure for at least two depths were the east-west component of currents (u), latitude, chlorophyll a (chl a), and particulate organic carbon (POC). At 300 m, oxygen and salinity were also important, at 450 m mean direction of the substrate was an additional factor that was correlated with assemblage structure. At 600 m the factor that explained the most variation in community structure was percent rugosity. The results obtained in this study show significant horizontal variability in seamount fish assemblages within a given depth range; this variability should be taken into consideration in the management and conservation of the Monument and other seamounts.

AB Seafloor habitats on continental shelf margins are increasingly being the subject of worldwide conservation efforts to protect them from human activities due to their biological and economic value. Quantitative data on the epibenthic taxa which contributes to the biodiversity value of these continental shelf margins is vital for the effectiveness of these efforts, especially at the spatial resolution required to effectively manage these ecosystems. We quantified the diversity of morphotype classes on an outcropping reef system characteristic of the continental shelf margin in the Flinders Commonwealth Marine Reserve, southeastern Australia. The system is uniquely characterized by long linear outcropping ledge features in sedimentary bedrock that differ markedly from the surrounding low-profile, sand-inundated reefs. We characterize a reef system harboring rich morphotype classes, with a total of 55 morphotype classes identified from the still images captured by an autonomous underwater vehicle. The morphotype class Cnidaria/Bryzoa/Hydroid matrix dominated the assemblages recorded. Both alpha and beta diversity declined sharply with distance from nearest outcropping reef ledge feature. Patterns of the morphotype classes were characterized by (1) morphotype turnover at scales of 5 to 10s m from nearest outcropping reef ledge feature, (2) 30 % of morphotype classes were recorded only once (i.e. singletons), and (3) generally low levels of abundance (proportion cover) of the component morphotype class. This suggests that the assemblages in this region contain a considerable number of locally rare morphotype classes. This study highlights the particular importance of outcropping reef ledge features in this region, as they provide a refuge against sediment scouring and inundation common on the low profile reef that characterizes this region. As outcropping reef features, they represent a small fraction of overall reef habitat yet contain much of the epibenthic faunal diversity. This study has relevance to conservation planning for continental shelf habitats, as protecting a single, or few, areas of reef is unlikely to accurately represent the geomorphic diversity of cross-shelf habitats and the morphotype diversity that is associated with these features. Equally, when designing monitoring programs these spatially-discrete, but biologically rich outcropping reef ledge features should be considered as distinct components in stratified sampling designs.

AB Detailed exploration with remotely operated and autonomous deep submergence vehicles has revealed, at 9 degrees 33'S, the presence of the southernmost active hydrothermal field known so far on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The size of the hydrothermal field, which we have named "Lilliput", is about 1000 m x 250 m. It lies in a water depth of 1500 m on a ridge segment (Segment A3) with considerably thickened crust of 11 km. Four relatively small diffuse vent sites occur on a large young (estimated <100 years old) lava flow, partly covering the flow with hydrothermal Fe-oxide/hydroxide sediments. Based on homogeneous major element compositions of ca. 25 lava samples, this flow covers an area of at least 5 km x 0.6 km. The lava flow erupted from a series of parallel fissures at the western edge of the flow and a volcanic ridge consisting of up to 30 m high pillow mounds. The volcanic ridge probably represents the surface expression of an underlying dike which fed the flow. Several drained lava pond structures were observed within the flow but only one shows hydrothermal activity. The hydrothermal venting and precipitation of abundant Fe-oxyhydroxides appear to be related to the young diking and eruption event and the four different hydrothermally active sites of the Lilliput field lie along and almost equidistant from the eastern flank of the supposed dike. Although a hydrothermal plume some 500 m above the seafloor was found in two consecutive years (2005 and 2006), no high-temperature venting associated with Lilliput has been found. in agreement with findings at other ridges with thick crust such as Reykjanes. High magma supply rate and frequent diking and eruption events may lead to hot hydrothermal vents being rare in slow-spreading segments with thick crust whereas diffuse venting is abundant. Interestingly, the fauna at the Lilliput vents largely consists of small and apparently juvenile mussels (Bathymodiolus sp.) and did not show any signs of growth during the four years of continuing observations possibly reflecting pulsing hydrothermal activity.

ID IOT
AB The Internet of things (IoT) is the key enabler of the smart systems used in many areas, from agriculture to aviation, industrial automation to autonomous vehicles. Most IoT deployments employ cost-efficient lightweight devices with limited resources (e.g., bandwidth, energy, storage). Although an IoT network must be built in its simplest form, engineers include more sophisticated devices like gateways and servers to provide web-based services and benefit from cloud systems. So, although the nodes can be widely distributed geographically or topologically, the system becomes centralized, which causes bottlenecks and single-points-of-failure. Furthermore, providing data integrity, nonrepudiation, and event management becomes tricky. In most IoT scenarios, data usually flow from sensors to storage and processing units, whereas event-driven commands and triggers flow from these units to actuators, if any. Therefore, an attacker who gained access to parts of the centralized systems may leak, alter, or remove critical data and may exploit event handling features. This is where blockchain technology can be extremely useful. Using a decentralized ledger as the data storage unit provides integrity, immutability, and nonrepudiation for any IoT deployment. And a customized smart contract lets the IoT deployment benefit from decentralized and immutable (i.e. nonmanipulatable) event management features, too. Further, decentralization provides resilience against availability attacks to a large extent. With this motivation, we introduced a novel IoT architecture that incorporates an Ethereum-based private (Quorum) blockchain running a unique ad-hoc smart contract and a message queue telemetry transport (MQTT) based communication scheme between sensor and actuator nodes. The scheme, the ledger, and the smart contract have also been implemented with several nodes, a broker, and a server all on a PC using Docker containers, where the server was running a forest fire risk detection algorithm as the use case scenario. The proof-of-concept successfully validates the abovesaid functionality, scalability, and efficiency for the given IoT scenario (and some others). Moreover, performance tests showed that an instance of the system with 1000 nodes could stably process and record incoming (sensor) data up to 12.5 transactions per second (TPS) and distribute commands up to 4 TPS, whereas higher TPS is achievable depending on the network conditions and tolerance to losses. The scheme was shown to have polynomial message and time complexity.

AB This paper explores both random and class-based storage policies and three shuttle dispatching rules, random, distance-based, and demand-rate based, for a tier-to-tier shuttle-based storage and retrieval system (SBS/RS). Modeling the system as a discrete-time Markov Chain, this study derived the shuttle distribution under each policy combination, and further developed the expected travel time models for both single-command (SC) and dual-command (DC) operations. The developed models can help a warehouse designer or manager to comprehensively make four decisions for SBS/RS, whether SC or DC operations should be adopted, the most appropriate storage policy, the best shuttle dispatching rule, and the number of shuttles. The travel time models can evaluate each possible policy combination quickly through multiple criteria, such as the capacity, customer responsiveness, and costs of shuttles. Numerical experiments showed significant impacts of the policy combination on the expected travel time. Class-based storage, if implementable, is always better than random storage under each combination of shuttle dispatching rule and operational mode (i.e., SC or DC). Under random storage and SC operations, the distance-based shuttle dispatching rule is always better than the random rule, and their difference is concave in the number of shuttles. When classed-based storage is adopted and the number of shuttles is small, the demand-rate-based rule is the best under SC operations. Its benefit becomes more obvious when demand rates become more heterogeneous until some point but decreases as the system has more shuttles. Under DC Operations, depending on equipment speeds, the distance-based shuttle dispatching rule can be worse than the random rule under random storage. Under class-based storage and DC operations, the demand-rate-based rule is still the best when demand rates are heterogeneous. The differences between SC and DC operations are more significant when demand rates are more homogenous. When a system wants to be more responsive to customers, it should be run under SC operations. If the overall capacity is of interest, DC operations are much better.

AB Background Several studies highlight the effects of artificial intelligence (AI) systems on healthcare delivery. AI-based tools may improve prognosis, diagnostics, and care planning. It is believed that AI will be an integral part of healthcare services in the near future and will be incorporated into several aspects of clinical care. Thus, many technology companies and governmental projects have invested in producing AI-based clinical tools and medical applications. Patients can be one of the most important beneficiaries and users of AI-based applications whose perceptions may affect the widespread use of AI-based tools. Patients should be ensured that they will not be harmed by AI-based devices, and instead, they will be benefited by using AI technology for healthcare purposes. Although AI can enhance healthcare outcomes, possible dimensions of concerns and risks should be addressed before its integration with routine clinical care. Methods We develop a model mainly based on value perceptions due to the specificity of the healthcare field. This study aims at examining the perceived benefits and risks of AI medical devices with clinical decision support (CDS) features from consumers' perspectives. We use an online survey to collect data from 307 individuals in the United States. Results The proposed model identifies the sources of motivation and pressure for patients in the development of AI-based devices. The results show that technological, ethical (trust factors), and regulatory concerns significantly contribute to the perceived risks of using AI applications in healthcare. Of the three categories, technological concerns (i.e., performance and communication feature) are found to be the most significant predictors of risk beliefs. Conclusions This study sheds more light on factors affecting perceived risks and proposes some recommendations on how to practically reduce these concerns. The findings of this study provide implications for research and practice in the area of AI-based CDS. Regulatory agencies, in cooperation with healthcare institutions, should establish normative standard and evaluation guidelines for the implementation and use of AI in healthcare. Regular audits and ongoing monitoring and reporting systems can be used to continuously evaluate the safety, quality, transparency, and ethical factors of AI-based services.

AB 1. Associating fish sounds to specific species and behaviours is important for making passive acoustics a viable tool for monitoring fish. While recording fish sounds in tanks can sometimes be performed, many fish do not produce sounds in captivity. Consequently, there is a need to identify fish sounds in situ and characterise these sounds under a wide variety of behaviours and habitats. 2. We designed three portable audio--video platforms capable of identifying species-specific fish sounds in the wild: a large array, a mini array and a mobile array. The large and mini arrays are static autonomous platforms than can be deployed on the seafloor and record audio and video for one to two weeks. They use multichannel acoustic recorders and low--cost video cameras mounted on PVC frames. The mobile array also uses a multichannel acoustic recorder, but mounted on a remotely operated vehicle with built--in video, which allows remote control and real--time positioning in response to observed fish presence. For all arrays, fish sounds were localised in three dimensions and matched to the fish positions in the video data. We deployed these three platforms at four locations off British Columbia, Canada. 3. The large array provided the best localisation accuracy and, with its larger footprint, was well suited to habitats with a flat seafloor. The mini and mobile arrays had lower localisation accuracy but were easier to deploy, and well suited to rough/uneven seafloors. Using these arrays, we identified, for the first time, sounds from quillback rockfish Sebastes maliger, copper rockfish Sebastes caurinus and lingcod Ophiodon elongatus. In addition to measuring temporal and spectral characteristics of sounds for each species, we estimated mean source levels for lingcod and quillback rockfish sounds (115.4 and 113.5 dB re 1 mu Pa, respectively) and maximum detection ranges at two sites (between 10.5 and 33 m). 4. All proposed array designs successfully identified fish sounds in the wild and were adapted to various budget, logistical and habitat constraints. We include here building instructions and processing scripts to help users replicate this methodology, identify more fish sounds around the world and make passive acoustics a more viable way to monitor fish.

AB Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve is a shallow bay (< 30 m depth) on the island of O'ahu, Hawai'i, offshore of which tidal flow over deep ridge topography (500-1000 m depth) is known to generate semidiurnal frequency internal tides. A field experiment was conducted during March to June 2009 to determine whether the deep internal tides propagate shoreward to influence variability in temperature and currents in the bay environment. Temperature observations in the bay exhibit a diurnal cycle that is strongest near the surface (upper 10 m) and is associated with solar heating. In early summer (May June), as the upper mixed layer warms and a shallow seasonal thermocline develops, temperature fluctuations in deeper bay waters (> 15 m depth) become dominated by large semidiurnal variations (up to 2.7 degrees C) that are attributed to the internal tide. These temperature drops caused by the internal tide occur consistently twice a day under summer stratification at depths as shallow as 15 m, while smaller temperature drops (up to 1.8 degrees C) occur occasionally at 5 m. Although semidiurnal band temperatures vary seasonally, semidiurnal band currents exhibit similar magnitudes in spring and summer. This suggests that the weak temperature fluctuations in spring are due to the bay residing entirely in the upper mixed layer at this time of year, while internal tide energy continues to influence currents. Observations made along a cross-shore/vertical transect at the center of the bay with an autonomous underwater vehicle highlight the structure of cold intrusions that fill a large portion of the bay as well as the relationship between temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, and backscatter. Near-bottom, advective heat flux estimates at the mouth of the bay indicate that the internal tide tends to advect cold water into the bay primarily on the northeast side of the bay entrance, with cold water outflow on the opposite side. The observations highlight the role of the internal tide along with seasonal changes in stratification in temperature variability in shallow ecosystems, particularly those close to generation sites.

AB Some main activities have been developed as part of the HELINET research project which was financed in January 2000, by the European Commission, (Fifth Framework Program in the IST action), to develop a European project in the field of stratospheric platforms. From the aeronautical point of view the following items were studied: (1) the design of an autonomous high altitude long-endurance unmanned air vehicle (HALE-UAV) platform capable of remaining aloft for very long periods of time (between 6 and 9 months) using a solar-powered and fuel cell system and to gain a complete understanding of the feasibility of a near-term aerodynamic HALE concept, in particular as far as stratospheric platforms are concerned (mainly dependent on high efficiency and reliability of solar cells, fuel cells and electric motors), (2) an evaluation of the production and service costs and an assessment of the safety and regulatory aspects of the platform, and (3) the manufacturing of a scale-sized technological demonstrator and the execution of static tests on it up to the ultimate load. The first HELIPLAT (R) (HELIos PLATform) configuration was worked out, on the basis of a preliminary parametric study. The platform was a twin-boom tail type monoplane with eight brushless motors, a long horizontal stabilizer and two rudders. A scaled-prototype was designed to demonstrate the feasibility of this configuration and to perform some structural static and dynamic tests on it. The main CFRP structures were manufactured by CASA (Spain): the principal wing and horizontal tail tubular spars, booms, vertical tail spars and some reinforced ribs. These parts were delivered to the Aerospace Engineering Dept. (DIASP) at the Politecnico di Torino (POLITO) and assembled using special joints while some other necessary parts were manufactured by POLITO-DIASP. A parallel activity was performed to define the structural test configurations and structural test frame. The manufacturing activities and the development of the structural test system is described in the first part of the paper. Static and dynamic experimental tests were performed in two phases (2003 and 2004) on the prototype and the results of the static tests are presented in this paper and compared with numerical and theoretical computations.

AB Intelligent wireless networks that comprise self-organizing autonomous vehicles equipped with punctual sensors and radio modules support many hostile and harsh environment monitoring systems. This work's contribution shows the benefits of applying such networks to estimate clouds' boundaries created by hazardous toxic substances heavier than air when accidentally released into the atmosphere. The paper addresses issues concerning sensing networks' design, focussing on a computing scheme for online motion trajectory calculation and data exchange. A three-stage approach that incorporates three algorithms for sensing devices' displacement calculation in a collaborative network according to the current task, namely exploration and gas cloud detection, boundary detection and estimation, and tracking the evolving cloud, is presented. A network connectivity-maintaining virtual force mobility model is used to calculate subsequent sensor positions, and multi-hop communication is used for data exchange. The main focus is on the efficient tracking of the cloud boundary. The proposed sensing scheme is sensitive to crucial mobility model parameters. The paper presents five procedures for calculating the optimal values of these parameters. In contrast to widely used techniques, the presented approach to gas cloud monitoring does not calculate sensors' displacements based on exact values of gas concentration and concentration gradients. The sensor readings are reduced to two values: the gas concentration below or greater than the safe value. The utility and efficiency of the presented method were justified through extensive simulations, giving encouraging results. The test cases were carried out on several scenarios with regular and irregular shapes of clouds generated using a widely used box model that describes the heavy gas dispersion in the atmospheric air. The simulation results demonstrate that using only a rough measurement indicating that the threshold concentration value was exceeded can detect and efficiently track a gas cloud boundary. This makes the sensing system less sensitive to the quality of the gas concentration measurement. Thus, it can be easily used to detect real phenomena. Significant results are recommendations on selecting procedures for computing mobility model parameters while tracking clouds with different shapes and determining optimal values of these parameters in convex and nonconvex cloud boundaries.

AB Non-rigid moving multiple objects detection and tracking play an important role in intelligent video surveillance system, autonomous navigation, and activity analysis. Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) systems are deployed in numerous areas such as airports, traffic intersections, underground stations, mass events, mall, schools, and organisations for security and public surveillance. Although these cameras record continuous video 24x7, it is a human constraint to manually monitor all events such as crime, terrorism, hideous, suspicious activities, the positioning of the vehicle, and fire recorded from a number of cameras. Moreover, problems like dynamic background, the creation of ghost, sensor noise, varying illumination, and colour and compression artefacts affect effective detection of multiple moving objects. This study presents an effective approach named as enhanced Fractal Texture Analysis with KNN classifier (FTAKC) for tracking and detection of multiple objects from a video sequence. The proposed approach comprises three main phases, namely, detection of moving object, tracking of the object (enhanced Fractal Texture Analysis), and behaviour analysis for activity recognition (KNN classifier). The image feature has been extracted based on colour, texture, and geometry were used to identify and track multiple objects in video frames, and Problem domain knowledge rules were applied to distinguish normal or anomalous activities as well as behaviours. Edge detection algorithm (Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold to determine possible edge connections) was applied toward enhancing the illumination variation by multi-block Local Binary Pattern (LBP) temporal-analysis to do the segmentation. Finally, the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach has been estimated based on the measure of average PSNR, precision, recall, f-measure, accuracy, and execution time. The Laboratory for Image and Media Understanding (LIMU) dataset has been utilised toward illustrating the robustness of the proposed approach. Furthermore, it evaluated the performance based on the measure of precision, recall, and F-measure metrics. It has been tentatively demonstrated that the proposed approach is suitable for recognizing multiple moving object with detection accuracy up to 93.56%. The simulated results show that suggested approach is robust, flexible, as well as able to outperform the traditional methods than the present object detection method.

AB The rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy has been measured with airfoil probes mounted on an autonomous vehicle, Autosub, on constant-depth legs at 2-10 m below the surface in winds up to 14 m s(-1). The observations are mostly in an area limited by fetch to 26 km where the pycnocline depth is about 20 m. At the operational depths of 1.55-15.9 times the significant wave height H-s, and in steady winds of about 11.6 m s(-1) when the wave age is 11.7-17.2, dissipation is found to be lognormally distributed with a law-of-the-wall variation with depth and friction velocity. Breaking waves, leaving clouds of bubbles in the water, are detected ahead of the Autosub by a forward-pointing sidescan sonar, and the dissipation is measured when the clouds are subsequently reached. Bands of bubbles resulting from the presence of Langmuir circulation are identified by a semiobjective method that seeks continuity of band structure recognized by both forward- and sideways-pointing sidescan sonars. The times at which bands are crossed are determined and are used to relate dissipation rates and other measured parameters to the location of Langmuir bands. Shear-induced "temperature ramps'' are identified with large horizontal temperature gradients. The turbulence measurements are consequently related to breaking waves, the bubble clouds, Langmuir circulation, and temperature ramps, and therefore to the principal processes of mixing in the near-surface layer of the ocean, all of which are found to have associated patterns of turbulent dissipation rates. A large proportion of the highest values of dissipation rate occur within bubble clouds. Dissipation is enhanced in the convergence region of Langmuir circulation at depths to about 10 m, and on the colder, bubble containing, side of temperature ramps associated with water advected downward from near the surface. Near the sea surface, turbulence is dominated by the breaking waves; below a depth of about 6H(s) the local vertical mixing in stronger Langmuir circulation cells exceeds that produced on average by the shear-induced eddies that form temperature ramps.

ID BIASES; PHASE; MODEL
AB Differential GNSS (DGNSS) has been demonstrated to provide reliable, high-quality range correction information enabling real-time navigation with centimeter to sub-meter accuracy, which is required for applications such as connected and autonomous vehicles. However, DGNSS requires a local reference station near each user. For a continental or global scale implementation, this information dissemination approach would require a dense network of reference stations whose construction and maintenance would be prohibitively expensive. Precise Point Positioning (PPP) affords more flexibility as a public service for Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers, but its State Space Representation (SSR) format is not supported by most receivers in the field or on the market. This article proposes a novel Virtual Network DGNSS (VNDGNSS) approach and an optimization algorithm that is key to its implementation. The approach capitalizes on the existing PPP infrastructure without the need for new physical reference stations. Specifically, no reference station is needed in the local vicinity of any user. By connecting to public GNSS SSR data services, a VNDGNSS server maintains current information about satellite code bias, satellite orbit and clock, and atmospheric models. Construction of the Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services (RTCM) Observation Space Representation (OSR) messages from this SSR information requires both the signal time-of-transmission and the satellite position at that time which are consistent with the time-of-reception for each client. This article presents an algorithm to determine these quantities. Then the VNDGNSS computes and transmits RTCM OSR messages to user receivers. This approach achieves global dissemination coverage for real-time navigation without the need for additional local base stations near each user. The results of real-time stationary and moving platform evaluations are included, using u-blox M8P and ZED-F9P receivers. The performance surpasses the Society of Automotive Engineering (SAE) specification (68% of horizontal error <= 1.5 m and vertical error <= 3m) and shows significantly better horizontal performance than GNSS Open Service (OS).

AB In this study, a novel mobile robot that can throw precisely a stone in a curling match is introduced. This mobile robot plays alongside a human team. Several requirements for developing the mobile robot are defined so that it follows the game rules and operates on an ice field. A static force analysis considering the operating conditions of the mobile robot is conducted to derive the required motor torque and the optimal mechanical design. For a successful stone-throwing, the mobile robot must present a high driving performance on an ice surface with a target velocity and an angle provided by an autonomous strategy generator. To achieve the target velocity on an icy surface, a velocity control algorithm based on slip ratio control (SRC) is proposed. Moreover, to precisely achieve heading angle control, a heading angle controller including a steering angle disturbance observer (SA-DOB) is introduced. The mathematical model of the SA-DOB is derived by a dynamic analysis of the mobile robot. Several experimental results verify the proposed motion control algorithm and the feasibility of the mobile robot as a curling robot to compete with a human team. This study is motivated by the challenge of driving a mobile robot on an extremely slippery surface with high-accuracy motion for curling. To prevent slippage, a slip ratio controller is adopted based on the difference between the wheel and robot speeds. To maintain a desired heading angle of the mobile robot during driving, orientation control based on the yaw dynamics is developed. Moreover, the robot does not require any positioning information from external sources, such as sensors and cameras. In addition to playing an actual game, this curling robot can be utilized for training athletes. Furthermore, the developed algorithms for high-accuracy driving on ice in an indoor stadium can be applied to various mobile robots that drive on other slippery environments (such as sand and dust) and sealed spaces (such as underground warehouses) where external positioning signals cannot be received. The proposed robot is limited to straight driving, and the possibility of extending it to circular motion is still under development.

AB The stabilization and validation process of the measured position of objects is an important step for high-level perception functions and for the correct processing of sensory data. The goal of this process is to detect and handle inconsistencies between different sensor measurements, which result from the perception system. The aggregation of the detections from different sensors consists in the combination of the sensorial data in one common reference frame for each identified object, leading to the creation of a super-sensor. The result of the data aggregation may end up with errors such as false detections, misplaced object cuboids or an incorrect number of objects in the scene. The stabilization and validation process is focused on mitigating these problems. The current paper proposes four contributions for solving the stabilization and validation task, for autonomous vehicles, using the following sensors: trifocal camera, fisheye camera, long-range RADAR (Radio detection and ranging), and 4-layer and 16-layer LIDARs (Light Detection and Ranging). We propose two original data association methods used in the sensor fusion and tracking processes. The first data association algorithm is created for tracking LIDAR objects and combines multiple appearance and motion features in order to exploit the available information for road objects. The second novel data association algorithm is designed for trifocal camera objects and has the objective of finding measurement correspondences to sensor fused objects such that the super-sensor data are enriched by adding the semantic class information. The implemented trifocal object association solution uses a novel polar association scheme combined with a decision tree to find the best hypothesis-measurement correlations. Another contribution we propose for stabilizing object position and unpredictable behavior of road objects, provided by multiple types of complementary sensors, is the use of a fusion approach based on the Unscented Kalman Filter and a single-layer perceptron. The last novel contribution is related to the validation of the 3D object position, which is solved using a fuzzy logic technique combined with a semantic segmentation image. The proposed algorithms have a real-time performance, achieving a cumulative running time of 90 ms, and have been evaluated using ground truth data extracted from a high-precision GPS (global positioning system) with 2 cm accuracy, obtaining an average error of 0.8 m.

AB Coral reefs are exceptionally biodiverse and human dependence on their ecosystem services is high. Reefs experience significant direct and indirect anthropogenic pressures, and provide a sensitive indicator of coastal ocean health, climate change, and ocean acidification, with associated implications for society. Monitoring coral reef status and trends is essential to better inform science, management and policy, but the projected collapse of reef systems within a few decades makes the provision of accurate and actionable monitoring data urgent. The Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network has been the foundation for global reporting on coral reefs for two decades, and is entering into a new phase with improved operational and data standards incorporating the Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) (www.goosocean.org/eov) and Framework for Ocean Observing developed by the Global Ocean Observing System. Three EOVs provide a robust description of reef health: hard coral cover and composition, macro-algal canopy cover, and fish diversity and abundance. A data quality model based on comprehensive metadata has been designed to facilitate maximum global coverage of coral reef data, and tangible steps to track capacity building. Improved monitoring of events such as mass bleaching and disease outbreaks, citizen science, and socio-economic monitoring have the potential to greatly improve the relevance of monitoring to managers and stakeholders, and to address the complex and multi-dimensional interactions between reefs and people. A new generation of autonomous vehicles (underwater, surface, and aerial) and satellites are set to revolutionize and vastly expand our understanding of coral reefs. Promising approaches include Structure from Motion image processing, and acoustic techniques. Across all systems, curation of data in linked and open online databases, with an open data culture to maximize benefits from data integration, and empowering users to take action, are priorities. Action in the next decade will be essential to mitigate the impacts on coral reefs from warming temperatures, through local management and informing national and international obligations, particularly in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals, climate action, and the role of coral reefs as a global indicator. Mobilizing data to help drive the needed behavior change is a top priority for coral reef observing systems.

AB The purpose of this study was to further our understanding of the role of the coastal physical oceanographic environment as a dynamic and constantly evolving habitat for plankton. Over a 3-week period in the summer of 2010, an array of moorings were deployed and shipboard and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) surveys were conducted to investigate the association between physical processes and plankton distributions over the Monterey Bay, California inner shelf. Acoustic backscatter, chlorophyll-a fluorescence, and high-resolution zooplankton imagery data collected during the shipboard surveys were used to map the distributions of phytoplankton and zooplankton; and profiles of temperature, salinity, oxygen, and nitrate from the AUV characterized the physical and chemical environment. A synthesis of underway and moored time series data provided insight into the histories of water masses in the area, and facilitated tracking of internal wave groups as they propagated towards shore. A near-bottom intrusion of recently-upwelled water was found to be strongly influenced by the diurnal tide, resulting in daily across-shelf excursions past the mooring array at the 20-m isobath. Behind the leading edge of the intrusion, the water column was highly stratified in temperature, salinity, oxygen, and nitrate; and thin layers of phytoplankton and zooplankton persisted at the upper boundary of the intrusion. In ambient waters shoreward of the intrusion, stratification was weak; copepod, appendicularian, and gelatinous zooplankton abundances were relatively low; and phytoplankton and acoustic backscatter were broadly distributed throughout the lower half of the water column. The arrival of two shoreward-propagating internal wave groups observed during the shipboard survey corresponded with disparate responses in plankton distribution. In the wake of the first wave group, phytoplankton and zooplankton layers thinned or converged; in the wake of the second wave group, an eight-fold increase in gelatinous zooplankton was observed. These findings reveal a strong coupling between physical processes and the abundance and vertical distribution of plankton. It is necessary to understand the underlying physical environment in order to understand the complex distribution of organisms in the sea. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To operate unmanned systems in the ocean, many elements are required. They could be factors related to the equipment performance or operating methods. However, the aforementioned factors are suitable for situations not assuming unexpected events; in the actual ocean, unmanned equipment has the potential to experience problems in operation due to several factors such as environmental or external forces. Having problems in the propulsion system of unmanned marine equipment in unexpected situations affects the execution of duty of the unmanned equipment and connotes the risk of equipment damage and loss. Also, a lot of data generated in the real world is distributed disproportionately for each class, which means that the data of the minor class consists of significantly less data than the data of the majority class, and the normal data, in contrast, anomaly data is a very small amount of data, and there is very little data for learning. Therefore, in this study, anomaly detection based on unsupervised learning was conducted about these problems. In this study, we evaluated anomaly detection based on unsupervised learning to resolve these problems. Based on the results, the state of unmanned systems being operated in the ocean are identified and the anomaly state is examined. In this study, the auto-encoder (AE) method that learns the features of the normal area of the judgment data, that is, a part of machine learning, and the LSTM method for predicting time series states are utilized. This machine learning technology uses time-series learning data on the state of the unmanned system, creates standards to determine normal and anomaly states, and in turn, learns the normal state and determines the anomaly state. Furthermore, the simulation of the proposed method was carried out to verify the algorithm used in this study, and its validity was verified by comparing its data with the measured data. By applying the deduced anomaly detection information to the unmanned surface vehicle (USV) simulator, a fault tolerance control system was designed to enable the execution of duty even in the situation of an anomaly propeller of the USV, and the effectiveness of this study was verified.

AB Purpose Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have wide applications in surveillance and reconnaissance without risking human life. Due to unbalanced payload distribution or in-flight deployment, UAVs may undergo lateral center of gravity (c.g.) variations resulting in an asymmetric dynamic having significant longitudinal and lateral/directional coupling and hence more pronounced nonlinearity. Therefore, automatic control of UAVs becomes extremely difficult when it is forced to perform maneuvers under such imbalance in lateral mass distribution. The purpose of this paper is to design adaptive nonlinear control so that the UAV can perform some useful lateral/directional maneuver under lateral c.g. uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach First the nominal lateral/directional dynamics of a fixed-wing UAV is framed into strict feedback form and then the block backstepping approach is used to design the controller to execute horizontal turn and aileron roll maneuvers under no lateral c.g. variation. Thereafter, an adaptive block backstepping controller is designed to adapt to uncertainty in lateral c.g. position considering an approximate model of the asymmetric dynamics. The proposed adaptive scheme is validated against the same two maneuvers as considered for the nominal case. Findings First it is shown that the lateral/directional dynamics of a UAV can be converted to a block strict feedback form for executing some lateral/directional maneuvers. However, it was observed that the maneuver performance suffers significant performance degradation under lateral c.g. variations. To mitigate this issue, a simple and computationally inexpensive adaptive block backstepping scheme is proposed and validated. The adaptation law is further proved to be able to asymptotically estimate the actual c.g. location of the UAV. Practical implications The proposed control scheme allows the UAV to automatically adapt to lateral c.g. variations so that the intended maneuvers are performed without any noticeable loss in maneuver performance. Originality/value There are very few works available in the literature that address nonlinear control designs for executing specific lateral/directional maneuvers and, moreover, they consider symmetric UAVs or aircraft only. This paper addresses the practical problem of autonomous maneuvering for UAVs with unbalanced lateral mass distribution leading to shift of c.g. out of its plane of symmetry.

AB Collision avoidance and autonomous control of vehicles have become essential needs for providing a high-quality and safe life. This paper introduces a new generic scheme for a virtual antenna array (VAA) and its application in a train collision-avoidance system (TCAS). The proposed TCAS shall have the capability of identifying the range and angle of an object in front of a moving train and provide the required alerts. Thereby, a new virtual array distribution for both the transmitting and the receiving antenna arrays is introduced to get a long-range object detection and high-resolution multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system. This can be accomplished because the VAA radiation pattern is the multiplication of the radiation patterns for both the transmitting and receiving antenna arrays, which is different than each one of them alone. In this work, the VAA is utilized in radar systems in which the radar range depends on the multiplication of the gain of the transmitting and receiving antennas. So, we introduce a new scheme for the general design of VAA-based radars. A prototype for the antenna system was fixed on a of Texas Instruments platform for the cascading radar. One of the main problems of the VAA is the loss of radiated power in undesired directions, which affects the maximum detection range in beamforming systems and degrades the diversity gain in MIMO applications. These issues have been solved by the introduction of the practical implementation of a proposed high-gain, low side lobe level VAA system for automotive radar that is based on the integration of four AWR1243 RF chips operating in a frequency range of 76 GHz to 81 GHz. It was implemented using low-power 45 nm (TI) RFCMOS technology. The measured gain of the realized VAA was 47.2 dBi, which was 1.815 times higher than that of the Texas instrumentation linear frequency modulated continuous wave (TI' LFMCW) radar, which was 26 dBi. The proposed VAA saved 45% of the required implementation area compared to the TI' LFMCW antenna array. The VAA system was fabricated and tested in an anechoic chamber, and it was found that the simulated and measured patterns of the proposed VAA were highly matched in terms of half-power beamwidth and side lobe level.

DE Motion segmentation; Robot vision; Subspace clustering
ID TRACKING; OBJECTS
AB It is a well known result in the vision literature that the motion of independently moving objects viewed by an affine camera lie on affine subspaces of dimension four or less. As a result a large number of the recently proposed motion segmentation algorithms model the problem as one of clustering the trajectory data to its corresponding affine subspace. While these algorithms are elegant in formulation and achieve near perfect results on benchmark datasets, they fail to address certain very key real-world challenges, including perspective effects and motion degeneracies. Within a robotics and autonomous vehicle setting, the relative configuration of the robot and moving object will frequently be degenerate leading to a failure of subspace clustering algorithms. On the other hand, while gestalt-inspired motion similarity algorithms have been used for motion segmentation, in the moving camera case, they tend to over-segment or under-segment the scene based on their parameter values. In this paper we present a principled approach that incorporates the strengths of both approaches into a cohesive motion segmentation algorithm capable of dealing with the degenerate cases, where camera motion follows that of the moving object. We first generate a set of prospective motion models for the various moving and stationary objects in the video sequence by a RANSAC-like procedure. Then, we incorporate affine and long-term gestalt-inspired motion similarity constraints, into a multi-label Markov Random Field (MRF). Its inference leads to an over-segmentation, where each label belongs to a particular moving object or the background. This is followed by a model selection step where we merge clusters based on a novel motion coherence constraint, we call in-frame shear, that tracks the in-frame change in orientation and distance between the clusters, leading to the final segmentation. This oversegmentation is deliberate and necessary, allowing us to assess the relative motion between the motion models which we believe to be essential in dealing with degenerate motion scenarios.We present results on the Hopkins-155 benchmark motion segmentation dataset [27], as well as several on-road scenes where camera and object motion are near identical. We show that our algorithm is competitive with the state-of-the-art algorithms on [27] and exceeds them substantially on the more realistic on-road sequences.

AB Purpose - Technological advances regarding artificial intelligence (AI) are affecting the transport sector. Although fully autonomous delivery, or self-driving trucks, are not operating currently, various AI applications have become fixed components of cargo vehicles. Since many research approaches primarily concentrate on the technical aspects of assistance systems (ASs), the economic question of how to improve efficiency is seldom addressed. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to apply an efficiency analysis to measure the performance of truck drivers supplying retail stores.
   Design/methodology/approach - For this comparative study, 90 professional truck drivers in three groups are compared with (1) trucks without AS, (2) trucks with AS that cannot be turned off and (3) trucks with AS that can be turned off. First, we build a model investigating the impact of performance expectation, effort expectation, social influence and facilitating conditions on the behavioural intention to use AS. Second, we explore the impact of truck drivers' behavioural intention on actual technology use, misuse and disuse; operationalize these constructs; and merge them with our behavioural constructs to create one econometric model.
   Findings - The human-AI system was found to be the most efficient. Additionally, behavioural intention to use ASs did not lead to actual usage in the AI-alone observation group, but did in the human-AI group. Several in-depth analyses showed that the AI-alone group used AS at a higher level than the human-AI group, but manipulations through, for example, kickdowns or manual break operations led to conscious overriding of the cruise control system and, consequently, to higher diesel consumption, higher variable costs and lower efficiency of transport logistical operations.
   Research limitations/implications - Efficiency analysis with data envelopment analysis is, by design, limited by the applied input and output factors.
   Originality/value - This study represents one of the first quantitative efficiency analyses of the impact of digitalization on transport performance (i.e. truck driver efficiency). Furthermore, we build an econometric model combining behavioural aspects with actual technology usage in a real application scenario.

AB Ultra-high-resolution (1 m x 1 m x 0.25 m) bathymetry was acquired with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) over a sector of the Navy Fan offshore Baja California. The survey specifically targeted an area where the former interpretation of the fan showed a channel-lobe transition; however, the lobe and the transition were not recognized. Instead, the newly acquired bathymetry shows that the previously identified channel continues basinward changing its overall morphology and stratigraphic architecture, becoming gradually but significantly wider (650-1000 m) and of lower relief (3-4 m). Cores from the channel thalweg recovered mud-poor (<5%) well-sorted sands, interpreted as deposited by fully turbulent flows. The cores also show several mud-rich (9-18%) poorly sorted sands, probably indicating deposition from more cohesive flows.
   The high-resolution bathymetry shows large sectors of the seafloor sculpted by elaborate bedforms and scours. The overbank area north of the channel exhibits the most numerous and prominent scours, interpreted to have been largely generated by flow stripping at a bend in the channel. Along high-gradient sectors (more than approximately 1 degrees) of this area, the scours are largest and deepest. Some of these scours show an erosional headwall and a distal upflow-dipping depositional bulge, forming repetitive bedforms interpreted as erosional cyclic steps associated with locked-in-place trains of hydraulic jumps. The scours seem to coalesce to form an incipient channel, which would likely drive the avulsion of the main channel. Further basinward, average gradients decrease (<0.6 degrees) and scours become smaller and less deep suggesting a gradient control on erosion. The southern channel margin and adjacent overbank area exhibit a trend of scours that are elongated transverse to flow, that successively repeat themselves basinwards, and that at times merge with sediment waves. Probably these scours are genetically linked to sediment waves, and they may have been formed by cyclic-step-like processes as well. The acquired bathymetry represents a breakthrough in the imaging of the proximal sectors of deep-sea fans, which provides the basis for an accurate morphometric characterization and the understanding of sedimentary processes and morphodynamics associated with the delivery of sediment into the deep sea.

AB Behaviour-based models have been widely used to represent mobile robotic systems, which operate in uncertain dynamic environments and combine information from several sensory sources. The specification of complex mobile robotic applications is performed in such models by combining deliberative goal-oriented planning with reactive sensor driven operations. Consequently, the design of mobile robotic architectures requires the combination of time-constrained activities with deliberate time-consuming components. Furthermore, the temporal requirements of the reactive activities are variable and dependent on the environment (i.e. recognition processes) and/or on application parameters (i.e. process frequencies depend on robot speed).
   In this paper, a real-time mobile robotic architecture to cope with the functional and variable temporal characteristics of behaviour-based mobile robotic applications is proposed. Run-time flexibility is a main feature of the architecture that supports the variability of the temporal characteristics of the workload. The system has to be adapted to the environmental conditions, by adjusting robot control parameters (i.e. speed) or the system load (i.e. computational time), and take actions depending on it. This influence is focused on the ability of the system to select the appropriate activity to be executed depending on the available time, and. to change its behaviour depending on the environmental information. The flexibility of the system is allowed thanks to the definition of a real-time task model and the design of adaptation mechanisms for the regulation of the reactive load.
   The improvement of the robot quality of service (QoS) is another important aspect discussed in the paper. The architecture incorporates a quality of service manager (QoSM) that allows dynamically monitor analyse and improve the robot performances. Depending on the internal state, on the environment and on the objectives, the robot performance requirements vary (i.e. when the environment is overloaded, global map processes generating high-quality maps are required). The QoSM receives the performance requirements of the robot, and by adjusting the reactive load, the system enables the necessary slack time to schedule the more suitable deliberative processes and hence fulfilling the robot QoS. Moreover, the deliberative load can be scheduled by different heuristic strategies that provide answers of varying quality. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, their accuracy and reliability as a valid population technique have not been adequately tested. We tested the effectiveness of using a miniaturized thermal sensor equipped to a drone (thermal drone) for surveying white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations using a captive deer population with a highly constrained (hereafter, known) abundance (151-163 deer, midpoint 157 [87-94 deer/km(2), midpoint 90 deer/km(2)]) at Auburn University's deer research facility, Alabama, USA, 16-17 March 2017. We flew 3 flights beginning 30 minutes prior to sunrise and sunset (1 morning and 2 evening) consisting of 15 nonoverlapping parallel transects (18.8 km) using a small fixed-wing aircraft equipped with a nonradiometric thermal infrared imager. Deer were identified by 2 separate observers by their contrast against background thermal radiation and body shape. Our average thermal drone density estimate (69.8 deer/km(2), 95% CI = 52.2-87.6), was 78% of the mean known value of 90.2 deer/km(2), exceeding most sighting probabilities observed with thermal surveys conducted using human-occupied aircraft. Thermal contrast between animals and background was improved during evening flights and our drone-based density estimate (82.7 deer/km(2)) was 92% of the mean known value. This indicates that time of flight, in conjunction with local vegetation types, determines thermal contrast and influences ability to distinguish deer. The method provides the ability to perform accurate and reliable population surveys in a safe and cost-effective manner compared with traditional aerial surveys and is only expected to continue to improve as sensor technology and machine learning analytics continue to advance. Furthermore, the precise replicability of autonomous flights at future dates results in methodology with superior spatial precision that increases statistical power to detect population trends across surveys.

ID DESIGN
AB Underwater gliders are buoyancy propelled vehicle which make use of buoyancy for vertical movement and wings to propel the glider in forward direction. Autonomous underwater gliders are a patented technology and are manufactured and marketed by corporations. In this study, we validate the experimental lift and drag characteristics of a glider from the literature using Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. This approach is then used for the assessment of the steady state characteristics of a laboratory glider designed at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras. Flow behaviour and lift and drag force distribution at different angles of attack are studied for Reynolds numbers varying from 10(5) to 10(6) for NACA0012 wing configurations. The state variables of the glider are the velocity, gliding angle and angle of attack which are simulated by making use of the hydrodynamic drag and lift coefficients obtained from CFD. The effect of the variable buoyancy is examined in terms of the gliding angle, velocity and angle of attack. Laboratory model of glider is developed from the final design asserted by CFD. This model is used for determination of static and dynamic properties of an underwater glider which were validated against an equivalent CAD model and simulation results obtained from equations of motion of glider in vertical plane respectively. In the literature, only empirical approach has been adopted to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients of the AUG that are required for its trajectory simulation. In this work, a CFD approach has been proposed to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients and validated with experimental data. A two-mass variable buoyancy engine has been designed and implemented. The equations of motion for this two-mass engine have been obtained by modifying the single mass version of the equations described in the literature. The objectives of the present study are to understand the glider dynamics adopting a CFD approach, fabricate the glider and its variable buoyancy engine and test its trajectory in water and compare it with numerically obtained trajectory in the vertical plane.

TI Boils and turbulence in a weakly stratified shallow tidal sea
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY

DT Article
ID SURFACE; DISSIPATION; WAVES; LAYER; SKEWNESS; CURRENTS
AB Measurements of turbulence are made in a weakly but variably stratified region of tidal straining in the eastern Irish Sea using turbulence sensors profiling vertically through the water column on the Fast Light Yo-yo (FLY) profiler and horizontally on the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Autosub. The tidal currents exceed 1 m s(-1) at the location of the measurements in water of a depth of about 43.5 m, and result in turbulence extending from the seabed to the surface with a cycle period that is half that of the tides, as previously observed. The time of onset of enhanced turbulence that is measured by the sensors on FLY and Autosub as the speed of tidal currents increases are in good agreement, as are their mean levels. Boils on the sea surface are identified using the Autonomously Recording Inverted Echo Sounder, version 2 (ARIES II), a two-beam upward-pointing side-scan sonar mounted on a rig resting on the seabed. The boils have mean horizontal dimensions of about 25 m. They are continually present when turbulence within the water column near the surface is large, typically when the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass epsilon exceeds about 3 X 10 (-6) W kg(-1), compared to the rate of about 1 X 10(-7) W kg(-1) near times of slack tide when no boils are observed. The top of a region with a relatively high epsilon gradually extends upward from the seabed as the tidal flow increases and, in stably stratified conditions resulting from tidal straining during ebb tides, can be detected in the ARIES II sonographs as it approaches the sea surface, although only after sound reflection from the sea surface. Upward-moving bursts of enhanced turbulence below the surface with horizontal dimensions of about 5-9 m in the direction of the tidal flow are identified in the AUV record in periods of high tidal flow using conditional sampling. The bursts result in slight upward displacements of the AUV from its set operational depth. Boils first appear at times before the region of generally enhanced turbulence reaches the surface: large localized upward-moving bursts appear to precede the main advancing region of small-scale turbulence.

AB Collision warning systems can improve traffic safety, while their safety benefit may be lessened due to improper risk compensation or system misuse. There are limited studies of advanced safety systems increasing unexpected risky driving behavior, especially with adolescent drivers. This study is designed to address this research gap in two main areas: 1) it seeks to examine whether and how the introduction of advanced driver-assistance systems influences drivers' risk compensation behavior (e.g., increase of hard braking frequency), and 2) it investigates key factors (e.g., distraction) that contribute to changes in hard braking frequency during driving for both teen and adult drivers. Naturalistic driving data from two previous studies were analyzed in this study with two methods: a hierarchical logistic regression model was used to evaluate the effects of an integrated collision warning system on hard braking behavior, while a Random forests algorithm was applied to model hard braking behavior and to rank the contributing factors by calculating the importance scores. No statistical evidence was observed that the integrated collision warning system significantly changed the likelihood of hard braking for teen or adult drivers. Other factors like distraction, especially visual-manual distraction, had the largest impact on the hard braking behavior, followed by speeding and roadway segments (i.e., at intersections or not). Short time-headways and driving in high-density traffic significantly increased the likelihood of hard braking. Furthermore, the rate of hard braking behavior on surface roads was much higher than on highways, as expected. Compared with straight road segments, hard braking behavior was less likely to occur on curve roads. This study applied an analytical strategy by using both machine learning and statistical analysis methods to achieve high model accuracy and facilitate inference concerning the relationships among variables. Findings in this study can help to improve the design of integrated collision warning systems and the use of autonomous braking systems, and to apply appropriate analysis methods in understanding teen drivers' behavior changes with those safety systems.

AB The main drawback of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) is that almost their entire field of application is autonomous in terms of energy. Flights beyond 50 min are nearly impossible when using conventional energy storage systems (lithium-ion polymer or lithium-ion batteries). Several commercial products have been developed using hybrid systems (H-UAS). Although the improvement they have provided is undeniable, H-UAS in the present market are strongly limited by their low thrust vs. weight ratio, which is caused by limited electrical power generation and a non-optimal energy conversion with relatively low efficiencies. This paper reviews these systems to show the preliminary results of a prototype of hybrid generator which state-of-the-art electronics as well as a new approach using a supercapacitor (SC) array are used to save fuel, increase the thrust vs. weight ratio, optimize losses during conversion and prevent the overheating of the internal combustion unit (ICU). Whereas current generators mostly operate with the ICU at a constant speed, delivering maximum power, the presented prototype includes a throttle control system, and the engine works with a variable regime according to the power demand. Thus, fuel consumption is reduced, as well as heating and wear. The lifespan of the engine is also increased, and the time between maintenance operations is lengthened. The designed system provides almost twice the power of the hybrid current generators. The reduction in the RPM regime of the engine is achieved by means of a supercapacitor array that provides the necessary energy to keep the DC output power constant during the engine acceleration when the flight envelope experiences a perturbation or a sudden manoeuvre is performed by the pilot. To obtain maximum efficiency, the diode rectifiers and conventional converters used in the reviewed products are replaced by synchronous converters and rectifiers. The whole system is controlled by means of a FPGA where a specific control loop has been implemented for every device: ICU's throttle, DC bus converter, charge and discharge of the SC's array, cooling and monitoring of temperature for the cylinders heads, and on-line transmission, by means of a XBEE (TM) module, of all the monitored data to the flight ground station.

AB Trauma care systems in Spain are provided by the Nacional Health Service in a decentralized way by the seventeen autonomous communities whose process of decentralization was completed in January 2002. Its organisation is similar in all of them. Public sector companies of sanitary emergencies look after the health of citizens in relation to medical and trauma emergencies with a wide range of up to date resources both technical and human.
   In the following piece there is a description of the emergency response teams divided into ground and air that are responsible for the on site care of the patients in coordination with other public services. They also elaborate the prehospital clinical history that is going to be a valuable piece of information for the teams that receive the patient in the Emergency Hospital Unit (EHU).
   From 1980 to 1996 the mortality rate per 10,000 vehicles and the deaths per 1,000 accidents dropped significantly: in 1980 6.4 and 96.19% and in 1996, 2.8 and 64.06% respectively.
   In the intrahospital organisation there are two differentiated areas to receive trauma patients the casualty department and the EHU. In the EHU the severe and multiple injured patients are treated by the emergency hospital doctors; first in the triage or resuscitation areas and after when stabilised they are passed too the observation area or to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and from there the EHU or ICU doctors call the appropriate specialists. There is a close collaboration and coordination between the orthopaedic surgeon the EHU doctors and the other specialists surgeons in order to comply with treatment prioritization protocols. Once the patient has been transferred an entire process of assistance continuity is developed based on interdisciplinary teams formed in the hospital from the services areas involved in trauma assistance and usually coordinated by the ICU doctors.
   There is also mentioned the assistance registry of trauma patients, the ICU professional training in the ATLS and the future guidelines for trauma care in the ICU based on epidemiological studies carried out in both the North Spanish Group and the Southern one to promote development and improvement in several areas.

ID COLLISION-AVOIDANCE
AB Deep reinforcement learning, by taking advantage of neural networks, has made great strides in the continuous control of robots. However, in scenarios where multiple robots are required to collaborate with each other to accomplish a task, it is still challenging to build an efficient and scalable multi-agent control system due to increasing complexity. In this paper, we regard each unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with its manipulator as one agent, and leverage the power of multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) for the cooperative navigation and manipulation of a load. We propose solutions for addressing navigation to grasping point problem in targeted and flexible scenarios, and mainly focus on how to develop model-free policies for the UAVs without relying on a trajectory planner. To overcome the challenges of learning in scenarios with an increasing number of grasping points, we incorporate the demonstrations from an Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA) algorithm into our framework to guide the policy training and adapt two novel techniques into the architecture of MADDPG. Furthermore, curriculum learning with the attention mechanism is utilized by reusing knowledge from fewer grasping points to facilitate the training of a load with more points. Our experiments were validated by a load with three, four and six grasping points respectively in Coppeliasim simulator and then transferred into the real world with Crazyflie quadrotors. Our results show that the average tracking deviations from the desirable grasping point to the final position of the UAV can be less than 10 cm in some real-world experiments. Compared with state -of-the-art model-free reinforcement learning and swarm optimization algorithms, results show that our proposed methods outperform other baselines with a reasonable success rate especially in the scenarios with more grasping points. Furthermore, the learned optimal policies enable UAVs to reach and hover over all the grasping points before manipulation without any collision. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of both targeted and flexible navigation, highlighting their respective advantages and disadvantages.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The Internet of Things includes all connected objects from small embedded systems with low computational power and storage capacities to efficient ones, as well as moving objects like drones and autonomous vehicles. The concept of Internet of Everything expands upon this idea by adding people, data and processing. The adoption of such systems is exploding and becoming ever more significant, bringing with it questions related to the security and the privacy of these objects. A natural solution to data integrity, confidentiality and single point of failure vulnerability is the use of blockchains. Blockchains can be used as an immutable data layer for storing information, avoiding single point of failure vulnerability via decentralization and providing strong security and cryptographic tools for IoE. However, the adoption of blockchain technology in such heterogeneous systems containing light devices presents several challenges and practical issues that need to be overcome. Indeed, most of the solutions proposed to adapt blockchains to devices with low resources confront difficulty in maintaining decentralization or security. The most interesting are probably the Layer 2 solutions, which build offchain systems strongly connected to the blockchain. Among these, zk-rollup is a promising new generation of Layer 2/off-chain schemes that can remove the last obstacles to blockchain adoption in IoT, or more generally, in IoE. By increasing the scalability and enabling rule customization while preserving the same security as the Layer 1 blockchain, zk-rollups overcome restrictions on the use of blockchains for IoE. Despite their promises illustrated by recent systems proposed by startups and private companies, very few scientific publications explaining or applying this barely-known technology have been published, especially for non-financial systems. In this context, the objective of our paper is to fill this gap for IoE systems in two steps. We first propose a synthetic review of recent proposals to improve scalability including onchain (consensus, blockchain organization, horizontal ellipsis ) and offchain (sidechain, rollups) solutions and we demonstrate that zk-rollups are the most promising ones. In a second step, we focus on IoE by describing several interesting features (scalability, dynamicity, data management, horizontal ellipsis ) that are illustrated with various general IoE use cases.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a novel approach for trajectory tracking of UAVS. Research on unmanned aircraft is constantly improving the autonomous flight capabilities of these vehicles to provide performance needed to use them in even more complex tasks. The UAV path planner (PP) plans the best path to perform the mission. This is a waypoint sequence that is uploaded on the flight management system providing reference to the aircraft guidance, navigation and control system (GNCS). The UAV GNCS converts the waypoint sequence in guidance references for the flight control system (FCS) that, in turn, generates the command sequence needed to track the optimum path.
   Design/methodology/approach - A new guidance system (GS) is presented in this paper, based on the graph search algorithm kinematic A* (KA*). The GS is linked to a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) system that tracks the reference path, solving online (i.e. at each sampling time) a finite horizon (state horizon) open loop optimal control problem with genetic algorithm (GA). The GA finds the command sequence that minimizes the tracking error with respect to the reference path, driving the aircraft toward the desired trajectory. The same approach is also used to demonstrate the ability of the guidance laws to avoid the collision with static and dynamic obstacles.
   Findings - The tracking system proposed reflects the merits of NMPC, successfully accomplishing the task. As a matter of fact, good tracking performance is evidenced, and effective control actions provide smooth and safe paths, both in nominal and off-nominal conditions.
   Originality value - The GNCS presented in this paper reflects merits of the algorithms implemented in the GS and FCS. As a matter of fact, these two units work efficiently together providing fast and effective control to avoid obstacles in flight and go back to the desired path. KA* was developed from graph search algorithms. Maintaining their simplicity, but improving their search logics, it represents an interesting solution for online replanning. The results show that the GS uploads the collision avoidance path continuously during flight, and it obtains straightforward the reference variables for the FCS, thanks to the KA* model.

AB It has recently been shown that inner shelf waters of NE Monterey Bay, California function as an "extreme bloom incubator", frequently developing dense "red tide" blooms that can rapidly spread. Located within the California Current upwelling system, this open bay is strongly influenced by oceanographic dynamics resulting from cycles of upwelling favorable winds and their relaxation and/or reversal. Different wind forcing causes influx of different water types that originate outside the bay: cold nutrient-rich waters during upwelling and warm nutrient-poor waters during relaxation. In this study, we examine how the bay's bloom incubation area can interact with highly variable circulation to cause red tide spreading, dispersal and retention. This examination of processes is supported by satellite, airborne and in situ observations of a major dinoflagellate bloom during August and September of 2004. Remote sensing of high spatial, temporal and spectral resolution shows that the bloom originated in the NE bay, where it was highly concentrated in a narrow band along a thermal front. Upwelling circulation rapidly spread part of the bloom, mixing cool waters of an upwelling filament with warm bloom source waters as they spread. Vertical migration of the dinoflagellate populations was mapped by autonomous underwater vehicle surveys through the spreading bloom. Following bloom expansion, a two-day wind reversal forced intrusion of warm offshore waters that dispersed much of the bloom. Upwelling winds then resumed, and the bloom was further dispersed by an influx of cold water. Throughout these oceanographic responses to changing winds, an intense bloom persisted in sheltered waters of the NE bay, where extreme blooms are most frequent and intense. Microscopic examination of surface phytoplankton samples from the central bay showed that spreading of the bloom from the NE bay and mixing with regional water masses resulted in significantly increased abundance of dinoflagellates and decreased abundance of diatoms. Similar dinoflagellate bloom incubation sites are indicated in other areas of the California Current system and other coastal upwelling systems. Through frequent bloom development and along-coast transports, relatively small incubation sites may significantly influence larger regions of the coastal marine ecosystems in which they reside.

TI An automated image-based workflow for detecting megabenthic fauna in

AB Recent advances in optical underwater imaging technologies enable the acquisition of huge numbers of high-resolution seafloor images during scientific expeditions. While these images contain valuable information for non-invasive monitoring of megabenthic fauna, flora and the marine ecosystem, traditional labor-intensive manual approaches for analyzing them are neither feasible nor scalable. Therefore, machine learning has been proposed as a solution, but training the respective models still requires substantial manual annotation. Here, we present an automated image-based workflow for Megabenthic Fauna Detection with Faster R-CNN (FaunD-Fast). The workflow significantly reduces the required annotation effort by automating the detection of anomalous superpixels, which are regions in underwater images that have unusual properties relative to the background seafloor. The bounding box coordinates of the detected anomalous superpixels are proposed as a set of weak annotations, which are then assigned semantic morphotype labels and used to train a Faster R-CNN object detection model. We applied this workflow to example underwater images recorded during cruise SO268 to the German and Belgian contract areas for Manganese-nodule exploration, within the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ). A performance assessment of our FaunD-Fast model showed a mean average precision of 78.1% at an intersection-over-union threshold of 0.5, which is on a par with competing models that use costly-to-acquire annotations. In more detail, the analysis of the megafauna detection results revealed that ophiuroids and xenophyophores were among the most abundant morphotypes, accounting for 62% of all the detections within the surveyed area. Investigating the regional differences between the two contract areas further revealed that both megafaunal abundance and diversity was higher in the shallower German area, which might be explainable by the higher food availability in form of sinking organic material that decreases from east-to-west across the CCZ. Since these findings are consistent with studies based on conventional image-based methods, we conclude that our automated workflow significantly reduces the required human effort, while still providing accurate estimates of megafaunal abundance and their spatial distribution. The workflow is thus useful for a quick but objective generation of baseline information to enable monitoring of remote benthic ecosystems.

DE hierarchical reinforcement learning; cooperative multi-agent systems;

AB In this paper, we investigate the use of hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) to speed up the acquisition of cooperative multi-agent tasks. We introduce a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework, and propose a hierarchical multi-agent RL algorithm called Cooperative HRL. In this framework, agents are cooperative and homogeneous (use the same task decomposition). Learning is decentralized, with each agent learning three interrelated skills: how to perform each individual subtask, the order in which to carry them out, and how to coordinate with other agents. We define cooperative subtasks to be those subtasks in which coordination among agents significantly improves the performance of the overall task. Those levels of the hierarchy which include cooperative subtasks are called cooperation levels. A fundamental property of the proposed approach is that it allows agents to learn coordination faster by sharing information at the level of cooperative subtasks, rather than attempting to learn coordination at the level of primitive actions. We study the empirical performance of the Cooperative HRL algorithm using two testbeds: a simulated two-robot trash collection task, and a larger four-agent automated guided vehicle (AGV) scheduling problem. We compare the performance and speed of Cooperative HRL with other learning algorithms, as well as several well-known industrial AGV heuristics. We also address the issue of rational communication behavior among autonomous agents in this paper. The goal is for agents to learn both action and communication policies that together optimize the task given a communication cost. We extend the multi-agent HRL framework to include communication decisions and propose a cooperative multi-agent HRL algorithm called COM-Cooperative HRL. In this algorithm, we add a communication level to the hierarchical decomposition of the problem below each cooperation level. Before an agent makes a decision at a cooperative subtask, it decides if it is worthwhile to perform a communication action. A communication action has a certain cost and provides the agent with the actions selected by the other agents at a cooperation level. We demonstrate the efficiency of the COM-Cooperative HRL algorithm as well as the relation between the communication cost and the learned communication policy using a multi-agent taxi problem.

AB This article is the second of a three-part series in which we present the results of a study exploring concepts for improving communications and tracking capabilities of deep space SmallSats. In Part I, we discussed SmallSat direct-to-earth links and SmallSat communications equipment, and provided recommendations for future work. In Part II, we focus on SmallSat navigation options, Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN), proximity links, and the use of the communication link for science observations, and we provide recommendations for future work. We have examined both radio and optical navigation options, and considered autonomous and semiautonomous navigation to reduce operational costs for planetary SmallSats. We note that communication link resilience to delay and disruption enhances spacecraft autonomy; therefore, we have provided a discussion of DTN to indicate that using DTN allows for automated data transmission and recovery, therefore, reducing manual operations. SmallSats in deep space may utilize a relay spacecraft for communications with earth or function as a relay for landed and in-orbit assets. We present a detailed examination of relay proximity links and networks where we address both proximity hardware and networking scenarios. The proximity link features that we examine include the network architecture and its relationship to DTN, proximity radios and antennas, communications link performance, and proximity navigation. The use of the communication link for science has been practiced by primary missions in deep space scenarios. (Two examples of past planetary radio science experiments can be found in the following: https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/mission/spacecraft/cassini-orbiter/radio-science-subsystem/ and https://www.boulder.swri.edu/pkb/ssr/ssr-rex.pdf) Likewise, SmallSats can offer their radio links for radio science investigations. This article provides a brief introduction to radio science and presents the prerequisite features necessary for radio science observations by SmallSats. We conclude with nine recommendations based on the findings of the study. These recommendations are guidelines on the design, implementation, and operation of deep space SmallSat communication links. The adoption of some or all of the guidelines should result in an enhanced communication and tracking capability for the deep space SmallSat missions.

TI Forest Fire Segmentation via Temporal Transformer from Aerial Images

DT Article
DE fire segmentation; vision transformers; deep learning
ID NETWORK
AB Forest fires are among the most critical natural tragedies threatening forest lands and resources. The accurate and early detection of forest fires is essential to reduce losses and improve firefighting. Conventional firefighting techniques, based on ground inspection and limited by the field-of-view, lead to insufficient monitoring capabilities for large areas. Recently, due to their excellent flexibility and ability to cover large regions, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used to combat forest fire incidents. An essential step for an autonomous system that monitors fire situations is first to locate the fire in a video. State-of-the-art forest-fire segmentation methods based on vision transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use a single aerial image. Nevertheless, fire has an inconsistent scale and form, and small fires from long-distance cameras lack salient features, so accurate fire segmentation from a single image has been challenging. In addition, the techniques based on CNNs treat all image pixels equally and overlook global information, limiting their performance, while ViT-based methods suffer from high computational overhead. To address these issues, we proposed a spatiotemporal architecture called FFS-UNet, which exploited temporal information for forest-fire segmentation by combining a transformer into a modified lightweight UNet model. First, we extracted a keyframe and two reference frames using three different encoder paths in parallel to obtain shallow features and perform feature fusion. Then, we used a transformer to perform deep temporal-feature extraction, which enhanced the feature learning of the fire pixels and made the feature extraction more robust. Finally, we combined the shallow features of the keyframe for de-convolution in the decoder path via skip-connections to segment the fire. We evaluated empirical outcomes on the UAV-collected video and Corsican Fire datasets. The proposed FFS-UNet demonstrated enhanced performance with fewer parameters by achieving an F1-score of 95.1% and an IoU of 86.8% on the UAV-collected video, and an F1-score of 91.4% and an IoU of 84.8% on the Corsican Fire dataset, which were higher than previous forest fire techniques. Therefore, the suggested FFS-UNet model effectively resolved fire-monitoring issues with UAVs.

AB Deep-sea ecosystems, limited by their inability to use primary production as a source of carbon, rely on other sources to maintain life. Sedimentation of organic carbon into the deep sea has been previously studied, however, the high biomass of sedimented Sargassum algae discovered during the VEMA Transit expedition in 2014/2015 to the southern North Atlantic, and its potential as a regular carbon input, has been an underestimated phenomenon. To determine the potential for this carbon flux, a literature survey of previous studies that estimated the abundance of surface water Sargassum was conducted. We compared these estimates with quantitative analyses of sedimented Sargassum appearing on photos taken with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) directly above the abyssal sediment during the expedition. Organismal communities associated to Sargassum fluitans from surface waters were investigated and Sargassum samples collected from surface waters and the deep sea were biochemically analyzed (fatty acids, stable isotopes, C:N ratios) to determine degradation potential and the trophic significance within deep-sea communities. The estimated Sargassum biomass (fresh weight) in the deep sea (0.07-3.75 g/m(2)) was several times higher than that estimated from surface waters in the North Atlantic (0.024-0.84 g/m(2)). Biochemical analysis showed degradation of Sargassum occurring during sedimentation or in the deep sea, however, fatty acid and stable isotope analysis did not indicate direct trophic interactions between the algae and benthic organisms. Thus, it is assumed that components of the deep-sea microbial food web form an important link between the macroalgae and larger benthic organisms. Evaluation of the epifauna showed a diverse nano- micro-, meio, and macrofauna on surface Sargassum and maybe transported across the Atlantic, but we had no evidence for a vertical exchange of fauna components. The large-scale sedimentation of Sargassum forms an important trophic link between surface and benthic production and has to be further considered in the future as a regular carbon input to the deep-sea floor in the North Atlantic.

AB Similar to most visual animals, the crab Neohelice granulata relies predominantly on visual information to escape from predators, to track prey and for selecting mates. It, therefore, needs specialized neurons to process visual information and determine the spatial location of looming objects. In the crab Neohelice granulata, the Monostratified Lobula Giant type1 (MLG1) neurons have been found to manifest looming sensitivity with finely tuned capabilities of encoding spatial location information. MLG1s neuronal ensemble can not only perceive the location of a looming stimulus, but are also thought to be able to influence the direction of movement continuously, for example, escaping from a threatening, looming target in relation to its position. Such specific characteristics make the MLG1s unique compared to normal looming detection neurons in invertebrates which can not localize spatial looming. Modeling the MLG1s ensemble is not only critical for elucidating the mechanisms underlying the functionality of such neural circuits, but also important for developing new autonomous, efficient, directionally reactive collision avoidance systems for robots and vehicles. However, little computational modeling has been done for implementing looming spatial localization analogous to the specific functionality of MLG1s ensemble. To bridge this gap, we propose a model of MLG1s and their pre-synaptic visual neural network to detect the spatial location of looming objects. The model consists of 16 homogeneous sectors arranged in a circular field inspired by the natural arrangement of 16 MLG1s' receptive fields to encode and convey spatial information concerning looming objects with dynamic expanding edges in different locations of the visual field. Responses of the proposed model to systematic real-world visual stimuli match many of the biological characteristics of MLG1 neurons. The systematic experiments demonstrate that our proposed MLG1s model works effectively and robustly to perceive and localize looming information, which could be a promising candidate for intelligent machines interacting within dynamic environments free of collision. This study also sheds light upon a new type of neuromorphic visual sensor strategy that can extract looming objects with locational information in a quick and reliable manner.

AB It has been observed that driver behavior has a direct and considerable impact upon factors like fuel consumption, environmentally harmful emissions, and public safety, making it a key consideration of further research in order to monitor and control such related hazards. This has fueled our decision to conduct a study in order to arrive at an efficient way of analyzing the various parameters of driver behavior and find ways and means of positively impacting such behavior. It has been ascertained that such behavioral patterns can significantly impact the analysis of traffic-related conditions and outcomes. In such cases, the specific vehicular behavior can be detected and related data mined in order to analyze the spatial or temporal patterns of movement patterns as well as to position/track the prominent trends. This analysis seeks to determine the efficacy of such an exercise and whether the various parameters employed can help efficiently determine the various criteria for defining the driver's style. To that end, the analysis of a driver's behavioral pattern and performance utilizes a computer modeled application for generating a set of classifications based on the autonomous driving data as well as indicators that are characteristic of driver aggression. In order to draw such insights from the driver's behavior, the application is modeled using various categories of data, for instance, the steering wheel's angle, braking conditions, acceleration conditions, the vehicle speed, etc Unlike the previously developed mechanisms for analyzing the system-based driver behavioral patterns, which were not very efficacious, this endeavor assimilates the contemporary breakthroughs in real-world scenario analysis approaches and driver behavior classification methods. Based on the system capabilities and desired outcomes, distinct strategies can be employed in order to detect the target driver's behavior. In this specific case, neural network algorithms were utilized in order to conduct an intensive study to determine and analyze the prevailing driver behavior and driving styles. This proposed approach evaluated multiple factors that were determinants in identifying specific driver behavior and driving styles. The results of this experiment that utilized Python, indicated that the driver model in question was successful in achieving a 90% accuracy in terms of logistic regression.

AB Currently, developments in wireless sensing technologies have shown that wireless signals can be employed to transmit information between wireless communication devices and are also able to realize passive target wireless sensing. Wireless sensing has diverse Internet-of-Things applications in indoor human detection, such as in device-free localization, activity recognition and fall detection, respiration detection, gait recognition, user identification, and so forth. Deep learning (DL), with the latest breakthroughs in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), seems to be a feasible technique for device-free wireless sensing (DFWS) and human detection in a more intelligent and autonomous manner. Although DL has attracted wide spread attention in computer vision (CV), AI games, speech recognition, automated vehicles, and other fields, its application in wireless sensing systems (WSSs) is relatively new, and little attention has been paid to it. Motivated by these developments, this article clarifies the motivation and mechanism of the DL-aided WSSs for human detection. First, we survey the most advanced architecture of DL that may be powerful for WSSs. We also review conventional ML and DL approaches to human detection based on red green blue (RGB)/depth camera and radar: one reason is to introduce the successful experience in these areas to the field of wireless sensing and another reason is that the possibility of combining and fusing information from the heterogeneous types of sensors is expected to improve the overall performance of practical human detection systems. We provide a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art research on wireless sensing for human detection with a focus on WSSs. Furthermore, a general structure of the DL-based WSS is introduced in detail for hitherto unexplored applications and future wireless sensing scenarios. We also discuss some open research issues in wireless sensing for human detection, including data acquisition for DL model training, calibration of signals from commercial devices, multimodal sensing, simultaneous user identification and activity recognition, multiuser human detection, and generalization ability of DL models, to indicate future research directions.

AB Industry 4.0 has paved the way for a world where smart factories will automate and upgrade many processes through the use of some of the latest emerging technologies. One of such technologies is Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which have evolved a great deal in the last years in terms of technology (e.g., control units, sensors, UAV frames) and have significantly reduced their cost. UAVs can help industry in automatable and tedious tasks, like the ones performed on a regular basis for determining the inventory and for preserving item traceability. In such tasks, especially when it comes from untrusted third parties, it is essential to determine whether the collected information is valid or true. Likewise, ensuring data trustworthiness is a key issue in order to leverage Big Data analytics to supply chain efficiency and effectiveness. In such a case, blockchain, another Industry 4.0 technology that has become very popular in other fields like finance, has the potential to provide a higher level of transparency, security, trust and efficiency in the supply chain and enable the use of smart contracts. Thus, in this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a UAV-based system aimed at automating inventory tasks and keeping the traceability of industrial items attached to Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags. To confront current shortcomings, such a system is developed under a versatile, modular and scalable architecture aimed to reinforce cyber security and decentralization while fostering external audits and big data analytics. Therefore, the system uses a blockchain and a distributed ledger to store certain inventory data collected by UAVs, validate them, ensure their trustworthiness and make them available to the interested parties. In order to show the performance of the proposed system, different tests were performed in a real industrial warehouse, concluding that the system is able to obtain the inventory data really fast in comparison to traditional manual tasks, while being also able to estimate the position of the items when hovering over them thanks to their tag's signal strength. In addition, the performance of the proposed blockchain-based architecture was evaluated in different scenarios.

AB In this paper, the distributed consensus problem for a class of multiple Euler-Lagrange systems is solved. The considered issues are: 1) sampled-data information; 2) transmission delay; and 3) data packet dropouts. The considered mathematical models can describe a large number of practical systems in the actual engineering. In particular, all of the information exchanges are modeled by a sample-and-hold mechanism, which is more reliable and practical in applications. Moreover, this framework can deal with time-varying transmission delays and data packet dropouts by taking into account the limited communication capacity of information exchanges. By utilizing model transformation and applying the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method, sufficient conditions are first established with single-packet information exchanges to ensure that the networked Euler-Lagrange systems can achieve consensus under undirected communication topology. Then, the obtained results are further extended to the multiple-packet transmission case. Finally, an example of four two-link manipulators with time-varying transmission delays and data packet dropouts is addressed to verify the effectiveness and applicability of our theoretical results.
   Note to Practitioners-The motivation of this paper is to investigate a practical networking strategy for the cooperative control of multiple Euler-Lagrange systems that have been widely applied in modeling robotic manipulators, autonomous underwater vehicles, and spacecrafts. Existing approaches are mainly based on the continuous-time communication network, which are difficult to be implemented in the real-world applications. In addition, energy consumption problems for multi-agent systems have received increasing attention in recent years, which also motivate us to carry out the present study. Since continuous-time communications inevitably consume much energy, how to find an effective way to reduce energy cost is an urgent task. Therefore, this paper presents a novel method for communications among multiple Euler-Lagrange systems based on the sampled-data information, where discrete-time communications are used instead of continuous-time communications. Another advantage of the proposed method is that it can significantly reduce the transmission energy consumption. Furthermore, both transmission delays and data packet dropouts are taken into account which make our results more applicable in practice.

AB An acoustic survey using sub-bottom sonar (SBS) and Autonomous Underwater Vehicle EcoMapper (AUVEM) combined with coring was used for the investigation of bottom topography, thickness of the sediments, and geodynamic factors influencing the postglacial deposition in Tatra Mts. lakes. This combined study of seven lakes shows four basic acoustic units and four subunits that are interpreted in terms of stratigraphy and lithology.
   However, the presence of particular acoustic units may not be encountered in all the lakes due to the effects of local and internal lake processes. Thick horizontal reflections with high amplitude reflectors characterize the bedrock or the infill with a thickness of more than 6 m. Chaotic internal reflection configuration and high amplitude reflectors are common and reflect the glacigene deposits of unknown thickness in the bottom of the lakes. Above the signals of glacigene sediments lie reflections with weak to moderate amplitude reflectors, and with a parallel and chaotic configuration. They correspond to the glaciolacustrine laminated clay and silt and postglacial gyttja that contain clastic outwash from various mass movement deposits. The transition zone between these two SBS reflections is formed by a discontinuous, parallel and wavy configuration with the acoustic bottom. This type of signal is interpreted as a mixture of cobbles, boulders, and fine-grained sediments.
   The exact lithological content and the presence of the acoustic units are determined by other factors that may not be visible around the lakes and can cause stratigraphic hiatuses. As a prominent and un-recognized factor in the Tatra Mts. until now is the presence of the bottom springs (pockmarks) of the non-karstic origin, which effectively disturb the fine clastic and organic matter deposition and hence can limit the use of the lake deposit for palaeoclimatic and palaeoecological studies. The mass movement processes - debris flow, rockfall - forming the mountain geo-relief are frequent and their products are visible in the marginal facies. The sonar inspection also provides evidence of mass movement deposits, which have no indication on the terrestrial environment and thereby represent intralacustrine landslides as a result of bedrock instability due to the late Pleistocene deglaciation or Holocene climatic variability.

AB OC26 (R/V Oceanus Site 26) is one of three primary sites selected for study by the Ecosystem Impact of Oil and Gas Inputs to the Gulf (ECOGIG) consortium to determine the impacts of natural seepage versus large pulse inputs of hydrocarbons into the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and to chart the long-term effects and mechanisms of ecosystem recovery from the Deep Water Horizon Oil Spill in 2010. OC26 is located on the western slope of the Gloria Dome, about five kilometers south-east of the Macondo wellhead. In 2011, the site was visited by the NOAA research vessel Okeanos Explorer. During this cruise, several natural oil/gas plumes originating from the seabed were identified. In order to establish precise locations for these naturally occurring sources of hydrocarbons and to inform biogeochemical and biological studies of the water-column, the seafloor, and the shallow subseafloor in the wake of the Deep Water Horizon spill, we conducted several Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) surveys. The surveys were designed to include swath bathymetry, chirp sub-bottom profiles, and seafloor still photos to augment the Okeanos Explorer and the 2012 ECOGIG Falkor multibeam bathymetric and water column data. These AUV high resolution datasets were collected to provide in-depth geophysical analyses of seafloor morphology and to link, where possible, morphological features to the subsurface structure and plumbing system at this site where natural seepage possibly intersects hydrocarbon inputs from the spill. The site exhibits many morphological seafloor features: depressions, elongated erosional structures, dome-shaped mud volcanoes/mounds, fault traces, and round pockmarks. Seabed photos show the presence of gas hydrate outcrops and benthic communities in the vicinity of maximum seafloor backscatter intensities and many of the morphological features. Subsurface profiles show gas-related anomalies (blanking and acoustic wipeout) where pockmarks, mud volcanoes/mounds and depressions are located. In addition to the discovery of novel seafloor features, these studies provide definitive links between seafloor seeps and particular morphologies and communities, contributing to the fundamental understanding of seeps in the deep sea.

TI A Hybrid Controller Enhancing Transient Performance for an Aerial

ID ROBOT
AB Autonomous aerial manipulation requires the capability to handle inevitable dynamic changes during physical interaction. Previously, very few studies have addressed the stability and transient performance of the scenarios involving abrupt changes in dynamics. This paper proposes a hybrid controller enhancing transient performance for an aerial manipulator extracting an object wedged in a static structure. This task incurs a significant jump in the interaction force on the end-effector so that the analysis using the concept of hybrid dynamical systems is required. To demonstrate the dynamic characteristics of the object-extracting aerial manipulator, we derive the dynamic equations for two flight modes, i.e., free-flight and object-extracting, and the rule of state jumps. Also, we design control strategies which enhance the transient performance during flight mode transition. Then, the stability of the proposed control law is proven, and the overshoot reduction after the object extraction is analyzed. To show the improved performance, we conduct plug-pulling experiments with a quadrotor-based aerial manipulator using the proposed controller and two different existing controllers. The comparative results confirm that our controller enables the aerial manipulator to maintain its stability after the flight mode transition and shows the best transient performance in overshoot minimization among three controllers.
   Note to Practitioners-The motivation for this article is the desire to prevent unexpected collisions between obstacles and an aerial manipulator after the vehicle extracts a wedged object from a static structure. To resolve this problem, we present a hybrid control method for such tasks while avoiding an excessive overshoot after the extraction. This method can be utilized in tasks involving abrupt changes in the dynamic model such as retrieving a device attached to a tall structure, reclaiming an object in disaster recovery, or pulling a plug out of a socket. Unlike existing methods, the proposed method simultaneously considers the stability and the initial overshoot right after pulling the object out of the structure, by employing a disturbance observer (DOB) in a hybrid control structure. It can be utilized for the aerial manipulator to avoid collision in a narrow space or to keep it in a safe operation envelope even though the task requires producing a relatively large pulling force.

AB Image sensing has entered a new era with advancements in quantum mechanics. The infrared (IR) absorbers are the heart of this new era of image sensing. Within the IR spectra, the shortwave to mid-wave (MWIR) radiations are absorbed by IR photodetectors, whereas the MWIR to very-long wave spectrum is absorbed by IR thermal detectors. Both of these categories of image sensing cover the complete IR spectrum utilized by the applications ranging from biosensing in healthcare sector to autonomous vehicle navigation in military and space purposes. Despite having high-cost semiconductor technology with group-II-VI (mercury-cadmium- telluride) and group-III-V (indium-gallium-arsenide) dominating this IR absorbance industry for many decades, the need to have a cost-effective solution has led to an explosion in the exploration of potential materials. Two-dimensional (graphene, dichalcogenides of transition metals, and black-phosphorous) antimonite-based and group-IV/IV alloys have been found to show unprecedented absorption yield and detector properties comparable to traditional dominators with flexible fabrication methods. At the same time, the photon upconversion phenomenon that upconverts low-energy light to high-energy light has emerged as an exceptionally rich area of research in image sensing. The principle behind this concept lies in different energy transfer mechanisms (two photon absorption, triplet-triplet annihilation, cooperative energy pooling, etc.). The advancements that took place most recently in the development of IR absorbers have been reviewed in a concise way. Furthermore, the advancements in upconversion-based detection focusing on how this is evolving as a low-cost alternative for image sensing have been reviewed. Further discussion on how to anticipate a low-power, cost-effective, and light-weight image sensing system has been presented while mentioning some recent research as a proof-of-concept. We finally suggest a possible approach that could come up by synergizing the two simultaneous technologies to foresee the realization of an all-optical, low-power, and light-weight broad-range IR absorber for various applications.

AB We computationally study thrust generation and propulsive characteristics of an elastic plate pitching and/or heaving in free stream laminar flow. The pitching is considered about the leading edge, and the Reynolds number based on the plate length and free stream velocity is 150. An in-house fluid-structure interaction (FSI) solver is employed to simulate the large-scale flow-induced deformation of the structure along with active pitching and heaving in two-dimensional coordinates. The FSI solver utilizes a partitioned approach to strongly couple a sharp-interface immersed boundary method based flow solver with an open-source finite-element structural dynamics solver. We elucidate the mechanism of the thrust generation in the rigid and elastic plate by comparing the time-variation of thrust and work done by the plate, together with the wake signatures in the downstream. The time variation of the thrust is explained using first-order scaling arguments. The computed thrust as a function of pitching frequency for the rigid pitching plate shows a similar trend as compared to the published data of rigid foils, while the elastic plate exhibits a strong influence of the flow-induced deformation of the plate. They both exhibit reverse von Karman-like vortex shedding in the downstream. We quantify the differences in propulsive characteristics of these two plate types as a function of pitching frequency. We found that there lies an optimum pitching frequency for the elastic plate for efficient propulsion, while the rigid one outperforms the elastic plate at larger pitching frequency. This is due to the fact that the elastic plate locks in to a higher mode of vibration at a larger pitching frequency. Furthermore, the influence of mass ratio, flexural rigidity, pitching amplitude, and Reynolds number on the performance of the elastic plate is also investigated. Finally, we study the combined effect of pitching and heaving on the propulsive performance. The pitching frequency for the maximum efficiency is lesser for the combined heaving and pitching plate as compared to only heaving or only pitching. Our results provide fundamental insights into the propulsive characteristics of the elastic pitching and/or heaving plates, which could help design autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB Introduction: Cracks are a key feature that determines the structural integrity of rocks, and their angular distribution can be used to determine the local or regional stress patterns. The temporal growth of cracks can be monitored in order to predict impending failures of materials or structures such as a weakened dam. Thus, cracks and their spatial-temporal distributions should be automatically monitored for assessing their structural integrity, the associated stress patterns and their potential for failure.Method: We show that the U-Net convolutional neural network, semantic segmentation and transfer learning can be used to accurately detect cracks in drone photos of sedimentary massifs. In this case, the crack distributions are used to assess the safest areas for tunnel excavation. Compared to the coarse performance of ridge detection, the U-Net accuracy in identifying cracks in images can be as high as 98% when evaluated against human identification, which is sufficient for assessing the general crack properties of the rock faces for the engineering project.Result: Based on approximately 100 h of manual cracks labeling in 127 drone photos and 20 h of network training, the U-Net was able to successfully detect cracks in 23,845 high-resolution photographs in less than 22 h using two Nvidia V100 GPUs. Meanwhile, the network was able to detect more than 80% of the observable cracks of a volcanic outcrop in Idaho without additional training. With a modest amount of extra labeling on photos of the volcanic outcrop and transfer training, we found that the accuracy significantly improved. The surprising outcome of this research is that the U-Net crack detector laboriously trained on photos of sedimentary rocks can also be effectively applied to photos of volcanic rock faces. This can be important for real-time assessment of geological hazards and lithology information for dam inspection and planetary exploration by autonomous vehicles. For another application, we accurately detected fractures and faults with a scale of tens of kilometers from Martian photographs.Conclusions: In summary, our methodology of using CNN with transfer training suggests that it can be used as a semi-universal detector of cracks in across a range of diverse geological settings.

AB In this paper, we address pursuit-evasion problems in which the pursuer is a Differential Drive Robot (DDR) that attempts to capture an omnidirectional evader. From the Nash property it follows that if the evader deviates from its maximum potential speed then the capture time shall not increase for a pursuer that does not deviate from its Nash equilibrium motion strategy. However, it is not immediately clear how the pursuer could exploit that evader's deviation from its maximum potential speed, which might correspond to situations where the evader's capabilities may degrade with time, for example, battery depletion in an autonomous vehicle, or fatigue in an animal evader. This can be considered as a scenario of an evader in which the set of admissible controls varies with time. In the present paper we consider such scenario. In our first result, we propose an alternative strategy for the pursuer, which, for certain scenarios, further reduces the capture time compared to the strategy based on the maximum potential evader's speed. In our second result, we show that, under non-anticipative strategies, a pursuer strategy that uses the instantaneous evader speed alone, does not always guarantee to improve the payoff for the pursuer, nor the capture of the evader. Hence, we conclude that the evader's location is the relevant information for the pursuer to know. Later, we present vision-based control laws that implement the optimal pursuer strategy. The optimal pursuer strategy is characterized by a partition of the reduced space (a representation of the game in the pursuer's body-attached coordinate system) in which each region maps to an optimal pursuer action. We consider the case for which the pursuer is equipped with an omnidirectional catadioptric camera. Finally, in our third result we show that the location of the evader on the image can be directly used by the pursuer to define its motion strategy, in spite of the distortion of the state space suffered on the image. That is, the pursuer is able to apply its motion strategy using the image without explicitly reconstructing the evader's position. This approach is computationally efficient, and robust to occlusions and noise in the image. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI MODELLING ACOUSTIC TRANSMISSION LOSS DUE TO SEA ICE COVER
SO ACOUSTICS AUSTRALIA
LA English
DT Article
ID WAVE-SCATTERING; SOUND; PROPAGATION; REFLECTION; UNDERSIDE; SPEED; WATER
AB The propagation of underwater acoustic signals in polar regions is dominated by an upward refracting sound speed environment and the presence of a dynamic highly variable ice canopy. This paper provides an overview of the acoustic properties of sea ice and assesses the influence of ice canopy and water column properties on acoustic transmission loss for propagation within 20 km of a sound source at 20 m depth. The influence of the ice canopy is assessed first as a perfectly flat surface, and then as a statistically rough surface. A Monte Carlo method is used for the inclusion of ice deformation and roughness. This involves the creation of sets of synthetic ice profiles based on a given sea ice thickness distribution, followed by statistical methods for combining the output of individually evaluated ice realisations. The experimental situation being considered in the framing of this problem is that of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) operating within 50 m of the surface. This scenario is associated with a frequency band of interest of 942 kHz and a horizontal range of interest up to 20 km. The situation has been evaluated for a set of typical ice statistics using Ray and Beam acoustic propagation techniques. The sound speed profile (based on real data) results in a strong defocussing of direct path signals at ranges from 9-20 km and depths shallower than 50 m. This reduction in the signal strength of the direct path creates areas where the influence of surface reflected paths becomes significant. The inclusion of a perfectly flat ice layer reduces the transmission loss between 9-20 km by 15-50 dB. When the ice layer is included as a rough surface layer the results show a boost to signal strength of up to 8 dB in the small areas of maximum defocussing. Sea ice is a strongly time and space varying sea surface and exists in areas where defocussing of the direct path due to the sound speed profile reduces the range of direct path dominated transmission. This work presents methods for including a statistically relevant rough surface through a technique for generation of sets of surfaces based on ice deformation statistics. It outlines methods for including ice in acoustic modelling tools and demonstrates the influence of one set of ice statistics on transmission loss.

AB This paper presents the results of an investigation into attitudes towards and willingness to fly in pilotless aircraft (PAs) among a sample of 711 UK people known to fly at least occasionally. A problem with past studies in the area is that attitudes have only been measured explicitly, using questionnaire items drawn from literature in the field. Also, distinctions between attitude strength and attitude structure have not been considered. The present investigation employed an implicit measure of attitudes and examined attitudes via (i) a structural topic modelling procedure (in order to measure the structure of attitudes within the sample) and (ii) an Implicit Association Test (to evaluate attitude strength). Outcomes to the Implicit Association Test contributed significantly and substantially to the explanation of the sample members' degrees of willingness to fly in PAs. These are important matters considering the need for airlines, government agencies and aircraft manufacturers to induce public acceptance of PAs. Determinants of attitudes were posited to include self-image congruence, fear of flying, general anxiety syndrome, interest in new technologies, age, gender, and exposure to information about pilotless aircraft. A model containing these variables was assembled and estimated, the results providing a good fit (R-2 = 0.58) with data obtained from the sample. Three primary components of attitude emerged from the investigation: risk, excitement and innovation. Four variables exerted the greatest effects on attitude structure, namely selfcongruence, interest in new technologies, prior knowledge of PAs, and the age of the participant. Fear of flying and generalised anxiety impacted on the risk element of attitude structure, but not on excitement, innovation or attitude strength. Neither the fear of flying variable nor generalised anxiety had significant influences on attitude strength, although they did have significantly negative effects on willingness to fly in a pilotless airplane. Thirty-one per cent of the sample members disagreed or strongly disagreed with a question (five-point scale) asking whether a person was willing to fly in a pilotless aircraft. The results of the study have important implications for public information campaigns initiated by state agencies and for the marketing activities and promotional messages of airlines that will need to seek public acceptance of pilotless aircraft.

AB This article proposes a set of novel attitude estimation algorithms for a bioinspired integrated navigation system including an insect-inspired polarization sensor, an inertial measurement unit, and a global navigation satellite system (GNSS). In particular, the biomimetic polarization sensor introduced as the new type of navigation component has an orientation performance comparable to that of a magnetometer. Moreover, this small and light sensor is immune to magnetic interference, making it highly suitable for orientation in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, inaccurate modeling, unknown parameters, and unknown statistical characteristics of noise are common problems with the orientation solution of the sensor. Therefore, we theoretically compare various adaptive and robust filtering algorithms, select the best error prediction covariance and noise covariance correction schemes, introduce Kalman smoothers and approximate inference methods, and then propose two outlier-robust algorithms. This approach can suppress multiple outliers from the two steps of prediction and estimation. The polarization sensor and GNSS update the state and error covariance according to the asynchronous fusion mode. The prediction error covariance, the polarization measurement noise covariance, and the GNSS measurement noise covariance are approximately estimated by the variational inference method. To validate the performance of our algorithms, we collected a set of multi-rotor UAV flight data for testing. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms have better robustness performance than existing state-of-the-art algorithms. Note to Practitioners-This article was motivated by Bioinspired autonomous navigation systems suffering from inaccurate modeling, unknown parameters, and noise with unknown statistical properties. Subject to the large uncertainty in the flight of the UAV, the traditional filtering algorithm has slow convergence or even divergence when processing such actual data. In this article, we first establish a unified state estimation framework. Then, we mathematically describe correction strategies for prediction error covariance and measurement noise covariance. Considering the need for real-time estimation, we adopted the extended Kalman filter. However, this introduces a truncation error, then, Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoothing is introduced to improve the linearized reference point. However, the role of robust filtering is limited, and the non-Gaussian state still exists. Finally, the approximate inference method is used to estimate the state. The proposed method integrates adaptability, robustness, reasoning, and smoothing, and is suitable for dealing with multi-source interference problems in multi-source information fusion.

AB The advent of new cloud-based applications such as mixed reality, online gaming, autonomous driving, and healthcare has introduced infrastructure management challenges to the underlying service network. Multi-access edge computing (MEC) extends the cloud computing paradigm and leverages servers near end-users at the network edge to provide a cloud-like environment. The optimum placement of services on edge servers plays a crucial role in the performance of such service-based applications. Dynamic service placement problem addresses the adaptive configuration of application services at edge servers to facilitate end-users and those devices that need to offload computation tasks. While reported approaches in the literature shed light on this problem from a particular perspective, a panoramic study of this problem reveals the research gaps in the big picture. This paper introduces the dynamic service placement problem and outline its relations with other problems such as task scheduling, resource management, and caching at the edge. We also present a systematic literature review of existing dynamic service placement methods for MEC environments from networking, middleware, applications, and evaluation perspectives. In the first step, we review different MEC architectures and their enabling technologies from a networking point of view. We also introduce different cache deployment solutions in network architectures and discuss their design considerations. The second step investigates dynamic service placement methods from a middleware viewpoint. We review different service packaging technologies and discuss their trade-offs. We also survey the methods and identify eight research directions that researchers follow. Our study categorises the research objectives into six main classes, proposing a taxonomy of design objectives for the dynamic service placement problem. We also investigate the reported methods and devise a solutions taxonomy comprising six criteria. In the third step, we concentrate on the application layer and introduce the applications that can take advantage of dynamic service placement. The fourth step investigates evaluation environments used to validate the solutions, including simulators and testbeds. We introduce real-world datasets such as edge server locations, mobility traces, and service requests used to evaluate the methods. We compile a list of open issues and challenges categorised by various viewpoints in the last step.

AB Human factor-related accidents account for an increasing portion of the total accidents through the advancing level of system automation. Human reliability becomes the key issue in human -machine systems especially for safety-relevant tasks and operations. Rasmussen's SRK (skill-rule -knowledge) model is well known in the field of human factors. Likewise, it is well known that skill-based behaviors have the highest human reliability, while knowledge-based behaviors are associated with the lowest reliability scores. Although numerous studies exist on human error probability (HEP), correspondingly typically attributed directly or indirectly to these three levels of behavior, a coherent, consistent representation, especially using data sources, has not been available. In this contribution, the quantification of human behavior levels with Rasmussen's SRK model is given based on three databases for the first time. Effects of time pressure and training on human reliability switching are also analyzed based on related publications. To determine the HEP of these three levels, three databases, technique for human error rate prediction (THERP), Savannah river site human reliability analysis (SRS-HRA) and nuclear action reliability assessment (NARA), from human reliability analysis (HRA) methods are used. The procedure contains identifying the tasks including the operator involved and the assumptions the analysts made and classifying the tasks into suitable cognitive behavior mode (CBM). In this case, the relationship between SRK levels and HEP is mapped. The effects of the two in automation context very relevant performance shaping factors (PSFs), time pressure and training/knowledge degradation, on human behavior levels switching are analyzed and the explanations of the SRK switching are presented. In this case, a more general structure is established to illustrate the dynamic behavior of levels switching with six directions under different conditions. From the results we conclude that skill, rule, and knowledge behavior levels are continuous in terms of HEP and therefore allow a new inside into this key aspect of human factor quantification. Based on this analysis the consequences of daily automation in the context of autonomous transport systems in combination with human qualification and reliability degrading are from this specific and in the current automation discussion very intensively discussed. The presented discussion linking SRK levels and HEP gives a new perspective on the foreseeable consequences of further automation in application areas with increasing automation of everyday tasks (like using a highly automated vehicle).

AB Monterey Bay and contiguous waters of the California Current System have been observed repeatedly since 1929, most intensively since 1989 with ships, moorings, and autonomous vehicles. Here, seasonal, interannual, and multidecadal variations are linked to regional weather and large-scale climate ocean-atmosphere dynamics. In the springtime, the Northeast Pacific subtropical high-pressure system strengthens, intensifying northwesterly alongshore winds. These winds drive coastal upwelling that fertilizes nearshore surface water with phytoplankton nutrients, resulting in a dramatic increase in biological productivity. Upwelling weakens over summer into fall, allowing nutrient-depleted offshore water to move toward the coast. Southerly winter storm winds deepen the mixed layer and further enhance onshore flow. El Nifio interrupts these seasonal cycles with varying intensity every three to eight years, but typically peaks during the low-productivity winter season, lessening its biological impact. Over the 1989-2016 period of observation, a negative phase of the multidecadal Pacific Decadal Oscillation is observed as a 15-year cool period following the strong 1997-1998 El Nifio. Two recently identified basin-scale phenomena, the central Pacific El Nifio Modoki and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, increased in strength during this period. In Monterey Bay, primary productivity increased substantially during the cool period, at about 3% per year. This shift also marked the beginning of a monotonic decline in subsurface oxygen, which decreased by 3% annually in the 300-400 m depth horizon, above the oxygen minimum zone. Anthropogenically driven increases in surface pCO(2) and acidity (pH) are notable in Monterey Bay in spite of high near-surface variability. Recently, over 2014-2016, Monterey Bay has warmed, interrupting the 1988-2012 cooling trend. Even with the warm years included, however, there is no overall increasing trend in temperature at any depth from 1988 to the present. A recompilation of historical temperature data back to 1929 indicates that over this longer period, average and cool years have not been significantly different, but warm episodes have been hotter over the last few decades, leading to a trend of increasing temperature over the past 89 years. The 2014-2016 warm period included "the Blob" and an El Nifio, and is reminiscent of similar conditions in the early 1940s. It is not known if the warm conditions will continue, or we will return to a cooler and drier than average period. Our observations highlight the value of long-term data. Such data collections will need to be automated to increase their value and sustainability.

AB Background: Extracurricular school-based sports are considered to be an ideal means of reaching children who are not active in community sports. The purposes of this study were to examine the extent to which pupils not engaging in community sports do participate in extracurricular school-based sports, and to assess whether extracurricular school-based sports participants are more physically active and/or more autonomously motivated towards sports in daily life than children who do not participate in extracurricular school-based sports.
   Methods: One thousand forty-nine children (53.7% boys; M age = 11.02 years, SD = 0.02) out of 60 classes from 30 Flemish elementary schools, with an extracurricular school-based sports offer, completed validated questionnaires to assess physical activity (Flemish Physical Activity Questionnaire) and motivation (Behavioral Regulations in Physical Education Questionnaire). Multilevel regression analyses were conducted to examine the data generated from these questionnaires.
   Results: More than three quarters of the children (76%) reported participating in extracurricular school-based sports during the current school year and 73% reported engaging in organized community sports. Almost two third of the children (65%) not participating in community sports stated that they did participate in extracurricular school-based sports. Extracurricular school-based sports participants were significantly more physically active than children not participating in extracurricular school-based sports (beta = 157.62, p < 0.001). Significant three-way interactions (sex x extracurricular school-based sports participation x community sports participation) were found for autonomous motivation, with boys engaging in extracurricular school-based sports but not in community sports being significantly more autonomously motivated towards sports than boys not engaging in community or extracurricular school-based sports (beta = 0.58, p = 0.003). Such differences were not noted among girls.
   Conclusions: If extracurricular school-based sports are offered at school, the vast majority of elementary school children participate. Although extracurricular school-based sports attract many children already engaging in community sports, they also reach almost two third of the children who do not participate in community sports but who might also be optimally motivated towards sports. As children participating in extracurricular school-based sports are more physically active than children who do not participate, extracurricular school-based sports participation can be considered to contribute to an active lifestyle for these participating children.

AB The quantitative, accurate and efficient acquisition of tree phenotypes is the basis for forest "gene-phenotype-environment " studies. It also offers significant support for clarifying the genetic control mechanisms of tree traits. The application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing technology to the collection of phenotypic traits at an individual tree level quantitatively analyses tree phenology and directionally evaluates tree growth, as well as accelerating the process of forest genetics and breeding. In this study, with the help of high-resolution, high-overlap, multispectral images obtained by an UAV, combined with digital elevation models (DEMs) extracted from point clouds acquired by a backpack LiDAR, a high-throughput tree structure and spectral phenotypic traits extraction and a genetic selection were conducted in a trial of Eucalyptus clones in the State-owned Dongmen Forest Farm in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Firstly, we validated the accuracy of extracting the phenotypic parameters of individual tree growth based on aerial stereo photogrammetry point clouds. Secondly, on this basis, the repeatability of the tree growth traits and vegetation indices (VIs), the genetic correlation coefficients between the traits were calculated. Finally, the eucalypt clones were ranked by integrating a selection index of traits, and the superior genotypes were selected and their genetic gain predicted. The results showed a high accuracy of the tree height (H) extracted from the digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) point cloud based on UAV images (R-2 = 0.91, and RMSE = 0.56 m), and the accuracy of estimating the diameter at breast height (DBH) was R-2 = 0.71, and RMSE = 0.75 cm. All the extracted traits were significantly different within the tree species and among the clones. Except for the crown width (CW), the clonal repeatability (Rc) of the traits were all above 0.9, and the individual repeatability values (Ri) were all above 0.5. The genetic correlation coefficient between the tree growth traits and VIs fluctuated from 0.3 to 0.5, while the best clones were EA14-15, EA14-09, EC184, and EC183 when the selection proportion was 10%. The purpose of this study was to construct a technical framework for phenotypic traits extraction and genetic analysis of trees based on unmanned aerial stereo photography point clouds and high-resolution multispectral images, while also exploring the application potential of this approach in the selective breeding of eucalypt clones.

AB Background: Mirabegron is the first beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist that is clinically effective for overactive bladder.
   Objective: The effects of mirabegron on primary bladder mechanosensitive single-unit afferent activities (SAAs) and bladder microcontractions were evaluated and compared with the effects of oxybutynin.
   Design, setting, and participants: Female Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized. The SAAs generated from left L6 dorsal roots were identified by electrical stimulation of the left pelvic nerve and bladder distension. Nerves with conduction velocities (CVs) >2.5 m/s were designated as A delta-fibers, and nerves with CVs <2.5 m/s were designated as C-fibers.
   Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Two measurements were performed in separate animals. First, after measuring the baselines of SAA during constant filling cystometry, the procedure was repeated with each intravenous administration of mirabegron at three doses-0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg-cumulatively. Second, the bladder was filled with saline until the intravesical pressure reached 30 cm H2O and was kept under an isovolumetric condition; then the recording was performed for 5 min with vehicle and mirabegron or oxybutynin administrated intravenously.
   Results and limitations: A total of 74 single-unit afferent fibers were isolated from 55 rats (A delta-fibers: n = 34; C-fibers: n = 40). SAAs of both A delta-fibers and C-fibers in response to bladder filling significantly decreased after mirabegron administration in a dose-dependent manner, which was more remarkable for A delta-fibers. During an isovolumetric condition of the bladder, the mean bladder pressure and the number of microcontractions decreased after mirabegron administration, whereas these parameters did not change with oxybutynin administration. SAAs of A delta-fibers were significantly decreased by mirabegron administration at both 0.3 and 1 mg/kg, whereas SAAs of C-fibers decreased only at 1 mg/kg. In contrast, oxybutynin (1 mg/kg) did not alter either type of SAA.
   Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that mirabegron can inhibit mechanosensitive bladder afferent activity, especially of A delta-fibers, which may be related to suppression of bladder microcontractions.

AB Insecticide applications are typically being carried out with traditional manual spraying equipment in redgram, which leads to inadequate control of insects due to higher crop height. The modern deployment of tractor-drawn spray machines causes serious damage to the crop. In this connection, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) spray technology has great potential for precise insecticide application in redgram crops. One of the important machine parameters influencing droplet deposition and drift characteristics in UAV sprayers is downwash airflow generated by a multi-rotor propeller. A field experiment was carried out at the redgram research field (N11.01, E76.92), Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, during 2021-2022 to study the spray drift and deposition characteristics of an autonomous UAV sprayer. The Imidacloprid (a.i. 17.8SL) insecticide mixed with water in a ratio of 1 mL per liter was sprayed with a UAV sprayer. Water-sensitive paper samples were kept at upper, middle, and bottom positions on the leaves, and data were analyzed for the spray droplet size, deposition rate, droplet density, and area coverage both in target and non-target areas using Spray Deposit Scanner software. UAV spray droplet deposition rate (2.93 +/- 0.17, 2.01 +/- 0.08, and 2.21 +/- 0.162.38 mu L cm(-2)), droplet density (47 +/- 4.04, 53 +/- 3.61, and 52 +/- 8.74 droplets cm(-2)), and area coverage (15.72 +/- 0.39, 16.60 +/- 0.71, and 14.99 +/- 0.39%) were highest in the upper layer as compared to the middle layer (droplet deposition rate: 1.21 +/- 0.08, 1.07 +/- 0.03, and 0.77 +/- 0.02 mu L cm(-2); droplet density: 42 +/- 2.52, 43 +/- 8.50, and 38 +/- 2.52 droplets cm(-2); area coverage: 10.95 +/- 0.81, 11.22 +/- 0.56, and 8.57 +/- 0.44%) and bottom layer (droplet deposition rate: 0.41 +/- 0.06, 0.35 +/- 0.03, and 0.33 +/- 0.03 mu L cm(-2); droplet density: 22 +/- 4.36, 17 +/- 3.51, and 19 +/- 4.51 droplets cm(-2); area coverage: 2.78 +/- 0.29, 2.95 +/- 0.45, and 2.46 +/- 0.20%, respectively). In the spray drift test, there was a higher droplet deposition rate (1.63 +/- 0.09, 1.93 +/- 0.05, and 1.82 +/- 0.06 mu L cm(-2)), area coverage (14.40 +/- 0.07, 17.54 +/- 0.36, and 16.42 +/- 0.30%), and droplet density (46 +/- 3.61, 54 +/- 2.08, and 45 +/- 3.21 No's cm(-2)) in the target area as compared to the non-target area (droplet deposition rate: 0.88 +/- 0.02, 0.46 +/- 0.03, 0.22 +/- 0.05, and 0.00 mu L cm(-2); droplet density: 23 +/- 1.53, 11 +/- 2.08, 6 +/- 1.53, and 0.00 droplets cm(-2); area coverage: 7.58 +/- 0.34, 4.41 +/- 0.19, 2.16 +/- 0.05, and 0.00%, respectively), which may have been due to the downwash airflow produced by the multi-rotor propeller of the UAV sprayer. Finally, the UAV-based spraying technology results showed that the downwash air produced by the six-rotor propeller improved the penetrability of insecticide to crop leaves and led to a higher droplet deposition rate, droplet density, area coverage, and droplet penetrability on the upper layer, middle layer, and bottom layer of the plants.

AB The Exploration Ground Data Systems (xGDS) project led by the Intelligent Robotics Group (IRG) at NASA Ames Research Center creates software tools to support multiple NASA-led planetary analog field experiments. The two primary tools that fall under the xGDS umbrella are the xGDS Web Tools (xGDS-WT) and Visual Environment for Remote Virtual Exploration (VERVE). IRG has also developed a hardware and software system that is closely integrated with our xGDS tools and is used in multiple field experiments called Gigapan Voyage. xGDS-WT, VERVE, and Gigapan Voyage are examples of IRG projects that improve the ratio of science return versus development effort by creating generic and reusable tools that leverage existing technologies in both hardware and software.
   xGDS Web Tools provides software for gathering and organizing mission data for science and engineering operations, including tools for planning traverses, monitoring autonomous or piloted vehicles, visualization, documentation, analysis, and search. VERVE provides high performance three dimensional (3D) user interfaces used by scientists, robot operators, and mission planners to visualize robot data in real time. Gigapan Voyage is a gigapixel image capturing and processing tool that improves situational awareness and scientific exploration in human and robotic analog missions. All of these technologies emphasize software reuse and leverage open source and/or commercial-off-the-shelf tools to greatly improve the utility and reduce the development and operational cost of future similar technologies.
   Over the past several years these technologies have been used in many NASA-led robotic field campaigns including the Desert Research and Technology Studies (DRATS), the Pavilion Lake Research Project (PLRP), the K10 Robotic Follow-Up tests, and most recently we have become involved in the NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) field experiments. A major objective of these joint robot and crew experiments is to improve NASAs understanding of how to most effectively execute and increase science return from exploration missions. This paper focuses on an integrated suite of xGDS software and compatible hardware tools: xGDS Web Tools, VERVE, and Gigapan Voyage, how they are used, and the design decisions that were made to allow them to be easily developed, integrated, tested, and reused by multiple NASA field experiments and robotic platforms.

AB Environment perception constitutes one of the most critical operations performed by semiand fully- autonomous vehicles. In recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become the standard tool for perception solutions owing to their impressive capabilities in analyzing and modelling complex and dynamic scenes, from (often multi-modal) sensory inputs. However, the well-established performance of DNNs comes at the cost of increased time and storage complexity, which may become problematic in automotive perception systems due to the requirement for a short prediction horizon (as in many cases inference must be performed in real-time) and the limited computational, storage, and energy resources of mobile systems. A common way of addressing this problem is to transform the original large pretrained networks into new smaller models, by utilizing Model Compression and Acceleration (MCA) techniques, improving both their storage and execution efficiency. Within the MCA framework, in this paper, we investigate the application of two state-of-the-art weight-sharing MCA techniques, namely a Vector Quantization (VQ) and a Dictionary Learning (DL) one, as well as two novel extensions, towards the acceleration and compression of widely used DNNs for 2D and 3D object-detection in automotive applications. Apart from the individual (uni-modal) networks, we also present and evaluate a multi-modal late-fusion algorithm for combining the detection results of the 2D and 3D detectors. Our evaluation studies are carried out on the KITTI Dataset. The obtained results lend themselves to a twofold interpretation. On the one hand, they showcase the significant acceleration and compression gains that can be achieved via the application of weight sharing on the selected DNN detectors, with limited accuracy loss, as well as highlight the performance differences between the two utilized weight-sharing approaches. On the other, they demonstrate the substantial boost in detection performance obtained by combining the outcome of the two unimodal individual detectors, using the proposed late-fusion-based multi-modal approach. Indeed, as our experiments have shown, pairing the high-performance DL-based MCA technique with the loss-mitigating effect of the multi-modal fusion approach, leads to highly accelerated models (up to approximately 2.5x and 6x for the 2D and 3D detectors, respectively) with the performance loss of the fused results ranging in most cases within single-digits figures (as low as around 1% for the class ``cars'').

AB The ever-increasing demands for autonomy and precision have led to the development of heavily computational multi-robot system (MRS). However, numerous missions exclude the use of robotic cloud. Another solution is to use the robotic cluster to locally distribute the computational load. This complex distribution requires adaptability to come up with a dynamic and uncertain environment. Classical approaches are too limited to solve this problem, but recent advances in reinforcement learning and deep learning offer new opportunities. In this paper we propose a new Deep Q-Network (DQN) based approaches where the MRS learns to distribute tasks directly from experience. Since the problem complexity leads to a curse of dimensionality, we use two specific methods, a new branching architecture, called Branching Dueling Q-Network (BDQ), and our own optimized multi-agent solution and we compare them with classical Market-based approaches as well as with non-distributed and purely local solutions. Our study shows the relevancy of learning-based methods for task mapping and also highlight the BDQ architecture capacity to solve high dimensional state space problems. Note to Practitioners-A lot of applications in industry like area exploration and monitoring can be efficiently delegated to a group of small-size robots or autonomous vehicles with advantages like reliability and cost in respect of single-robot solutions. But autonomy requires high and increasing compute-intensive tasks such as computer-vision. On the other hand small robots have energy constraints, limited embedded computing capacities and usually restricted and/or unreliable communications that limit the use of cloud resources. An alternative solution to cope with this problem consists in sharing the computing resources of the group of robots. Previous work was a proof of concept limited to the parallelisation of a single specific task. In this paper we formalize a general method that allows the group of robots to learn on the field how to efficiently distribute tasks in order to optimize the execution time of a mission under energy constraint. We demonstrate the relevancy of our solution over market-based and non-distributed approaches by means of intensive simulations. This successful study is a necessary first step towards distribution and parallelisation of computation tasks over a robotic cluster. The next steps, not tested yet, will address hardware in the loop simulation and finally a real-life mission with a group of robots.

AB This study combined measurements from multiple platforms with acoustic instruments on moorings and on a ship and optics on a profiler and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to examine the relationships between fluorescent, bioluminescent, and acoustically scattering layers in Monterey Bay during nighttime hours in July and August of 2006 and May of 2008. We identified thin bioluminescent layers that were strongly correlated with acoustic scattering at the same depth but were part of vertically broad acoustic features, suggesting layers of unique composition inside larger biomass features. These compositional thin layers nested inside larger biomass features may be a common ecosystem component and are likely to have significant ecological impacts but are extremely difficult to identify as most approaches capable of the vertical scales of measurement necessary for the identification of sub-meter scale patterns assess bulk properties rather than specific layer composition. Measurements of multiple types of thin layers showed that the depth offset between thin phytoplankton and zooplankton layers was highly variable with some layers found at the same depth but others found up to 16 m apart. The vertical offset between phytoplankton and zooplankton thin layers was strongly predicted by the fraction of the water column fluorescence contained within a thin phytoplankton layer. Thin zooplankton layers were only vertically associated with thin phytoplankton layers when the phytoplankton in a layer accounted for more than about 18-20% of the water column chlorophyll. Trophic interactions were likely occurring between phytoplankton and zooplankton thin layers but phytoplankton thin layers were exploited by zooplankton only when they represented a large fraction of the available phytoplankton, suggesting zooplankton have some knowledge of the available food over the entire water column. The horizontal extent of phytoplankton layers, discussed in the second paper in this series, is likely an important factor contributing to this selective exploitation by zooplankton. The pattern of vertical offset between phytoplankton and zooplankton layers was consistent between studies in different years and using different combinations of platforms, indicating the importance of the relationship between zooplankton layers and the fraction of phytoplankton within a layer at night within Monterey Bay. These results highlight the value of integrating measurements of various types of organisms to understand thin layers processes and the importance of assessing ecological interactions in plankton thin layers within the context of the properties of the entire water column, like the animals themselves do.

TI Toward Elevated Agrobotics: Development of a Scaled-Down Prototype for
   Visually Guided Date Palm Tree Sprayer
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
ID AGRICULTURAL VEHICLES; AUTOMATIC GUIDANCE; FRUIT
AB Agricultural operations at great heights are typically laborious, expensive, and dangerous for human workers. Spraying and pollinating date palm trees, for instance, is currently done manually by a team of several workers from a platform lifted 18 m or more above the ground. This method is extremely unsafe, and many accidents have occurred due to instability when the platform is in a lifted position. In this paper we present the concept of an autonomous field robot that will effectively and accurately spray and pollinate date clusters. A scaled-down prototype has been designed and consists of a visually controlled robotic arm that guides the jet of a mounted sprayer directly to the date clusters completely autonomously and from a short distance. Rather than requiring an expensive dedicated platform, this robotic apparatus can be towed by a standard tractor operated by a single driver, with no human worker operating in the heights. This system can minimize risk of injury, significantly save manpower, and deliver the spray with maximum accuracy, thereby reducing chemical disposal. The spraying guidance system is based on a proportional controller that uses feedback from an image processing system combined with a small dead band. The system was modeled mathematically, and the effect of each component on overall performance was evaluated by simulation. Results were used for tuning the experimental system controller parameters. Experiments were performed to evaluate the tracking performance of the visually guided tracking system on a single tree and a 10-m-long runway at a distance of 6 m. These dimensions were inspired by the conditions at a typical orchard. During the experiment the sprayer was towed along the runway 19 times, during which the speed of the wagon was varied between 0.7 km/h (0.2 m/s) and 12 km/h (3-3 m/s). Experimental results indicate that up to a wagon velocity of 1.25 m/s the tracking error was reasonably low and stayed below 10 deg from the center of the target (typical date spraying speed is 1.1 m/s). However, at higher speeds the tracking quality reduced progressively and some drift (i.e., accumulated error) was noticed in the pan axis due to image processing speed. The simulations and experiments with a scaled-down prototype show feasibility of the presented method and demonstrate how this new approach facilitates more efficient high-altitude agricultural robotics.

AB Network slicing has been widely agreed as a promising technique to accommodate diverse services for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory/manufacturing are the three key services to form the backbone of IIoT. Network slicing management is of paramount importance in the face of IIoT services with diversified requirements. It is important to have a comprehensive survey on intelligent network slicing management to provide guidance for future research in this field. In this paper, we provide a thorough investigation and analysis of network slicing management in its general use cases as well as specific IIoT services including smart transportation, smart energy and smart factory, and highlight the advantages and drawbacks across many existing works/surveys and this current survey in terms of a set of important criteria. In addition, we present an architecture for intelligent network slicing management for IIoT focusing on the above three IIoT services. For each service, we provide a detailed analysis of the application requirements and network slicing architecture, as well as the associated enabling technologies. Further, we present a deep understanding of network slicing orchestration and management for each service, in terms of orchestration architecture, AI-assisted management and operation, edge computing empowered network slicing, reliability, and security. For the presented architecture for intelligent network slicing management and its application in each IIoT service, we identify the corresponding key challenges and open issues that can guide future research. To facilitate the understanding of the implementation, we provide a case study of the intelligent network slicing management for integrated smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory. Some lessons learnt include: 1) For smart transportation, it is necessary to explicitly identify service function chains (SFCs) for specific applications along with the orchestration of underlying VNFs/PNFs for supporting such SFCs; 2) For smart energy, it is crucial to guarantee both ultra-low latency and extremely high reliability; 3) For smart factory, resource management across heterogeneous network domains is of paramount importance. We hope that this survey is useful for both researchers and engineers on the innovation and deployment of intelligent network slicing management for IIoT.

AB We compare estimates of krill density derived from gliders to those from contemporaneous and previous ship-based surveys. Our comparisons cover several temporal and spatial scales within two strata around the northern Antarctic Peninsula (off Cape Shirreff on the north side of Livingston Island and in the Bransfield Strait). Our objective is to explore the feasibility of using gliders to supplement or replace vessel-based surveys of fishery resources. We deployed two long-duration Slocum G3 gliders manufactured by Teledyne Webb Research (TWR), each equipped with a suite of oceanographic sensors and a three-frequency (38, 67.5, and 125 kHz, each single-beam) Acoustic Zooplankton Fish Profiler. We used the acoustic data collected by these gliders to estimate biomass densities (g.m(-2)) of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). The two gliders were, respectively, deployed for 82 and 88 days from mid-December 2018 through mid-March 2019. Off Cape Shirreff, glider-based densities estimated from two repeat small-scale surveys during mid-December and January were 110.6 and 55.7 g.m(-2), respectively. In Bransfield Strait, the glider-based estimate of biomass density was 106.7 g.m(-2) during December-January. Contemporaneous ship-based estimates of biomass density, from a multi-ship broad-scale krill survey (Macaulay et al., 2019) restricted to the areas sampled by the gliders, were 84.6 g.m(-2) off Cape Shirreff and 79.7 g.m(-2) in Bransfield Strait during January. We compared two alternative krill-delineation algorithms (dB differencing and SHAPES); differences between biomass densities estimated by applying these algorithms were small and ranged between 4 and 7%. Alternative methods of sampling krill length-frequency distributions (LFDs) (nets or predator diets), which are required to convert acoustic energy to biomass density, also influenced the glider-based results. In Bransfield Strait, net-based estimates of biomass density were 6% less than those based on predator diets. Off Cape Shirreff the biomass density of krill estimated from a net-based LFD was 20% greater than that based on predator diets. Development of a variance estimator for glider-based biomass surveys is ongoing, but our results demonstrate that fisheries surveys using acoustically-equipped gliders are feasible, can provide density estimates to inform management, and may be conducted at lower cost than ship surveys in some cases.

AB This paper aims to describe the methodology used in the design and manufacture of a fixed-wing aircraft manufactured using additive techniques together with the implementation of technology based on solar panels. The main objective is increasing the autonomy and range of the UAV's autonomous missions. Moreover, one of the main targets is to improve the capabilities of the aeronautical industry towards sustainable aircrafts and to acquire better mechanical properties owing to the use of additive technologies and new printing materials. Further, a lower environmental impact could be achieved through the use of renewable energies. Material extrusion (MEX) technology may be able to be used for the manufacture of stronger and lighter parts by using gyroids as the filling of the printed material. The paper proposes the use of minimal surfaces for the reinforcement of the UAV aircraft wings. This type of surface was never used because it is not possible to manufacture it using conventional techniques. The rapid growth of additive technologies led to many expectations for new design methodologies in the aeronautical industry. In this study, mechanical tests were carried out on specimens manufactured with different geometries to address the design and manufacture of a UAV as a demonstrator. In addition, to carry out the manufacture of the prototype, a 3D printer with a movable bench similar to a belt, that allows for the manufacture of parts without limitations in the Z axis, was tested. The parts manufactured with this technique can be structurally improved, and it is possible to avoid manufacturing multiple prints of small parts of the aircraft that will have to be glued later, decreasing the mechanical properties of the UAV. The conceptual design and manufacturing of a solar aircraft, SolariO, using additive technologies, is presented. A study of the most innovative 3D printers was carried out that allowed for the manufacture of parts with an infinite Z-axis and, in addition, a filler based on minimal surfaces (gyroids) was applied, which considerably increased the mechanical properties of the printed parts. Finally, it can be stated that in this article, the potential of the additive manufacturing as a new manufacturing process for small aircrafts and for the aeronautical sector in the future when new materials and more efficient additive manufacturing processes are already developed is demonstrated.

AB Background: Oversimplified, reductionist approaches to operationalising Physical Literacy (PL) have been a barrier to the development of a complex, dynamic and embodied understanding of the individual Physical Literacy journey. Further, there has been no appropriate approach that might allow practitioners to integrate Physical Literacy in Physical Education (PE). Whilst popular approaches, such as Teaching Games for Understanding (TGfU) and Game Sense (GS), for operationalising learner-centred and problem-based learning, have gained professional traction in the last three decades, the development of a comprehensive theoretical basis to underpin pedagogical principles has been neglected - particularly in Physical Education. Pedagogical approaches grounded in play have gained popularity as a vehicle for Physical Literacy development in Physical Education. Despite the prominence of a Constraint-Led Approach (CLA) in sport pedagogy to assist in developing the intelligent, autonomous individual' in sport, application to Physical Education is limited.Purpose: In this article, we propose key pedagogical principles of a Constraints-Led Approach (CLA) in primary physical education, underpinned by the theoretical framework of Ecological Dynamics (ED). Driven by the challenge of designing affordance landscapes for learning, we present our reflections on a recently designed PE curriculum for primary schools, Boing, which could facilitate the development of movement capacities in play-based curricula designed to nurture the Physical Literacy journey for individuals. An articulation of support for the key theoretical ideas is provided in this paper.Design: This is achieved through reflections on the play-based curriculum (BOING) founded on the principles of Ecological Dynamics (ED) underpinning a Constraints-Led approach (CLA) to better serve the implementation of a Physical Literacy focussed Physical Education in a Primary school setting based on key principles for delivery.Findings: Summarising the findings, the we were able to highlight the importance of developing key principles for delivering a theoretically informed curriculum that elicits key principles of Physical Literacy. Whilst movement skills are key, these approaches are able to elicit the intended outcomes in learners of confidence, motivation and competence (Whitehead 2010, 2016).Conclusions: A CLA affords the theoretical design of play-based curricula beyond just play or sport towards purposeful, inclusive learning environments. Practitioners should look to underpin their practice with key theoretical ideas. This paper is of particular interest to those coaches and teachers tasked with designing practical environments for learning beyond the rhetoric of skill development in sport.

AB [1] The fault restoration technique of De Chabalier and Avouac [1994] is applied to an ultra-high-resolution bathymetry data set from the East Pacific Rise (EPR) at 18degrees 14'S. Fault offsets are calculated and subtracted from the original seafloor bathymetry to examine the morphology of the unfaulted seafloor surface within an area encompassing the ridge axis 400 1600 m in dimension. The restored topography reveals a gently sloping seafloor 200 m wide, which slopes 5 inward toward the spreading axis. We attribute this inward sloping seafloor to subsidence within the axial trough due to subsurface magmatic deflation. The vertical deformation field extracted from the bathymetry is used to characterize the ridge axis fault population present in the area. Median fault throws (9 m for inward-facing and 8 m for outward-facing faults) are comparable to values measured for nearby mature abyssal hill fault populations, suggesting a genetic link. However, median fault spacings (70 and 46 m) are an order of magnitude smaller, and estimated total extensional strain is 3x-4x greater than values measured for ridge flank faults. These differences indicate the axial fault population at 18 14 S cannot be rafted onto the ridge flanks to form abyssal hill faults without significant modification, presumably via volcanic burial. We attribute the dense faulting observed in this area to slip on axial fissures during subsidence of the crestal region. The surface subsidence of a volcanic edifice can be modeled in terms of volume change in the magma source reservoir and volume of magma withdrawn from the reservoir. Using the relationship derived for a sill-like magma body, we estimate that the axial depression at 18 14 S could represent magma withdrawal associated with a small number (4-22) of the frequent dike injection and eruption events required to build the upper crust during the evolution of the trough. The subsidence volumes represented by the axial topography at 18 14 S are a small percentage of the underlying upper crustal sections (3-4%), suggesting that only a minor mismatch between magma recharge and withdrawal from the axial melt lens during ongoing plate separation could account for this pronounced axial depression.

AB Meter-scale AUV bathymetric mapping and ROV sampling of the entire 47 km-long Alarcon Rise between the Pescadero and Tamayo transforms show that the shallowest inflated portion of the segment hosts all four active hydrothermal vent fields and the youngest, hottest, and highest effusion rate lava flows. This shallowest inflated part is located similar to 1/3 of the way between the Tamayo and Pescadero transforms and is paved by a 16 km(2) channelized flow that erupted from 9 km of en echelon fissures and is larger than historic flows on the East Pacific Rise or on the Gorda and Juan de Fuca Ridges. Starting similar to 5 km south of the Pescadero transform, 6.5 km of the Alarcon Rise is characterized by faulted ridges and domes of fractionated lavas ranging from basaltic andesite to rhyolite with up to 77.3 wt % SiO2. These are the first known rhyolites from the submarine global mid-ocean ridge system. Silicic lavas range from >11.7 ka, to as young as 1.1 ka. A basalt-to-basaltic andesite sequence and an andesite-to-dacite-to-rhyolite sequence are consistent with crystal fractionation but some intermediate basaltic andesite and andesite formed by mixing basalt with dacite or rhyolite. Magmatism occurred along the bounding Tamayo and Pescadero transforms as extensive channelized flows. The flows erupted from ring faults surrounding uplifted sediment hills inferred to overlie sills. The transforms are transtensional to accommodate magma migration from the adjacent Alarcon Rise.
   Plain Language Summary This study combines 1 m resolution bathymetry collected using an autonomous underwater vehicle, with chemical compositions of precisely located lava samples and ages of lava flows determined from short sediment cores collected using a remotely operated vehicle. The objective was to determine the history of an entire 47 km long segment of the global mid-ocean ridge system. The ridge segment studied is named the Alarcon Rise and is located at the mouth of the Gulf of California. The Rise is bounded to the north and south by strike-slip faults that offset the Rise from adjacent segments of the spreading ridge system. Such faults are usually thought to be parallel to the direction of seafloor spreading, but these have an oblique component to their movement that makes space for magma to be injected along the faults where it uplifts hills of sediment and sometimes erupts. Most lavas erupted along mid-ocean ridges are basalts, but some highly unusual silica-rich lavas were identified by their rough surface texture and sampled. These lavas include the most silica-rich ones found along the entire global submarine mid-ocean ridge system. They formed, not by melting of nearby continental crust, but from common basalt by extreme amounts of crystallization of minerals, leaving a small volume of remaining high-silica magma. The complete mapping and closely spaced sampling along the Rise show that old ideas indicating a central point of magma delivery from the underlying mantle for each ridge segment followed by shallow transport of the magmas along the ridge are supported by the central distribution of (1) hydrothermally active sites, (2) the youngest, hottest, most fluid lava flows, and (3) the most voluminous lava flows that accumulate to form the shallowest portion of the ridge segment. The study shows how magmas are transported at shallow depths along the ridge and even around the corners in the adjacent faults.

AB The topographic fabric of the rift valley floor has been analyzed using the multibeam echosounder data obtained by the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) Abyss at two locations over a short segment of the slow-spreading Central Indian Ridge between 10 degrees 18' and 10 degrees 57'S. The region is influenced by hydrothermal venting in the near vicinity. Two AUV dives D51 and D52 were performed over this segment at two locations that are 30 km apart and covered 5 km(2) and 8 km(2) seafloor area, respectively. The dive D51 covered the off-axis part of the rift valley floor in the middle part of the segment, and the dive D52 is located near to the non-transform discontinuity that covered the terminal part of an oceanic core complex (OCC). High-resolution seafloor topography as revealed by the AUV-mounted multibeam echosounder system brought out several micro-bathymetric fabric features such as a lava lake, a cratered volcano, an OCC, and the foot wall volcanic complex at the distal part of the OCC. The valley floor imaged in the D51 is marked by a lava flow encompassing an area of 1 km(2) and a volcano in the NE corner. The volcano has a diameter of about 800 m with an elevation of about 200 m from the adjacent seafloor, and the partially mapped volcano crater has a relief of about 60 m. A prominent linear fissure running parallel to the ridge axis has been identified; this feature joins with the volcano. Analysis of AUV-mounted CTD data indicated three distinct temperature spikes ranging 0.009 to 0.013 degrees C in the region of dive D51. The observed temperature spikes appear to be related to the linear fissure on the seafloor and probably represent leaky venting of fluids from the fissure. With respect to the dive D52, the foot wall volcanic features associated with the OCC are prominent. The volcanic seafloor feature covered an area of 3.45 km(2) and is conspicuous with rugged topographic fabric at the base of the OCC. These inferences and the morphotectonics of the rift valley floor as revealed by the AUV data suggest moderate hydrothermal venting in this segment of the slow-spreading Central Indian Ridge.

AB Objective: As bicyclists account for the largest share of serious injuries in Sweden, focus to improve safety for bicyclists is needed. While knowledge about fatal bicycle crashes is rather extensive, the number of studies that have investigated non-fatal injuries is still rather limited. The aim of this study was to estimate the potential of different countermeasures to reduce crashes resulting in injuries with high risk of health-loss among cyclists in Sweden. A further aim was to describe the residual-that is, crashes that were not considered to be addressed by the analyzed countermeasures. Methods: A sample of individuals with specific injury diagnoses was drawn from the Swedish national crash database Strada. A survey form was used to collect additional information about the crash and the health-related outcomes. The potential of countermeasures currently included in the Swedish Safety Performance Indicators, as well as of countermeasures that could be described as "existing but not fully implemented" was assessed. The overall potential of all countermeasures assessed was calculated, giving a grand total without double counting. Cases that were considered not to be addressed by any of the countermeasures included (i.e., the residual crashes) were described in more detail. Results: The current Swedish Safety Performance Indicators that relate to safe cycling addressed 22% of crashes. Improved maintenance by deicing and removal of snow from bicycle infrastructure was found to have the highest potential (8%), followed by improved crashworthiness of passenger cars (5%) and safer bicycle crossings (4%). The potential for existing but not fully implemented safety improvements was 56%. The greatest potential was found for Autonomous Emergency Braking with cyclist detection for passenger cars (12%), followed by studded winter tyres for bicycles (12%), and improved maintenance on non-bicycle infrastructure (11%). In total, taking double counting into consideration, all safety improvements could address 64% of all crashes. Among the residual crashes, the majority (69%) were single bicycle crashes of which most were related to wheel locking during braking and losing balance at low speed or stationary. Conclusions: Compared with fatal crashes that involve a majority of bicycle-car crashes, the crashes leading to health-loss are mostly single bicycle crashes. Therefore, innovation and development of additional countermeasures to improve safety for bicyclists should focus on single bicycle crashes.

AB Recent breakthroughs in deep-learning algorithms enable dreams of artificial intelligence (AI) getting close to reality. AI-based technologies are now being developed rapidly, including service and industrial robots, autonomous and self-driving vehicles. This work proposes Two-Way Deepnets (TW-Deepnets) trained using the physics-law-based models such as finite element method (FEM), smoothed FEM (S-FEM), and meshfree models, for real-time computations of both forward and inverse mechanics problems of materials and structures. First, unique features of physics-law-based models and data-based models are analyzed in theory. The training characteristics of deepnets for forward problems governed by physics-laws are then investigated, when an FEM (or S-FEM) model is used as the trainer. The training convergence rates of such an FEM-AI model are examined in relation to the property of the system matrix of the FEM model for deepnets. Next, a study on the training characteristics of deepnets for inverse problems, when the forward FEM-trained AI Deepnets are used as the trainer to train an AI model for inverse analyses. Next, a discussion is conducted on the roles of regularization techniques to overcome the ill-posedness of inverse problems in deepnet structures for noisy data. Finally, TW-Deepnets (FEM-AI and AI-AI models) are presented for real-time analyses of both forward and inverse problems of materials and structures with high-dimensional parameter space. The major finding of this study is as follows: (1) The understandings on the fundamental features of both data-based and physics-based methods is critical for creations of novel game-changing computational methods, which take advantages of both types of methods; (2) The good property of the system matrix of FEM allows effective training of FEM-AI deepnets for forward mechanics problems; (3) Our new technique to training inverse deepnets using FEM-AI deepnets as a surrogate model offers an innovative means, to effectively train deepnets for solving inverse mechanics problems; (4) The TW-Deepnets is capable of performing real-time analysis of both forward and inverse problems of materials and structures with high-dimensional parameter spaces; (5) Such TW-Deepnets can be easily utilized by the mass: a transformative new concept of AI-enabling democratization of complicated computational technology in modeling and simulation.

AB Persistence of oil floating in the ocean is an important factor for evaluating hydrocarbon fluxes from natural seeps and anthropogenic releases into the environment. The objective of this work is to estimate the surface residence time of the oil slick and to determine the importance of wind and surface currents on the trajectory and fate of the released oil. Oil slicks released from natural hydrocarbon seeps located in Green Canyon 600 lease block and its surrounding region in the Gulf of Mexico were analyzed. A Texture Classifying Neural Network Algorithm was used to delineate georectified polygons for oil slicks from 41 synthetic aperture radar images. Trajectories of the oil slicks were investigated by employing a Lagrangian particle-tracking surface oil drift model. A set of numerical simulations was performed by increasing hindcast interval in reverse time order from the image collection time in order to obtain the closest resemblance between the simulated oil pathways and the length and shape of the oil slicks observed in synthetic aperture radar images. The average surface residence-time predicted from the hindcast modeling was 6.4 h (+/- 5.7 h). Analysis of a linear regression model, including observed oil slick lengths and variables of wind, surface current, and their relative direction, indicated a statistically significant negative effect of wind speed on the surface oil drift. Higher wind speed (>7 m s(-1)) reduced length of the oil slicks. When wind and surface currents were driving forces of the surface oil drift model, a good agreement between simulated trajectories and subsequent satellite observations (R-2 = 0.9) suggested that a wind scaling coefficient of 0.035 and a wind deflection angle of 20 to the right of the wind direction were acceptable approximations for modeling wind effects in this study. Results from the numerical experimentation were supported by in situ observations conducted by a wind-powered autonomous surface vehicle (SailDrone). Results indicated that the surface currents are, indeed, responsible for stretching oil slicks and that surface winds are largely responsible for the disappearance of the oil slicks from the sea surface. Under conditions of low wind and strong current, natural seeps can produce oil slicks that are longer than 20 km and persist for up to 48 h. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI COCO-Bridge: Structural Detail Data Set for Bridge Inspections
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID CRACK DETECTION
AB The purpose of this research is to propose a means to address two issues faced by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) during bridge inspection. The first issue is that UAVs have a notoriously difficult time operating near bridges. This is because of the potential for the navigation signal to be lost between the operator and the UAV. Therefore, there is a push to automate or semiautomate the UAV inspection process. One way to improve automation is by improving UAVs' ability to contextualize their environment through object detection and object avoidance. The second issue is that, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no method has been developed to automatically contextualize detected defects to a structural bridge detail during or after UAV flight. Significant research has been conducted on UAVs' ability to detect defects, like cracks and corrosion. However, detecting the presence of a defect alone does not contextualize its significance or help with an inspector's job to rate specific structural bridge details. This paper outlines a use case for a data set and model to detect critical structural bridge details, providing context and vision for enhancing the autonomous UAV bridge inspection process. Identifying these structural bridge details that require inspection may assist an UAV in path planning and object avoidance in GPS-denied environments. The detection of structural details adds an ability to contextualize defect detection and localize issues to a bridge detail. This also has implications for providing cues to inspectors, in real time, on defect-susceptible areas while UAVs are in flight. The image data set, Common Objects in Context for bridge inspection (COCO-Bridge), for UAV object detection was collected and then trained using deep learning techniques. This data set consists of 774 images and over 2,500 object instances to detect 4 structural bridge details: bearings, cover plate terminations, gusset plate connections, and out-of-plane stiffeners. These details were chosen because they either must be rated by an inspector or checked because they are prone to failure. Methods to economize the predictive capabilities of the model through image augmentation were investigated to extend the performance of the training images. It was concluded that for this domain of data, structural bridge detail images, the mean average precision, and F1 score performance were improved by mirroring the training images along their y-axis. The outcome of this paper was an open-source annotated data set, which can be used in computer vision applications for visual inspection, growing the capabilities of artificial intelligence in structural engineering.

AB Coral reefs play a key role in coastal protection and habitat provision. They are also well known for their recreational value. Attempts to protect these ecosystems have not successfully stopped large-scale degradation. Significant efforts have been made by government and research organizations to ensure that coral reefs are monitored systematically to gain a deeper understanding of the causes, the effects and the extent of threats affecting coral reefs. However, further research is needed to fully understand the importance that sampling design has on coral reef characterization and assessment. This study examines the effect that sampling design has on the estimation of seascape metrics when coupling semi-autonomous underwater vehicles, structure-from-motion photogrammetry techniques and high resolution (0.4 cm) underwater imagery. For this purpose, we use FRAGSTATS v4 to estimate key seascape metrics that enable quantification of the area, density, edge, shape, contagion, interspersion and diversity of sessile organisms for a range of sampling scales (0.5 m x 0.5 m, 2 m x 2 m, 5 m x 5 m, 7 m x 7 m), quadrat densities (from 1-100 quadrats) and sampling strategies (nested vs. random) within a 1655 m(2) case study area in Ponta do Ouro Partial Marine Reserve (Mozambique). Results show that the benthic community is rather disaggregated within a rocky matrix; the embedded patches frequently have a small size and a regular shape; and the population is highly represented by soft corals. The genus Acropora is the more frequent and shows bigger colonies in the group of hard corals. Each of the seascape metrics has specific requirements of the sampling scale and quadrat density for robust estimation. Overall, the majority of the metrics were accurately identified by sampling scales equal to or coarser than 5 m x 5 m and quadrat densities equal to or larger than 30. The study indicates that special attention needs to be dedicated to the design of coral reef monitoring programmes, with decisions being based on the seascape metrics and statistics being determined. The results presented here are representative of the eastern South Africa coral reefs and are expected to be transferable to coral reefs with similar characteristics. The work presented here is limited to one study site and further research is required to confirm the findings.

   aerial vehicle; Habituation
AB Robotic herding is expected to become a new technology for the management of grazing animals. We investi-gated the behavioral responses of cows to drone herding on consecutive days and the potential of this technology to manipulate grazing distribution in a pasture. A herd of similar to 30 cows was stocked in a 1.1-ha pasture for 5 consecutive days each month from May to October 2022. The cows were herded using a drone for 10 days during the grazing period in August (days 1-5) and September (days 6-10). The pasture was divided into nine plots, with two and three plots assigned as the 'herding area' in August and September, respectively. When the cows were grazing in the herding area, the operator maneuvered the drone to move the animals out of the area. The drone first approached at an altitude of 10 m; if the cows did not move away, the altitude was gradually lowered to 3 m. The behavioral responses to the drone, success or failure of herding (whether the cows left the area or not), and drone altitude were classified based on videos recorded during herding. The behavior and location of the cows in the pasture were observed during this period. The utilization rates of the plots (percentage of grazing time) were calculated to evaluate the effects of herding and the number of herding days. The cows responded in 59% and 46% of the cases on days 1 and 2, respectively. Startle behavior was recorded in 23% of the responses on day 1. Herding was successful in 51-75% of the cases on days 1-3. However, these percentages decreased thereafter. The utilization rate of the herding area on day 1 was approximately half that on days without herding. It increased from day 2, and almost no effect on grazing distribution was observed on or after day 3. These findings suggest that the cows exhibited little fear of drones after 1-day herding, and responses to the drones decreased as the animals subsequently became habituated to frequently repeated stimuli. Even after a 24-day interval, responsiveness to drone herding barely recovered and then declined. Therefore, drone herding was hardly effective in manipulating grazing distribution. Further investigation of stimulation that persistently elicits desirable responses is needed for future applications in technologies for the autonomous control of animal movement.

AB Background The application of autopilot technology is conductive to achieving path planning navigation and liberating labor productivity. In addition, the self-driving vehicles can drive according to the growth state of crops to ensure the accuracy of spraying and pesticide effect. Navigation line detection is the core technology of self-driving technology, which plays a more important role in the development of Chinese intelligent agriculture. The general algorithms for seedling line extraction in the agricultural fields are for large seedling crops. At present, scholars focus more on how to reduce the impact of crop row adhesion on extraction of crop rows. However, for seedling crops, especially double-row sown seedling crops, the navigation lines cannot be extracted very effectively due to the lack of plants or the interference of rut marks caused by wheel pressure on seedlings. To solve these problems, this paper proposed an algorithm that combined edge detection and OTSU to determine the seedling column contours of two narrow rows for cotton crops sown in wide and narrow rows. Furthermore, the least squares were used to fit the navigation line where the gap between two narrow rows of cotton was located, which could be well adapted to missing seedlings and rutted print interference. Results The algorithm was developed using images of cotton at the seedling stage. Apart from that, the accuracy of route detection was tested under different lighting conditions and in maize and soybean at the seedling stage. According to the research results, the accuracy of the line of sight for seedling cotton was 99.2%, with an average processing time of 6.63 ms per frame; the accuracy of the line of sight for seedling corn was 98.1%, with an average processing time of 6.97 ms per frame; the accuracy of the line of sight for seedling soybean was 98.4%, with an average processing time of 6.72 ms per frame. In addition, the standard deviation of lateral deviation is 2 cm, and the standard deviation of heading deviation is 0.57 deg. Conclusion The proposed rows detection algorithm could achieve state-of-the-art performance. Besides, this method could ensure the normal spraying speed by adapting to different shadow interference and the randomness of crop row growth. In terms of the applications, it could be used as a reference for the navigation line fitting of other growing crops in complex environments disturbed by shadow.

AB This work focuses on the North Aegean Sea deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) dynamics, as revealed during the first glider mission over the continental shelf and slope of the Thracian Sea and along the Athos basin, and presents a conceptual model on the response of the DCM in relation to the prevailing stratification/mixing of the water column. Water temperature, conductivity, salinity, chlorophyll-a, CDOM, DO and particle backscatter data (bb700), were recorded during this underwater glider mission in summer 2019. Daily satellite data from Sentinel 3 complemented the glider collected data to validate the satellite-derived estimates of surface Chlorophyll-a levels. The high-resolution physical and chemical observations were analyzed emphasizing on thermal stratification, pycnocline strength, CDOM and dissolved oxygen vertical distribution and the presence of deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM). DCM statistical characteristics were derived by fitting a Gaussian model on the chlorophyll-a profiles. The mean DCM was observed at 76 & PLUSMN; 14.5 m depth, located below the euphotic layer, estimated at 64 & PLUSMN; 2.1 m, with the water column dynamics affecting directly its depth, thickness and peak prominence. The satellite-derived chlorophyll-a, integrated within the euphotic layer, was found in fair agreement to the integrated chlorophyll-a values from surface to optical depth recorded by the glider. Chl-a at the DCM were found up to 0.60 mg m- 3, the vertically-integrated pigment content was estimated at 45 & PLUSMN; 14 mg m- 2 and the values of Optical Community Index (OCI) illustrate the dominance of small-sized plankton. The increased variability in the particulate backscattering coefficient bb700 in Thracian Sea shelf and slope deep waters seems related to sediment resuspension. CDOM levels increased from 0.76 ppb at the sea surface to 1.11 ppb at 40 m depth, being positively correlated to Chl-a within the DCM. CDOM concentration increased steadily at intermediate and deeper waters up to 1.34 & PLUSMN; 0.07 ppb. DO profiles revealed the presence of an oxycline in the DCM layer, capable to oxygenate the intermediate and deeper waters (+3 x 10-3 ml/L/m). Bottom DO in Athos basin was measured at 5.0 ml L-1, indicating that the apparent oxygen utilization in Athos Basin is approximately 50 & mu;mol L-1.

AB The long-term goal of enabling human exploration of the Moon and Mars drives International space exploration plans. Robotic space missions must therefore develop and demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the enabling technologies and capabilities.
   The Phobos Sample Return mission is a candidate mission of the Mars Robotic Exploration Preparation programme. Its objective is to acquire and return a sample from the Mars moon Phobos. The main science goal of this mission will be to understand the formation of the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos and acquire further data on the evolution of the solar system. From a technology standpoint, it would be a big step forward in the development of many technologies, ranging from low-gravity body landing capabilities to Earth re-entry of samples from deep space, from semi-autonomous robotic acquisition of surface samples to sample preservation and further analysis in dedicated ground laboratories.
   Thales Alenia Space represents one of two industrial contractors studying the mission to Phase A level. This phase involves investigation of all aspects of the mission and spacecraft design to ensure its feasibility and robustness. The planned launch date for the mission is between 2025 and 2027. The Ariane 5 ECA launch vehicle will be launched from Kourou. A chemical propulsion module will transfer the spacecraft composite to the Martian system, and will then be separated at Phobos. A full characterization campaign of Phobos at different altitudes from orbit will follow. This will include quasi-satellite orbits and flybys, using a payload suite of cameras and spectrometers. When the preferred landing site is identified, a controlled descent and touchdown onto the surface of Phobos will be performed, with a touchdown accuracy of 50 m. A robotic arm and sampling mechanism will obtain and verify a sample of surface regolith, and insert it into the Earth re-entry capsule. Part of the Spacecraft will return to the Earth from Phobos and deliver the re-entry capsule to the Earth's atmosphere. The capsule will perform a fully passive Earth entry, descent and landing in Woomera, Australia. It will then be recovered and transferred to a sample curation facility for sample extraction and analysis. This paper summarises the results of the Thales Alenia Space Phobos Sample Return mission and spacecraft design, with a focus on the key elements and mass drivers. (C) 2018 COSPAR.

AB In recent years cybersecurity attacks have caused major disruption and information loss for online organisations, with high profile incidents in the news. One of the key challenges in advancing the state of the art in intrusion detection is the lack of representative datasets. These datasets typically contain millions of time-ordered events (e.g. network packet traces, flow summaries, log entries); subsequently analysed to identify abnormal behavior and specific attacks (Duffield et al., April). Generating realistic datasets has historically required expensive networked assets, specialised traffic generators, and considerable design preparation. Even with advances in virtualisation it remains challenging to create and maintain a representative environment.
   Major improvements are needed in the design, quality and availability of datasets, to assist researchers in developing advanced detection techniques. With the emergence of new technology paradigms, such as intelligent transport and autonomous vehicles, it is also likely that new classes of threat will emerge (Kenyon, 2018 ). Given the rate of change in threat behavior (Ugarte-Pedrero et al., 2019 ) datasets become quickly obsolete, and some of the most widely cited datasets date back over two decades. Older datasets have limited value: often heavily filtered and anonymised, with unrealistic event distributions, and opaque design methodology.
   The relative scarcity of (Intrusion Detection System) IDS datasets is compounded by the lack of a central registry, and inconsistent information on provenance. Researchers may also find it hard to locate datasets or understand their relative ments. In addition, many datasets rely on simulation, originating from academic or govemment institutions. The publication process itself often creates conflicts, with the need to de-identify sensitive information in order to meet regulations such as General Data Protection Act (GDPR) (Regulation, 2016 ). Another final issue for researchers is the lack of standardised metrics with which to compare dataset quality.
   In this paper we attempt to classify the most widely used public intrusion datasets, providing references to archives and associated literature. We illustrate their relative utility and scope, highlighting the threat composition, formats, special features, and associated limitations. We identify best practice in dataset design, and describe potential pitfalls of de-signing anomaly detection techniques based on data that may be either inappropriate, or compromised due to unrealistic threat coverage. Such contributions as made in this paper is expected to facilitate continuous research and development for effectively combating the constantly evolving cyber threat landscape. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB OBJECT Accurate edge tracing segmentation remains an incompletely solved problem in brain image analysis. The authors propose a novel algorithm using a particle filter to follow the boundary of the brain in the style often used in autonomous air and ground vehicle navigation. Their goals were to create a versatile tool to segment brain and fluid in MRI and CT images of the developing brain, lay the foundation far an intelligent automated edge tracker that is modality independent, and segment normative data from MRI that can be applied to both MRI and CT.
   METHODS Simulated MRI data sets were used to train and evaluate the particle filtersegmentation algorithm. The method was then applied to produce normative growth curves for children and adolescents from 0 to 18 years of age for brain and fluid from MR images from the National Institutes of Health pediatric database and these data were compared to historical results. The authors further adapted this method for use with CT images of pediatric hydrocephalus and compared the results with hand-segmented data.
   RESULTS Segmentation of simulated MRI data with varied levels of noise (0%-9%) and spatial inhomogeneity (0%-40%) resulted in percent errors ranging from 0.06% to 5.38% for brain volume and 2.45% to 22.3% for fluid volume. The authors used this tool to create normal brain and CSF growth curves from MR images. The calculated growth curves showed excellent consistency with historical data. Additionally, compared with manual segmentation the particle filter accurately segmented brain and fluid volumes from CT scans of 5 pediatric patients with hydrocephalus (p < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS The authors have produced the first normative brain and CSF growth curves for children and adolescents 0-18 years of age. In addition, this study includes the first use of a particle filter as an edge tracker in image segmentation and offers a semiautomatic method to segment both pediatric and adult brain data from MR and CT images. The particle filter has the potential to be further automated toward a clinical rather than research tool with both of these modalities. Because of its modality independence, it has the capability to allow CT to be a more effective diagnostic tool for neurological disorders, a task of substantial importance in emergency settings and in developing countries where CT is often the only available method of brain imaging:

ID DESIGN
AB In this paper, mobile robotics and present tools used in localization, mapping, and navigation of a mobile robot are discussed. The main purpose of this paper is, given a map represented by the incidence matrix of a petri net (PN), to evaluate the use of radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology to recognize the position of a robot in this map as well as the use of the PN dynamics as the cognition system of this robot. Thus, cards with RFID technology were placed at each intersection of structured environment (labyrinth) ways. A robot equipped with an RFID reader at its bottom moves until it passes over these cards. When this happens, the vehicle performs actions, such as turning right or left according to the map defined in its algorithm. Once the above-mentioned actions are performed, it goes straight to the next card. To ensure that this happens, there is a black line connecting each card to its neighbor cards. The robot is equipped with three infrared sensors, so it can detect and follow these lines. The results show that the robot can get out of one RFID card and reach the next one since they are connected by a black line. Without these lines, due to the limitations in the structure of the robot, it loses its way and cannot return. Still, the robot is able to execute the necessary navigation movements, in the case of stopping, moving forward, and turning right and left. These movements are correctly coordinated by the PN dynamics. The robot knows which card it is on and goes to the next card according to the previously established map. Each path of the robot is mathematically modeled by the incidence matrix of a petri net. Therefore, it managed to reach the destination in each of the four proposed paths. The PN that represents path 1 has the same number of places and transitions and has curves only to the left. On path 2, a right turn was added. In path 3, besides the two-way curves, RP has more places than transitions. Lastly, in path 4, there is a crossing in the path, that is, the robot goes through the same card twice, making the right and different decisions in each case according to the respective maps. Experimental results show that this approach has feasibility and effectiveness.

AB One of the difficult tasks in coastal oceanography is to study land-sea interactions with their high levels of space and time variations. Consequences of the combination of several factors such as the climate of upstream and its influence upon the rate of freshwater inputs, coastal current regime and the annual rhythm of seawater and local meteorological conditions at small and large scales. Recent measurement technologies (e.g, moorings, towed vehicles, gliders, floaters, drifters) are now in use and can be deployed in time-series observation but they are quite expensive and not adapted for most of the coastal oceanographic research laboratories. We present here the details of a simple and relatively low-cost in-situ continuous recording system for monitoring coastal marine and estuarine surface waters. It is composed of a multiparameter probe coupled to ship-independent portable GPS. The sensors can be either towed or immersed in onboard reservoir, continuously filled with running seawater from the ship line or independent pumping device. The synchronous data acquisition allows precise location at various pre-identified time-space intervals following the sampling strategy. The system presents both novelty and great versatility of applications, it is portable and can be shore-based or deployed in almost all types of embarkation (outboard motor rubber boat, fishing and leisure boats and oceanographic research vessels). It is autonomous, easy to handle, independent of shipboard hardware and can provide precise datasheets and real-time simultaneous display. At fixed points, the system can be transformed into a CTD to perform vertical profiles down to 60 m and recording intervals can also be modified. It provides real-time surface water hydrological data at high frequency resolution (1 rec./min or 1 rec./250 m), mesospace scale (10 to 50 km). This recording system was applied, at a semi-monthly frequency (SORCOM time-series) from October 1995 to October 1998 (a time-series which is "yet active" in 2001), in the Mediterranean coastal waters influenced by the Rhone River, using 17 m-oceanographic research vessel. Strategy, results and some examples of other applications of the system are discussed here from an instrumental point of view for future application in time-series observation on land-sea interactions.

AB Ecdysis, transformation from juvenile to adult form in insects, is time-consuming and leaves insects vulnerable to predation. For winged insects, the process of wing expansion during ecdysis, unfurling and expanding the wings, is a critical bottleneck in achieving sexual maturity. Internal and external forces play a role in wing expansion. Vigorous abdominal pumping during wing expansion allows insects to pressurize and inflate their wings, filling them with hemolymph. In addition, many insects adopt expansion-specific postures and, if inhibited, do not expand their wings normally, suggesting that external forces such as gravity may play a role. However, two previous studies over 40 years ago, reported that the forewings of swarming locusts can expand autonomously when removed from the emerging insect and laid flat on a saline solution. Termed "autoexpansion," we replicated previous experiments of autoexpansion on flat liquid media, documenting changes in both wing length and area over time while also focusing on the role of gravity in autoexpansion. Using the North American bird grasshopper Schistocerca americana, we tested four autoexpansion treatments of varying surface tension and hydrophobicity (gravity, deionized water, buffer, and mineral oil) while simultaneously observing and measuring intact, normal wing expansion. Finally, we constructed a simple model of a viscoelastic expanding wing subjected to gravity, to determine whether it could capture aspects of wing expansion. Our data confirmed that wing autoexpansion does occur in S. americana, but autoexpanding wings, especially hindwings, failed to increase to the same final length and area as intact wings. We found that gravity plays an important role in wing expansion, early in the expansion process. Combined with the significant mass increase we documented in intact wings, it suggests that hydraulic pumping of hemolymph into the wings plays an important role in increasing the area of expanding wings, especially in driving expansion of the large, pleated hindwings. Autoexpansion in a non-swarming orthopteran suggests that local cues driving wing autoexpansion may serve a broader purpose, reducing total expansion time and costs by shifting some processes from central to local control. Documenting wing autoexpansion in a widely studied model organism and demonstrating a mathematical model provides a tractable new system for exploring higher level questions about the mechanisms of wing expansion and the implications of autoexpansion, as well as potential bioinspiration for future technologies applicable to micro-air vehicles, space exploration, or medical and prosthetic devices.

AB Formation of intermediate waters in the northern Red Sea was captured by Seagliders during the winter of 2016. The analysis is based on measurements collected by consequent deployments of Seaglider autonomous underwater vehicles along a 70 km transect, which was run repeatedly from the coast to midbasin during the period from October 2015 to May 2016. The observations revealed typical open ocean convection processes including a preconditioning phase followed by deep convection and spreading of the newly formed waters through lateral exchange. Winter conditions were characterized by surface cooling and enhanced evaporation, which were observed from late October until late February. During this period, the gradual surface cooling and salinity increase resulted in the weakening of the surface stratification. Recurrent cyclonic gyres forced by strong atmospheric events led to episodic convection and the formation of intermediate seawater typical of the upper overturning circulation cell of the Red Sea. Following deep mixing, a remarkable bloom of chlorophyll was detected at the top layer of the water column in response to the nutrients delivery from the deeper layers. The end of winter was marked by the intrusion of lower salinity water presumably advected from the south and the reestablishment of the general cyclonic circulation, typical for the northernmost part of the Red Sea. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first observation study of such convection events in the northern Red Sea.
   Plain Language Summary Water formation in the northern Red Sea during winter plays an important role in the basin's overturning circulation. Dense hypersaline water formed in the northern parts of the basin travels at intermediate depths towards the south and finally exits into the Indian Ocean. We describe for the first time a mechanism for the intermediate water formation, which was deduced from Seaglider records captured during the winter of 2016. We present the response of the upper seawater column to episodic atmospheric forcing events and the crucial role of cyclonic gyres in the convection process. During the period of observations, several events with simultaneous activation of the cyclonic gyre favored the winter surface cooling and led to open ocean convection. Vertical mixing in the water column supplied the near surface layer with nutrients, which caused a remarkable chlorophyll bloom. The deep mixing events occurred over very short periods, typically less than a week, and were followed by rapid restratification of the surface layer.

AB FOR COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS, bandwidth has long been king. With every generation of fiber optic, cellular, or Wi-Fi technology has come a jump in throughput that has enriched our online lives. Twenty years ago we were merely exchanging texts on our phones, but we now think nothing of streaming videos from YouTube and Netflix. No wonder, then, that video now consumes up to 60 percent of Internet bandwidth. If this trend continues, we might yet see full-motion holography delivered to our mobiles-a techie dream since Princess Leia's plea for help in Star Wars. center dot Recently, though, high bandwidth has begun to share the spotlight with a different metric of merit: low latency. The amount of latency varies drastically depending on how far in a network a signal travels, how many routers it passes through, whether it uses a wired or wireless connection, and so on. The typical latency in a 4G network, for example, is 50 milliseconds. Reducing latency to 10 milliseconds, as 5G and Wi-Fi are currently doing, opens the door to a whole slew of applications that high bandwidth alone cannot. With virtual-reality headsets, for example, a delay of more than about 10 milliseconds in rendering and displaying images in response to head movement is very perceptible, and it leads to a disorienting experience that is for some akin to seasickness. center dot Multiplayer games, autonomous vehicles, and factory robots also need extremely low latencies. Even as 5G and Wi-Fi make 10 milliseconds the new standard for latency, researchers, like my group at New York University's NYU Wireless research center, are already working hard on another order-of-magnitude reduction, to about 1 millisecond or less. center dot Pushing latencies down to 1 millisecond will require reengineering every step of the communications process. In the past, engineers have ignored sources of minuscule delay because they were inconsequential to the overall latency. Now, researchers will have to develop new methods for encoding, transmitting, and routing data to shave off even the smallest sources of delay. And immutable laws of physics-specifically the speed of light-will dictate firm restrictions on what networks with 1-millisecond latencies will look like. There's no one-size-fits-all technique that will enable these extremely low-latency networks. Only by combining solutions to all these sources of latency will it be possible to build networks where time is never wasted.

AB Purpose - This paper aims to focus on real-world mobile systems, and thus propose relevant contribution to the special issue on "Real-world mobile robot systems". This work on 3D laser semantic mobile mapping and particle filter localization dedicated for robot patrolling urban sites is elaborated with a focus on parallel computing application for semantic mapping and particle filter localization. The real robotic application of patrolling urban sites is the goal; thus, it has been shown that crucial robotic components have reach high Technology Readiness Level (TRL).
   Design/methodology/approach - Three different robotic platforms equipped with different 3D laser measurement system were compared. Each system provides different data according to the measured distance, density of points and noise; thus, the influence of data into final semantic maps has been compared. The realistic problem is to use these semantic maps for robot localization; thus, the influence of different maps into particle filter localization has been elaborated. A new approach has been proposed for particle filter localization based on 3D semantic information, and thus, the behavior of particle filter in different realistic conditions has been elaborated. The process of using proposed robotic components for patrolling urban site, such as the robot checking geometrical changes of the environment, has been detailed.
   Findings - The focus on real-world mobile systems requires different points of view for scientific work. This study is focused on robust and reliable solutions that could be integrated with real applications. Thus, new parallel computing approach for semantic mapping and particle filter localization has been proposed. Based on the literature, semantic 3D particle filter localization has not yet been elaborated; thus, innovative solutions for solving this issue have been proposed. Recently, a semantic mapping framework that was already published was developed. For this reason, this study claimed that the authors' applied studies during real-world trials with such mapping system are added value relevant for this special issue.
   Research limitations/implications - The main problem is the compromise between computer power and energy consumed by heavy calculations, thus our main focus is to use modern GPGPU, NVIDIA PASCAL parallel processor architecture. Recent advances in GPGPUs shows great potency for mobile robotic applications, thus this study is focused on increasing mapping and localization capabilities by improving the algorithms. Current limitation is related with the number of particles processed by a single processor, and thus achieved performance of 500 particles in real-time is the current limitation. The implication is that multi-GPU architectures for increasing the number of processed particle can be used. Thus, further studies are required.
   Practical implications - The research focus is related to real-world mobile systems; thus, practical aspects of the work are crucial. The main practical application is semantic mapping that could be used for many robotic applications. The authors claim that their particle filter localization is ready to integrate with real robotic platforms using modern 3D laser measurement system. For this reason, the authors claim that their system can improve existing autonomous robotic platforms. The proposed components can be used for detection of geometrical changes in the scene; thus, many practical functionalities can be applied such as: detection of cars, detection of opened/closed gate, etc. [...] These functionalities are crucial elements of the safe and security domain.
   Social implications - Improvement of safe and security domain is a crucial aspect of modern society. Protecting critical infrastructure plays an important role, thus introducing autonomous mobile platforms capable of supporting human operators of safe and security systems could have a positive impact if viewed from many points of view.
   Originality/value - This study elaborates the novel approach of particle filter localization based on 3D data and semantic mapping. This original work could have a great impact on the mobile robotics domain, and thus, this study claims that many algorithmic and implementation issues were solved assuming real-task experiments. The originality of this work is influenced by the use of modern advanced robotic systems being a relevant set of technologies for proper evaluation of the proposed approach. Such a combination of experimental hardware and original algorithms and implementation is definitely an added value.

AB Consider a sensor that reports whether or not an event has occurred somewhere along a path, but that has no conception of where along the path that event has occurred. We name this type of sensor a path-based sensor and describe the recursive Bayesian update that can be used to calculate posterior beliefs about the presence of a sensor triggering phenomenon given a path-based sensor observation. We show how the Bayesian update can be leveraged to calculate the expected Shannon information that will be gained along a particular path. We formalize two iterative information-gathering problems that result from this scenario and present path-planning algorithms to solve them. These include: 1) gathering information about the path-based sensor triggering phenomena and 2) assuming the path-based sensor triggering event is "robot destruction," simultaneously gather information about: 1) hazards using a path-based sensor and 2) information about another environmental phenomenon using a standard sensor, such as the locations of search and rescue targets with a camera. We evaluate our methods using Monte Carlo simulations and observe that they outperform other techniques with respect to the new problems that we consider. Note to Practitioners-This work is motivated by the problem of searching for robot-destroying hazards that are otherwise invisible to the robots. That is, we can observe whether or not a robot survives a path, but, if a robot is destroyed, then we have no idea where, along the path, its destruction has occurred. A mathematically equivalent problem happens in any scenario, in which an agent is equipped with an event sensor that can only be set/triggered once, but that requires postprocessing to figure out if the sensor has been triggered or not. For example, postprocessing is needed if the determination of whether or not a biological specimen was obtained requires a manual laboratory inspection. We also consider an extension of the hazard detection problem, in which we simultaneously collect information about search-and-rescue victims using a "victim sensor," such as a camera. In this problem, hazards indirectly affect information gathered about victims because new information about victims is lost whenever a robot is destroyed. We provide algorithms to solve these types of problems. The algorithms work even in cases with noise such that false positives and false negatives are possible. This work is useful in any application where observations take the form of a cumulative "yes" or "no" along a path.

AB Submarine mud volcanoes develop through the extrusion of methane-rich fluids and sediments onto the seafloor. The morphology of a mud volcano can record its extrusive history and processes of erosion and deformation affecting it. The study of offshore mud volcano dynamics is limited because only few have been mapped at resolutions that reveal their detailed surface structures. More importantly, rates and volumes of extruded sediment and methane are poorly constrained. The 100 m high twin cones of Venere mud volcano are situated at approximate to 1,600 m water depth within Squillace Canyon along the Ionian Calabrian margin, Mediterranean Sea. Seafloor bathymetry and backscatter data obtained by a ship-based system and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) allow mapping of mudflow deposits of the mud volcano and bedforms in the surrounding canyon. Repeated surveying by AUV document active mud movement at the western summit in between 2014 and 2016. Through sediment coring and tephrochronology, ages of buried mudflow deposits are determined based on the sedimentation rate and the thickness of overlying hemipelagic sediments. An average extrusion rate of 27,000 m(3)/yr over the last approximate to 882 years is estimated. These results support a three-stage evolutionary model of Venere mud volcano since approximate to 4,000 years ago. It includes the onset of quiescence at the eastern cone (after approximate to 2,200 years ago), erosive events in Squillace Canyon (prior to approximate to 882 years ago), and mudflows from the eastern cone (since approximate to 882 years). This study reveals new interactions between a mud volcano and a canyon in the deep sea.
   Plain Language Summary Mud volcanoes are geological structures that can release large amounts of gas (methane) and sediments. Mud volcanoes are well studied on land but on the seafloor, where they are much more common, the volumes of released sediments and methane are poorly known. In this study, the evolution of an active submarine mud volcano is investigated by using sediment cores and an exceptionally detailed seafloor map. The ages of different mud outflow deposits are determined by measuring the amount of marine background sediments that have accumulated on top of them. Volumes of sediment, extruded by the mud volcano, are estimated based on the seafloor map and the combination of all results allows to calculate an average extrusion rate of the mudflows. This study highlights the value of detailed seafloor mapping to gain new insights and to quantify fundamental geological processes occurring at mud volcanoes on the seafloor.

AB The advancement of innovative underwater remote sensing detection and imaging methods, such as continuous wave laser line scan or pulsed laser (i.e., LiDAR-Light Detection and Ranging) imaging approaches can provide novel solutions for studying biological substrates and manmade objects/surfaces often encountered in underwater coastal environments. Such instruments can be used shipboard or coupled with proven and available deployment platforms as AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles). With the right planning, large areas can be surveyed, and more extreme and difficult-to-reach environments can be studied. A prime example, and representing a certain navigational challenge, is the under ice in the Arctic/Antarctic or winter/polar environments or deep underwater survey. Among many marine biological substrates, numerous species of macroalgae can be found worldwide in shallow down to 70+ m (clear water) coastal habitats and are essential ecosystem service providers through the habitat they provide for other species, the potential food resource value, and carbon sink they represent. Similarly, corals also provide important ecosystem services through their structure and diversity, are found to harbor increased local diversity, and are equally valid targets as "keystone" species. Hence, we expand current underwater remote sensing methods to combine macroalgal and coral surveys via the development of a multispectral laser serial imager designed for classification via spectral response. By using multiple continuous wave laser wavelength sources to scan and illuminate recreated benthic environments composed of macroalgae and coral, we show how elastic (i.e., reflectance) and inelastic (i.e., fluorescence) spectral responses can potentially be used to differentiate algal color groups and certain coral genus. Experimentally, three laser diodes (450 nm, 490 nm, 520 nm) are sequentially used in conjunction with up to 5 emission filters (450 nm, 490 nm, 520 nm, 580 nm, 685 nm) to acquire images generated by laser line scan pattern via high-speed galvanometric mirrors. Placed directly adjacent to a large saltwater imaging tank fitted with optical viewports, the optical system records target substrate spectral response using a photomultiplier preceded by a filter and is synchronously digitized to the scan rate by a high sample rate Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). Acquired images are normalized to correct for imager optical effects allowing for fluorescence intensity-based pixel segmentation via intensity thresholding. Overall, the multispectral laser serial imaging technique shows that the resulting high resolution data can be used for detection and classification of benthic substrates by their spectral response. These methods highlight a path towards eventual pixel-wise spectral response analysis for spectral differentiation.

AB The northernmost segment of the Gorda mid-ocean ridge is the site of a small-volume eruption in 1996 and the persistent off-axis Sea Cliff hydrothermal vent field. To better understand the geologic setting and formation of these features, 1-m resolution bathymetric mapping using autonomous underwater vehicles was completed in 2016. The mapped region covers 35 km(2) and 15.6 km of the volcanic axis from south of the 1996 lava flows, and a cross section for similar to 4.5 km perpendicular to the axis, that extends beyond the Sea Cliff hydrothermal vent field. A proposed 1996 flow similar to 7 km south of previously mapped flows is an artifact from a poor pre-eruption survey. The 1996 flows consist of three discrete steep hummocky mounds of pillows and syneruptive talus. The Sea Cliff hydrothermal field is located a few km north of the narrowest, shallowest section of the ridge segment, 2.6 km east of the center of the neovolcanic zone, and similar to 370 m above the average depth of the axial graben on the largest offset ridge-parallel fault. No evidence supports the prior hypothesis that the site is located where two fault systems intersect. The axial graben is asymmetrical with larger fault offsets on the east side. The ridge axis below the hydrothermal field and to the south toward the 1996 flows is constructed dominantly of hummocky flows of pillow basalt, many unusually steep-sided, with syneruptive talus at the base of their steep slopes. Three channelized flows ponded between steep hummocky flows, and then partially drained. Some low-eruption-rate hummocky flows and high-eruption-rate channelized flows have nearly identical compositions, supporting the idea that eruption rates on mid-ocean ridges vary because of different dike widths. Four volcanic structures with volumes between 0.18 and 0.25 km(3) occur in the axial graben south of the 1996 flows. Two are flat-topped cones, another is a 1.5-km diameter inflated hummocky flow with 7 pit craters that demonstrate that the flow had a molten interior during growth. The fourth voluminous structure is a steep ridge with abundant syneruptive talus on its lower slopes. The North Gorda segment is an end-member, structurally and volcanically, compared with other Pacific intermediate-rate spreading ridges.

AB Hurricane Sandy (2012) was the second costliest tropical cyclone to impact the United States and resulted in numerous lives lost due to its high winds and catastrophic storm surges. Despite its impacts little research has been performed on the circulation on the continental shelf as Sandy made landfall. In this study, integrated ocean observing assets and regional ocean modeling were used to investigate the coastal ocean response to Sandy's large wind field. Sandy's unique cross-shelf storm track, large size, and slow speed resulted in along-shelf wind stress over the coastal ocean for nearly 48 h before the eye made landfall in southern New Jersey. Over the first inertial period (similar to 18 h), this along-shelf wind stress drove onshore flow in the surface of the stratified continental shelf and initiated a two-layer downwelling circulation. During the remaining storm forcing period a bottom Ekman layer developed and the bottom Cold Pool was rapidly advected offshore similar to 70 km. This offshore advection removed the bottom Cold Pool from the majority of the shallow continental shelf and limited ahead-of-eye-center sea surface temperature (SST) cooling, which has been observed in previous storms on the MAB such as Hurricane Irene (2011). This cross-shelf advective process has not been observed previously on continental shelves during tropical cyclones and highlights the need for combined ocean observing systems and regional modeling in order to further understand the range of coastal ocean responses to tropical cyclones.
   Plain Language Summary Hurricane Sandy (2012) was the second costliest tropical cyclone to impact the United States and resulted in numerous lives lost due to its high winds and catastrophic storm surges. Despite its impacts little research has been performed on the circulation of the coastal ocean as Sandy made landfall. In this study integrated ocean observing assets and regional ocean modeling were used to investigate the coastal ocean response to Sandy's large wind field. Sandy's unique cross-shelf storm track, large size, and slow speed resulted in powerful alongshore winds over the coastal ocean for nearly 48 h before the eye made landfall in southern New Jersey. These winds transported cold bottom waters offshore and left the coastal ocean uniformly warm and mixed. This circulation pattern has not been observed previously during tropical cyclones and highlights the need for a continued focus on coastal ocean observing systems and numerical modeling during storm events.

AB Seafloor drill rigs are remotely operated systems that provide a cost-effective means to recover sedimentary records of the upper sub-seafloor deposits. Recent increases in their payload included downhole logging tools or autoclave coring systems. Here we report on another milestone in using seafloor rigs: the development and installation of shallow borehole observatories.
   Three different systems have been developed for the MARUM-MeBo (Meeresboden-Bohrgerat) seafloor drill, which is operated by MARUM, University of Bremen, Germany. A simple design, the MeBoPLUG, separates the inner borehole from the overlying ocean by using o-ring seals at the conical threads of the drill pipe. The systems are self-contained and include data loggers, batteries, thermistors and a differential pressure sensor. A second design, the so-called MeBoCORK (Circulation Obviation Retrofit Kit), is more sophisticated and also hosts an acoustic modem for data transfer and, if desired, fluid sampling capability using osmotic pumps. In these MeBoCORKs, two systems have to be distinguished: the CORK-A (A stands for autonomous) can be installed by the MeBo alone and monitors pressure and temperature inside and above the borehole (the latter for reference); the CORK-B (B stands for bottom) has a higher payload and can additionally be equipped with geochemical, biological or other physical components. Owing to its larger size, it is installed by a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) and utilises a hot-stab connection in the upper portion of the drill string. Either design relies on a hot-stab connection from beneath in which coiled tubing with a conical drop weight is lowered to couple to the formation. These tubes are fluid-saturated and either serve to transmit pore pressure signals or collect porewater in the osmo-sampler. The third design, the MeBoPUPPI (Pop-UpPore Pressure Instrument), is similar to the MeBoCORK-A and monitors pore pressure and temperature in a self-contained manner. Instead of transferring data on command using an acoustic modem, the MeBoPUPPI contains a pop-up telemetry with iridium link. After a predefined period, the data unit with satellite link is released, ascends to the sea surface, and remains there for up to 2 weeks while sending the long-term data sets to shore.
   In summer 2012, two MeBoPLUGs, one MeBoCORK-A and one MeBoCORK-B were installed with MeBo on RV Sonne, Germany, in the Nankai Trough area, Japan. We have successfully downloaded data from the CORKs, attesting that coupling to the formation worked, and pressure records were elevated relative to the seafloor reference. In the near future, we will further deploy the first two MeBoPUPPIs. Recovery of all monitoring systems by a ROV is planned for 2016.

AB The stable, persistent, active lava lake at Erebus volcano (Ross Island, Antarctica) provides an excellent thermal target for analysis of spacecraft observations, and for testing new technology. In the austral summer of 2005 visible and infrared observations of the Erebus lava lake were obtained with sensors on three space vehicles Terra (ASTER, MODIS), Aqua (MODIS) and EO-1 (Hyperion, ALI). Contemporaneous ground-based observations were obtained with hand-held infrared cameras. This allowed a quantitative comparison of the thermal data obtained from different instruments, and of the analytical techniques used to analyze the data, both with and without the constraints imposed by ground-truth. From the thermal camera data, in December 2005 the main Erebus lava lake (Ray Lake) had an area of approximate to 820 m(2). Surface colour temperatures ranged from 575 K to 1090 K, with a broad peak in the distribution from 730 K to 850 K. Total heat loss was estimated at 23.5 MW. The flux density was approximate to 29 kW m(-2). Mass flux was estimated at 64 to 93 kg s(-1). The best correlation between thermal emission and emitting area was obtained with ASTER, which has the best combination of spatial resolution and wavelength coverage, especially in the thermal infrared. The high surface temperature of the lava lake means that Hyperion data are for the most part saturated. Uncertainties, introduced by the need to remove incident sunlight cause the thermal emission from the Hyperion data to be a factor of about two greater than that measured by hand-held thermal camera. MODIS also over-estimated thermal output from the lava lake by the same factor of two because it was detecting reflected sunlight from the rest of the pixel area. The measurement of the detailed temperature distribution on the surface of an active terrestrial lava lake will allow testing of thermal emission models used to interpret remote-sensing data of volcanism on lo, where no such ground-truth exists. Although the Erebus lava lake is four orders of magnitude smaller than the lava lake at Pele on lo, the shape of the integrated thermal emission spectra are similar. Thermal emission from this style of effusive volcanism appears to be invariant. Excess thermal emission in most Pele spectra (compared to Erebus) at short wavelengths (<3 mu m) is most likely due to disruption of the surface on the lava lake by escaping volatiles.

TI Fusing Multiple Isolated Maps to Visual Inertial Odometry Online: A
   Consistent Filter
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING

DE Visual-inertial odometry; consistency; map-based localization
ID EXTENDED KALMAN FILTER; IMPROVEMENT; NAVIGATION; VINS
AB Visual inertial odometry (VIO) is widely used in various kinds of mobile platforms to provide the ego-pose of the platforms. With the help of pre-built map information, the drift of the VIO can be constrained. However, constructing a globally consistent map is a tough job, especially for large scenes. In this paper, we propose a filter-based framework aiming to leverage multiple isolated maps to improve the performance of VIO such that building a globally consistent map can be avoided. In this framework, the relative transformations between the local VIO reference frame and the multiple map reference frames are regarded as 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) pose features to be online estimated. We call these relative transformations as augmented variables. With these augmented variables, the map-based information can be tightly coupled into the VIO system to ease the drift of VIO. To fuse these maps consistently, we first theoretically analyze the observability properties of our proposed framework. Based on the analysis, the Schmidt extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the first-estimate Jacobian (FEJ) are employed to maintain the consistency of the system. Simulation and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and consistency of our framework.
   Note to Practitioners-Visual inertial odometry (VIO) is widely applied to positioning mobile platforms including autonomous vehicles, robots, and virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) devices. However, VIO inevitably suffers from drift, which will reduce positioning accuracy. This problem can be solved by fusing prior maps into VIO. Existing works mainly support online fusing one map into VIO. This requires users to offline merge multiple maps into one beforehand, which is complicated and troublesome and sometimes even unrealizable (e.g., the multiple maps have no overlap). According to theoretical analyses, this paper introduces a new system that can online fuse multiple maps into VIO. Our system has the following benefits: 1) It is a light-weighted filter-based system suitable for onboard deployments; 2) It can online fuse multiple maps such that pre-work of merging multiple maps into one can be bypassed; 3) Our system can consistently fuse the multi-map information while keeps the computation at a low level. Experiments show that with our system, the VIO's drift can be significantly alleviated to benefit downstream tasks like planning, navigation, and control. However, our system needs to fix some linearization points to maintain the correct observability of the system, which will sacrifice some precision. Future works will include investigating more elegant techniques to maintain the observability of the system.

AB Background: Multiple nations are actively pursuing manned exploration of space beyond low-earth orbit. The responsibility to improve surgical care for spaceflight is substantial. Although the use of parabolic flight as a terrestrial analogue to study surgery in weightlessness (0g) is well described, minimal data is available to guide the appropriate delivery of anesthesia. After studying anesthetized pigs in a 0g parabolic flight environment, our group developed a comprehensive protocol describing prolonged anesthesia in a parabolic flight analogue space surgery study (PFASSS). Novel challenges included a physically remote vivarium, prolonged (>10 h) anesthetic requirements, and the provision of veterinary operating room/intensive care unit (ICU) equivalency on-board an aircraft with physical dimensions of <1.5 m(2) (Falcon 20). Identification of an effective anesthetic regime is particularly important because inhalant anesthesia cannot be used in-flight.
   Methods: After ethical approval, multiple ground laboratory sessions were conducted with combinations of anesthetic, pre-medication, and induction protocols on Yorkshire-cross specific pathogen-free (SPF) pigs. Several constant rate infusion (CRI) intravenous anesthetic combinations were tested. In each regimen, opioids were administered to ensure analgesia. Ventilation was supported mechanically with blended gradients of oxygen. The best performing terrestrial 1 g regime was flight tested in parabolic flight for its effectiveness in sustaining optimal and prolonged anesthesia, analgesia, and maintaining hemodynamic stability. Each flight day, a fully anesthetized, ventilated, and surgically instrumented pig was transported to the Flight Research Laboratory (FRL) in a temperature-controlled animal ambulance. A modular on-board surgical/ICU suite with appropriate anesthesia/ICU and surgical support capabilities was employed.
   Results: The mean duration of anesthesia (per flight day) was 10.28 h over four consecutive days. A barbiturate and ketamine-based CRI anesthetic regimen supplemented with narcotic analgesia by bolus administration offered the greatest prolonged hemodynamic stability through an IV route (within multiple transport vehicles and differing gravitational environments). Standardization and prepackaging of anesthesia, emergency pharmaceuticals, and consumables were found to facilitate the interchange of the veterinary anesthesia team members between flights. This operational process was extremely challenging.
   Conclusions: With careful organization of caregivers, equipment and protocols, providing anesthesia and life support in weightlessness is theoretically possible. Unfortunately, human resource costs are extensive and likely overwhelming. Comprehensive algorithms for extended spaceflight must recognize these costs prior to making assumptions or attempting to provide critical care in space. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, many concepts in technology has been changed. According to the digital transformation trends, Internet of Things (IoT) represents an interested research issue. As the IoT grows, the data and the processes will need more space. The data in cases like healthcare, smart cities, autonomous vehicles, smart agriculture, etc. needs to be analyzed and processed in real-time. Cisco refers to the dependence of edge and cloud as "The Fog". The data can be analyzed at the fog layer to maximize data utilization. This paper presents a new Effective Prediction and Resource Allocation Methodology (EPRAM) for Fog environment, which is suitable for Healthcare applications. Resource Allocation (RA) represents a hard mission as it involves a set of various resources and fog nodes to achieve the required computations for IoT systems. EPRAM tries to achieve effective resource management in Fog environment via real-time resource allocating as well as prediction algorithm. EPRAM is composed of three main modules, namely: (i) Data Preprocessing Module (DPM), (ii) Resource Allocation Module (RAM) and (ii) Effective Prediction Module (EPM). The EPM uses the PNN to predict a target field, using one or more predictors. In order to detect the probability of the heart attack, PNN is trained using the training dataset. Then PNN will be tested using the user's sensing data coming from the IoT layer to predict the probability of heart attack and then take the most appropriate action accordingly. The main goal of the system is to achieve a low latency while improving the Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as (the allocation cost, the response time, bandwidth efficiency and energy consumption). Unlike other RA techniques, EPRAM employs deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm in a new manner. It also uses the PNN for the prediction algorithm. It has achieved such acceptable performance due to using deep RL and PNN. Deep RL has shown impressive promises in resource allocation. PNN generates accurate predicted target and is much faster than multilayer perceptron networks. Comparing the EPRAM with the state-of-the-art algorithms, EPRAM achieved the minimum Makespan as compared to previous LB algorithms, while maximizing the Average Resource Utilization (ARU) and the Load Balancing Level (LBL). Accordingly, EPRAM is a suitable algorithm in the case of real-time systems in FC which leads to load balancing. ERAM is effective in monitoring and predicting the status of the patient accurately and quickly.

AB Current estimates indicate that the number of high-temperature vents (one of the primary pathways for the heat extraction from the Earth's mantle) - at least 1 per 100 km of axial length - scales with spreading rate and should scale with crustal thickness. But up to present, shallow ridge axes underlain by thick crust show anomalously low incidences of high-temperature activity. Here we compare the Reykjanes Ridge, an abnormally shallow ridge with thick crust and only one high-temperature vent known over 900 km axial length, to the adjacent subaerial Reykjanes Peninsula (RP), which is characterized by high-temperature geothermal sites confined to four volcanic systems transected by fissure swarms with young (Holocene) volcanic activity, multiple faults, cracks and fissures, and continuous seismic activity. New high-resolution bathymetry (gridded at 60 m) of the Reykjanes Ridge between 62 degrees 30'N and 63 degrees 30'N shows seven Axial Volcanic Ridges (AVR) that, based on their morphology, geometry and tectonic regime, are analogues for the volcanic systems and fissure swarms on land. We investigate in detail the volcano-tectonic features of all mapped AVRs and show that they do not fit with the previously suggested 4-stage evolution model for AVR construction. Instead, we suggest that AVR morphology reflects the robust or weak melt supply to the system and two (or more) eruption mechanisms may co-exist on one AVR (in contrast to 4-stage evolution model). Our interpretations indicate that, unlike on the Reykjanes Peninsula, faults on and around AVRs do not cluster in orientation domains but all are subparallel to the overall strike of AVRs (orthogonal to spreading direction). High abundance of seamounts shows that the region centered at 62 degrees 47'N and 25 degrees 04'W (between AVR-5 and -6) is volcanically robust while the highest fault density implies that AVR-1 and southern part of AVR-6 rather undergo period of melt starvation. Based on our observations and interpretations we expect all of the AVRs on Reykjanes Ridge to be hydrothermally active but morphological and hydrographic settings of this ridge may cause hydrothermal plumes to be quickly dispersed and diluted due to exposure to strong bottom currents. Therefore, combined CTD and autonomous vehicles surveys are probably the most efficient methods for hydrothermal exploration along the Reykjanes Ridge. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The albatross optimized flight maneuver-known as dynamic soaring-is nothing but a wonder of biology, physics, and engineering. By utilizing dynamic soaring, this fascinating bird can travel in the desired flight direction almost for free by harvesting energy from the wind. This phenomenon has been observed for centuries as evidenced by the writings of Leonardo da Vinci and Lord Rayleigh. Moreover, dynamic soaring biological inspiration has triggered a momentous interest among many communities of science and engineering, particularly aeronautical, control, and robotic engineering communities. That is, if dynamic soaring is mimicked, we will have arrived at a new class of unmanned aerial vehicles that are very energy-efficient during part (or the full) duration of their flight. Studying, modeling, and simulating dynamic soaring have been conducted in literature by mostly configuring dynamic soaring as an optimal control problem. Said configuration requires accurate dynamic system modeling of the albatross/mimicking-object, accurate wind profile models, and a defined mathematical formula of an objective function that aims at conserving energy and minimizing its dissipation; the solution then of such optimal control problem is the dynamic soaring trajectory taken-or to be taken-by the bird/mimicking-object. Furthermore, the decades-long optimal control configuration of the dynamic soaring problem resulted in non-real-time algorithms and control solutions, which may not be aligned well with the biological phenomenon itself; experimental observations of albatrosses indicate their ability to conduct dynamic soaring in real-time. Indeed, a functioning modeling and control framework for dynamic soaring that allows for a meaningful bio-mimicry of the albatross needs to be autonomous, real-time, stable, and capable of tolerating the absence of mathematical expressions of the wind profiles and the objective function-hypothetically similar to what the bird does. The qualifications of such modeling and control framework are the very same characteristics of the so-called extremum seeking systems. In this paper, we show that extremum seeking systems existing in control literature for decades are a natural characterization of the dynamic soaring problem. We propose an extremum seeking modeling and control framework for the dynamic soaring problem hypothesizing that the introduced framework captures more features of the biological phenomenon itself and allows for possible bio-mimicking of it. We provide and discuss the problem setup, design, and stability of the introduced framework. Our results, supported by simulations and comparison with optimal control methods of the literature, provide a proof of concept that the dynamic soaring phenomenon can be a natural expression of extremum seeking. Hence, dynamic soaring has the potential to be performed autonomously and in real-time with stability guarantees.

AB Car occupants account for one third of all junction fatalities in the European Union. Driver warning can reduce intersection accidents by up to 50 percent; adding Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) delivers a reduction of up to 70 percent. However, these findings are based on an assumed 100 percent equipment rate, which may take decades to achieve. Our study investigates the relationship between intersection AEB market penetration rates and avoidance of accidents and injuries in order to guide implementation strategies. Additionally, residual accident characteristics (impact configurations and severity) are analyzed to provide a basis for future in-crash protection requirements.
   We determined which accidents would have been avoided through the use of an Intersection AEB system with different sensor field-of-views (180 degrees and 120 degrees) by means of re-simulating the pre-crash phase of 792 straight crossing path (SCP) car-to-car accidents recorded in the German In-Depth Accident Study (GIDAS) and the associated Pre-Crash Matrix (PCM). Intersection AEB was activated when neither of the conflict opponents could avoid the crash through reasonable braking or steering reactions. For not-avoided accidents, we used the Kudlich-Slibar rigid body impulse model to calculate the change of velocity during the impact as a measure of impact severity and the principal direction of force.
   Accident avoidance over market penetration is not linear but exponential, with higher gains at low penetration rates and lower gains at higher rates. A wide field-of-view sensor (180) substantially increased accident avoidance and injury mitigation rates compared to a 120 degrees field-of-view sensor. For a 180 degrees field-of-view sensor at 100 percent market penetration, about 80 percent of the accidents and 90 percent of the MAIS2 + F injuries could be avoided. For the remaining accidents, AEB intervention rarely affected side of impact. The median change of velocity (delta-V) of the remaining crashes reduces only marginally at low penetration rates but this reduction increases with higher penetration rates. With 100 percent market penetration, one quarter of the vehicles still involved in straight crossing path accidents will sustain a delta-V higher than 17km/h.
   Intersection AEB is very effective. Enabling a fast initial implementation of systems with wide field-of-view sensor(s) and ensuring a high market penetration over the longer term is essential to achieve high crash avoidance and injury mitigation rates over time. The standards for in-crash protection must be high to mitigate injury in the unavoidable, residual accidents.

AB There is an increasing interest in identifying potent cancer preventive and therapeutic agents against prostate cancer (PCA). In a recent study, we showed that a polyphenolic fraction isolated from grape seeds (hereafter referred to as GSP) that is substantially rich in antioxidant procyanidins exerts exceptionally high preventive effects against tumorigenesis in a murine skin model. In the present study, we investigated the anticarcinogenic effect of GSP against PCA by employing DU145 human prostate carcinoma cells. GSP treatment (10-100 mu g/mL doses for 2-6 d) of cells resulted in a highly significant (P < 0.01-0.001) inhibition of cell growth in both dose- and time-dependent manner. Compared with the vehicle, 2 d of GSP treatment resulted in 27, 39, and 76% growth inhibition at 50, 75, and 100 mu g/mL doses, respectively, whereas 28-97% and 12-98% inhibition was evident at 10-100 mu g/mL doses of GSP after 4 and 6 d of treatment, respectively. These doses of GSP also resulted in dose- and time-dependent cell death (6-50%, P < 0.1-0.001) that was later characterized as apoptotic death. In molecular mechanistic studies, treatment of DU145 cells with GSP at 25-75 mu g/mL doses for 24, 48, and 72 h resulted in 77-88%, 65-93%, and 38-98% reduction, respectively (P < 0.001), in phospho-extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) 1 and 78%, 1976%, and 63-71% reduction (P < 0.1-0.001) in phospho-ERK2 levels, respectively. In other studies, similar doses of GSP showed up to 1.9-fold increases in Cip1/p21 and a significant (P < 0.001) decrease in cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 (up to 90% decrease), CDK2 (up to 50% decrease), and cyclin E (up to 60% decrease). GSP treatment of DU145 cells also resulted in a significant (P < 0.001) G1 arrest in cell-cycle progression in a dose-dependent manner. The growth-inhibitory and cell-death effects of GSP were also observed in another human PCA line, LNCaP. Together, these results suggest that GSP may exert strong anticarcinogenic effect against PCA and that this effect possibly involves modulation of mitogenic signaling and cell-cycle regulators and induction of G1 arrest, cell-growth inhibition, and apoptotic death.

ID UNDERWATER
AB Reinforcement learning (RL) has been successfully applied to underwater routing protocols due to its powerful ability of distributed decision making. However, the traditional RL has slow convergence speed and low learning efficiency in underwater. Meanwhile, too many studies focus on using RL to find low hop paths rather than short distance paths in underwater routing, while the long distance of ocean communication is the significant reason for the packets collision and energy loss in underwater. Based on the above problems, this paper proposes the PDDQN-HHVBF (Empirical Priority DDQN to Improve Hop-by-Hop Vector-Based Forwarding) protocol for M-UWSNs (Mobile source node Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks), in which AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) is used as source node to collect data and transmit data hop-by-hop to Sink node through underwater nodes. The proposed protocol is adopt to find the optimal relay nodes in pipeline referred HHVBF protocol by requesting the max Q value according to three states of the residual energy of nodes, the number of candidate relay nodes and the geographical location information of all candidate relay nodes in time. This because PDDQN-HHVBF avoids the strong correlation between data samples, and its playback samples will not be too concentrated or lead to over fitting. It can converge rapidly in underwater environment. In addition, the requesting Q value mechanism related to the geographical location information can find the optimal relay node with short distance propagation in large-scale networks, which will reduce the number of packets collision, and then saving energy and improving network lifetime. In addtion, the in-time requesting for Q value can cope with the nodes drift affected by ocean current movement. In addition, the Q value related to the residual energy of nodes and the number of candidate relay nodes will effectively load balancing nodes, prolong network lifetime and avoid routing holes. Finally, the "Store-Carry-Forward" mechanism proposed for AUV, this mechanism store and carry packets when facing routing holes until find the optimal relay node for forwarding, which will improve PDR and save energy of AUV significantly. The simulation results show that, the proposed PDDQN-HHVBF protocol converges about 30% faster than DQELR. Although its delay is higher than DQELR and ROEVA for requesting Q value. It outperforms VBF, HHVBF, DQELR, and ROEVA in terms of energy efficency, PDR, and lifetime, which are analyzed by varying speed of nodes from 0 m/s to 3 m/s with 1000 nodes and varying number of nodes from 500 to 3000 with speed in 1 m/s.

AB CONTEXT: Automated monitoring of the soil-plant-atmospheric continuum at a high spatiotemporal resolution is a key to transform the labor-intensive, experience-based decision making to an automatic, data-driven approach in agricultural production. Growers could make better management decisions by leveraging the real-time field data while researchers could utilize these data to answer key scientific questions. Traditionally, data collection in agricultural fields, which largely relies on human labor, can only generate limited numbers of data points with low resolution and accuracy. During the last two decades, crop monitoring has drastically evolved with the advancement of modern sensing technologies. Most importantly, the introduction of IoT (Internet of Things) into crop, soil, and microclimate sensing has transformed crop monitoring into a quantitative and data-driven work from a qualitative and experience-based task. OBJECTIVE: Ag-IoT systems enable a data pipeline for modern agriculture that includes data collection, trans-mission, storage, visualization, analysis, and decision-making. This review serves as a technical guide for Ag-IoT system design and development for crop, soil, and microclimate monitoring.METHODS: It highlighted Ag-IoT platforms presented in 115 academic publications between 2011 and 2021 worldwide. These publications were analyzed based on the types of sensors and actuators used, main control boards, types of farming, crops observed, communication technologies and protocols, power supplies, and energy storage used in Ag-IoT platforms.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The result showed that 33 variables measured by various sensors were demon-strated in these studies while 10 actuations were successfully integrated with Ag-IoT platforms. Perennial crops, which introduced less disturbance to Ag-IoT platforms than annual crops, were selected by 64% of researchers. Furthermore, studies in Ag-IoT system development were more focused on outdoor than indoor environments. Ag-IoT systems based on Arduino were most common among the studies while commercial platforms were least adopted, likely due to their inflexibility in customized developments. More researchers focused on agricultural applications than the IoT technology itself. Soil water content-based irrigation scheduling and controlled envi-ronment monitoring and controlling were the main applications. Other application areas included soil nutrient estimation, crop monitoring based on multiple vegetation indices, pest identification, and chemigation. SIGNIFICANCE: Several potential future research directions were identified at the end of the review, including integration of satellite-based internet connectivity to improve the IoT networks in non-connected farms, development of mobile IoT platforms (drones and autonomous ground vehicles) with continuous connectivity, and the use of edge-computing and machine-learning/deep-learning to enhance the capability of the Ag-IoT systems.

AB The internet has made massive progress since the 1990s. The amount of traffic that crosses the Internet now is 22 million times more than what was generated in 1992. Although the fiber optic cables replaced the century-old copper cables to transmit trillions of bits per second, the end user at a local area is still hungry for more bandwidth to run new emerging applications. This put both ISPs and the mobile network operators under challenges: Are they ready for the Mammoth Internet? Will ISPs be able to offer the capacity to meet the growing demand? Is their infrastructure capable of serving the future disruptive services such as 4K/8K technology, VR/AR, autonomous vehicles, etc? The literature lacks a comprehensive study of bandwidth requirements for the end user in both fixed-access and mobile Internet. In this paper, we bridge the gap that is missing in the current literature. We provide an insightful study regarding bandwidth consumption in both fixed-access and mobile networks. We investigate bandwidth drivers in both fixed access and mobile networks and forecast the future behaviors and consumption of the end user. We Identify Internet of Things (IoT), video streaming, 4K technology, and VR/AR as potential bandwidth drivers of both fixed-access and mobile Internet. We design our models to forecast the bandwidth of both residential Internet and mobile data by 2021 and measure the contribution of each bandwidth driver to this projection. Our models include all possible types of end users and their bandwidth consumption behaviors. Our results show that video entertainment with 4K technology along with VR/AR will be the top drivers of future bandwidth, while IoT will be of least impact among them. Furthermore, we present a supporting use case to calculate the bandwidth requirements for streaming video content on regular and flagship handsets. Regarding the fixed-access Internet, our model shows that 50% of households will require <= 78 Mbps, 12% of households will require between 78 and 100 Mbps, and nearly 5% will require >= 500 Mbps. Furthermore, our model for mobile bandwidth shows that 50% of the cellular connection-sharing devices will require <= 25 Mbps, 35% will require between 25-50 Mbps, and nearly 5% will require between 100-138 Mbps. Although this study shows results for a specific time period, our bandwidth models are time-independent and can be used for any period. Furthermore, our model can be employed in socio-economic models to predict the economic benefits and potential revenues.

AB Small object detection is one of the difficulties in the development of computer vision, especially in the case of complex image backgrounds, and the accuracy of small object detection still needs to be improved. In this article, we present a small object detection network based on YOLOv4, which solves some obstacles that hinder the performance of traditional methods in small object detection tasks in complex road environments, such as few effective features, the influence of image noise, and occlusion by large objects, and improves the detection of small objects in complex background situations such as drone aerial survey images. The improved network architecture reduces the computation and GPU memory consumption of the network by including the cross-stage partial network (CSPNet) structure into the spatial pyramid pool (SPP) structure in the YOLOv4 network and convolutional layers after concatenation operation. Secondly, the accuracy of the model on the small object detection task is improved by adding a more suitable small object detection head and removing one used for large object detection. Then, a new branch is added to extract feature information at a shallow location in the backbone part, and the feature information extracted from this branch is fused in the neck part to enrich the small object location information extracted by the model; when fusing feature information from different levels in the backbone, the fusion weight of useful information is increased by adding a weighting mechanism to improve detection performance at each scale. Finally, a coordinated attention (CA) module is embedded at a suitable location in the neck part, which enables the model to focus on spatial location relationships and inter-channel relationships and enhances feature representation capability. The proposed model has been tested to detect 10 different target objects in aerial images from drones and five different road traffic signal signs in images taken from vehicles in a complex road environment. The detection speed of the model meets the criteria of real-time detection, the model has better performance in terms of accuracy compared to the existing state-of-the-art detection models, and the model has only 44M parameters. On the drone aerial photography dataset, the average accuracy of YOLOv4 and YOLOv5L is 42.79% and 42.10%, respectively, while our model achieves an average accuracy (mAP) of 52.76%; on the urban road traffic light dataset, the proposed model achieves an average accuracy of 96.98%, which is also better than YOLOv4 (95.32%), YOLOv5L (94.79%) and other advanced models. The current work provides an efficient method for small object detection in complex road environments, which can be extended to scenarios involving small object detection, such as drone cruising and autonomous driving.

AB In an increasing number of scientific and commercial mission scenarios at sea, it is required to simultaneously localize a group of underwater targets. The latter may include moored systems, autonomous vehicles, and even human divers. For reasons that have to do with the unavailability of Global Positioning System underwater, cost reduction, and simplicity of operation, there is currently a surge of interest in the development of range-based multiple target localization systems that rely on the computation of the distances between the targets and a number of sensor nodes deployed at the ocean surface, equipped with acoustic range measuring devices. In the case of a single target, there is a wealth of literature on the problem of optimal acoustic sensor placement to maximize the information available for target localization using trilateration methods. In the case of multiple targets, however, the literature is scarce. Motivated by these considerations, we address the problem of optimal sensor placement for multiple underwater target positioning. In this setup, we are naturally led to a multiple objective optimization problem, the solution of which allows for the analysis of the trade-offs involved in the localization of the targets simultaneously. To this end, we resort to tools from estimation theory and multi-objective optimization. For each target, the function to be minimized (by proper choice of the sensor configuration) is related to the determinant of the corresponding Fisher information matrix, which yields information on the minimum possible covariance of the error with which the position of the target can be estimated using any non-biased estimator. To deal with the fact that more than one target is involved, we exploit the concept of multiple objective Pareto-optimal solutions to characterize the best possible accuracy with which each of the targets can be positioned, given constraints on the desired positioning accuracy of the other targets. Simulation examples illustrate how, for a three-sensor network and two targets, it is possible to define an optimal sensor configuration that yields large positioning accuracy for both targets simultaneously, using convex optimization tools. When more than two targets are involved, however, more than three sensors are required to exploit an adequate trade-off of the accuracy with which each target can be positioned by resorting to non-convex and Pareto-optimization tools. We show how in this case the optimal sensor configurations depend on the Pareto weights assigned to each of the targets, as well as on the number of sensors, the number of targets, and the uncertainty with which the positions of the targets are known a priori.

AB The oil and gas industry faces increasing pressure to remove people from dangerous offshore environments. Robots present a cost-effective and safe method for inspection, repair, and maintenance of topside and marine offshore infrastructure. In this work, we introduce a new multi-sensing platform, the Limpet, which is designed to be low-cost and highly manufacturable, and thus can be deployed in huge collectives for monitoring offshore platforms. The Limpet can be considered an instrument, where in abstract terms, an instrument is a device that transforms a physical variable of interest (measurand) into a form that is suitable for recording (measurement). The Limpet is designed to be part of the ORCA (Offshore Robotics for Certification of Assets) Hub System, which consists of the offshore assets and all the robots (Underwater Autonomous Vehicles, drones, mobile legged robots etc.) interacting with them. The Limpet comprises the sensing aspect of the ORCA Hub System. We integrated the Limpet with Robot Operating System (ROS), which allows it to interact with other robots in the ORCA Hub System. In this work, we demonstrate how the Limpet can be used to achieve real-time condition monitoring for offshore structures, by combining remote sensing with signal-processing techniques. We show an example of this approach for monitoring offshore wind turbines, by designing an experimental setup to mimic a wind turbine using a stepper motor and custom-designed acrylic fan blades. We use the distance sensor, which is a Time-of-Flight sensor, to achieve the monitoring process. We use two different approaches for the condition monitoring process: offline and online classification. We tested the offline classification approach using two different communication techniques: serial and Wi-Fi. We performed the online classification approach using two different communication techniques: LoRa and optical. We train our classifier offline and transfer its parameters to the Limpet for online classification. We simulated and classified four different faults in the operation of wind turbines. We tailored a data processing procedure for the gathered data and trained the Limpet to distinguish among each of the functioning states. The results show successful classification using the online approach, where the processing and analysis of the data is done on-board by the microcontroller. By using online classification, we reduce the information density of our transmissions, which allows us to substitute short-range high-bandwidth communication systems with low-bandwidth long-range communication systems. This work shines light on how robots can perform on-board signal processing and analysis to gain multi-functional sensing capabilities, improve their communication requirements, and monitor the structural health of equipment.

AB Cold-water coral ridges with waveform morphology are commonly observed in mound surfaces in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and interpreted as sediment waves overgrown by corals. This work documents the first cold-water coral ridges that are waveform but lack sand dune cores. These coral ridges are situated at the base of the Miami Terrace in the Straits of Florida (depths of 630 to 870 m). They are entirely biogenic in origin and are unrelated to antecedent topography. Five lines of evidence, based on 27 km(2) of high-resolution geophysical, oceanographic, and ground-truthing data, support this interpretation. First, the waveform coral ridges are aligned perpendicular to a southward flowing bottom current and juxtaposed to an active sand dune field devoid of corals. Both the coral ridges and sand dunes are asymmetric in profile with respect to the current. However, the ridges have their steep sides facing the current, whereas the dunes exhibit a steep leeside. Second, the coral ridge matrix consists of very fine sand to mud particles with no bedload sand transport on the ridge flanks or troughs. In contrast, active sand ripples superimpose the juxtaposed sand dunes indicating that coarse sand is transported via traction in this domain. Third, bedload sand transport occurs in linear streaks at the shallowest part of the surveyed area. These streaks orthogonally crosscut some coral ridges, but coral colonies are not aligned along these streaks. Instead, the bedload sand smothers the coral colonies and thereby segments the ridges. Fourth, the sand dune and coral ridge acoustic responses are different. Below the dunes, there is no sub-bottom reflection due to energy attenuation. In contrast, a continuous reflection below the coral ridges proves the absence of attenuating sand cores. Fifth, this continuous sub-bottom reflection is not correlated with the coral ridge topography, indicating that antecedent topography does not control the waveform morphology and spatial distribution of the ridges. The differences in depositional profiles, sediment dynamics and features, as well as acoustic facies between the coral ridges and the juxtaposed dunes show that the coral ridges are entirely bioconstnictional and not a veneer of corals covering paleo-sand dunes. This field of biogenic ridges at the Miami Terrace and the distribution of sand streaks as well as active sand dunes provide new insights how the lateral variability of current velocities and sediment transport conditions control the morphology, distribution and genesis of cold-water coral features.

AB The sixth-generation (6G) technology of mobile networks will establish new standards to fulfill unreachable performance requirements by fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks. This is due to the high requirements for more intelligent network, ultra-lower latency, extreme network com-munication speed, and supporting massive number of various connected applications. In the long term, the convergence of various business developments with communication platforms, as initiated by 5G, will exaggerate and highlight areas where 5G's capabilities will fall short of performance requirements. Motivated by the development of applications in massive connections, future net-works, developments, and technological advancements for mobile communications that go beyond fifth-generation (B5G) networks are being developed. In this context, highly immersive applications are demanded, such as three-dimensional (3D) communications, digital twins, or massive extended reality (XR)/virtual reality (VR) applications, which will need 6G capabilities to be realized at scale to be commercially feasible. Mainly, we anticipate that only the upcoming 6G networks will be cap-able of running extremely high-performance connectivity with massive numbers of connected devices, even under laborious scenarios such as extreme density, diverse mobility, and energetic environments. In this article, we look at the most recent trends and future emerging trends that are possible to operate 6G network. Paper aims to provide more inclusive and brief review about 6G mobile communication technology in one survey paper. Initially, a comprehensive overview of the 6G system is introduced in terms of visions, drivers, requirements, architecture, and usage scenarios required to enable 6G applications. After that, the opportunities and advantages of 6G mobile technology has been discussed. Further, the promising new techniques that enable 6G tech-nology has been highlighted. This is followed by a potential discussion of challenges and research directions. This article is envisioned to serve as an informative guideline to stimulate interest and further studies for subsequent research and development of 6G networks. Paper will enable the readers to briefly figure out the key requirements, targets, that will be need and the applications, advantages, and opportunities that can be offered as well as the challenges that need to be addressed before the implementation of this new technology.(c) 2022 THE AUTHORS.

TI Automated classification of fauna in seabed photographs: The impact of
   training and validation dataset size, with considerations for the class

AB Machine learning is rapidly developing as a tool for gathering data from imagery and may be useful in identifying (classifying) visible specimens in large numbers of seabed photographs. Application of an automated classification workflow requires manually identified specimens to be supplied for training and validating the model. These training and validation datasets are generally generated by partitioning the available manual identified specimens; typical ratios of training to validation dataset sizes are 75:25 or 80:20. However, this approach does not facilitate the desired scalability, which would require models to successfully classify specimens in hundreds of thousands to millions of images after training on a relatively small subset of manually identified specimens. A second problem is related to the 'class imbalance', where natural community structure means that fewer specimens of rare morphotypes are available for model training. We investigated the impact of independent variation of the training and validation dataset sizes on the performance of a convolutional neural network classifier on benthic invertebrates visible in a very large set of seabed photographs captured by an autonomous underwater vehicle at the Porcupine Abyssal Plain Sustained Observatory. We tested the impact of increasing training dataset size on specimen classification in a single validation dataset, and then tested the impact of increasing validation set size, evaluating ecological metrics in addition to computer vision metrics. Computer vision metrics (recall, precision, F1-score) indicated that classification improved with increasing training dataset size. In terms of ecological metrics, the number of morphotypes recorded increased, while diversity decreased with increasing training dataset size. Variation and bias in diversity metrics decreased with increasing training dataset size. Multivariate dispersion in apparent community composition was reduced, and bias from expert-derived data declined with increasing training dataset size. In contrast, classification success and resulting ecological metrics did not differ significantly with varying validation dataset sizes. Thus, the selection of an appropriate training dataset size is key to ensuring robust automated classifications of benthic invertebrates in seabed photographs, in terms of ecological results, and validation may be conducted on a comparatively small dataset with confidence that similar results will be obtained in a larger production dataset. In addition, our results suggest that automated classification of less common morphotypes may be feasible, providing that the overall training dataset size is sufficiently large. Thus, tactics for reducing class imbalance in the training dataset may produce improvements in the resulting ecological metrics.

TI Subglacial bathymetry and sediment distribution beneath Pine Island

AB Pine Island Glacier (PIG) in the Amundsen Sea sector of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is losing mass and contributing to global sea-level rise at an accelerating rate. Although recent observations and modeling have identified the incursion of relatively warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) beneath the PIG ice shelf (PIGIS) as the main driver of this ice-mass loss, the lack of precise bathymetry limits furthering our understanding of the ice-ocean interactions and improving the accuracy of modeling. Here we present updated bathymetry and sediment distribution beneath the PIGIS, modeled by the inversion of aerogravity data with constraints from active-source seismic data, observations from an autonomous underwater vehicle, and the regional gravity-anomaly field derived from satellite gravity observations. Modeled bathymetry shows a submarine ridge beneath the middle of PIGIS that rises similar to 350 to 400 m above the surrounding sea floor, with a minimum water-column thickness of similar to 200 m above it. This submarine ridge continues across the whole width of the 45-km wide ice shelf, with no deep troughs crossing it, confirming the general features of the previously predicted sub-ice-shelf ocean circulation. However, the relatively low resolution of the aerogravity data and limitations in our inversion method leave a possibility that there is an undetected, few-kilometers-wide or narrower trough that may alter the predicted sub-ice-shelf ocean circulation. Modeled sediment distribution indicates a sedimentary basin of up to similar to 800 m thick near the current grounding zone of the main PIG trunk and extending farther inland, and a region seaward of the submarine ridge where sediments are thin or absent with exposed crystalline basement that extends seaward into Pine Island Bay. Therefore, the submarine ridge marks the transition from a thick sedimentary basin providing a smooth interface over which ice could flow easily by sliding or sediment deformation, to a region with no to little sediments and instead a rough interface over which ice flows mainly by deformation. We hypothesize that the post-Last Glacial Maximum retreat of PIG stabilized at this location because of the spatial transition in basal conditions. This in turn supports the hypothesis that the recent retreat of PIG was strongly forced, probably by changes in ocean circulation, rather than occurring because of ongoing response to the end of the ice age or other changes inland of or beneath PIG.

AB In Industry 4.0 compatible workshops, the demand for Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) used in indoor logistics systems has increased remarkably. In these indoor logistics systems, it may be necessary to execute multiple transport tasks simultaneously using multiple AGVs. However, some challenges require special solutions for AGVs to be used in industrial autonomous transportation. These challenges can be addressed under four main headings: positioning, optimum path planning, collision avoidance and optimum task allocation. The solutions produced for these challenges may require special studies that vary depending on the type of tasks and the working environment in which AGVs are used. This study focuses on the problem of automated indoor logistics carried out in the simultaneous production of textile finishing enterprises. In the study, a centralized cloud system that enables multiple AGVs to work in collaboration has been developed. The finishing enterprise of a denim manufacturing factory was handled as a case study and modelling of mapping-planning processes was carried out using the developed cloud system. In the cloud system, RestFul APIs, for mapping the environment, and WebSocket methods, to track the locations of AGVs, have been developed. A collaboration module in harmony with the working model has been developed for AGVs to be used for fabric transportation. The collaboration module consists of task definition, battery management-optimization, selection of the most suitable batch trolleys (provides mobility of fabrics for the finishing mills), optimum task distribution and collision avoidance stages. In the collaboration module, all the finishing processes until the product arrives the delivery point are defined as tasks. A task allocation algorithm has been developed for the optimum performance of these tasks. The multi-fitness function that optimizes the total path of the AGVs, the elapsed time and the energy spent while performing the tasks have been determined. An assignment matrix based on K nearest neighbor (k-NN) and permutation possibilities was created for the optimal task allocation, and the most appropriate row was selected according to the optimal path totals of each row in the matrix. The D* Lite algorithm has been used to calculate the optimum path between AGVs and goals by avoiding static obstacles. By developing simulation software, the problem model was adapted and the operation of the cloud system was tested. Simulation results showed that the developed cloud system was successfully implemented. Although the developed cloud system has been applied as a case study in fabric finishing workshops with a complex structure, it can be used in different sectors as its logistic processes are similar.

   INFORMATION
AB Forward collision warning (FCW) and autonomous emergency braking (AEB) systems are increasingly available and prevent or mitigate collisions by alerting the driver or autonomously braking the vehicle. Threat-assessment and decision-making algorithms for FCW and AEB aim to find the best compromise for safety by intervening at the "right" time: neither too early, potentially upsetting the driver, nor too late, possibly missing opportunities to avoid the collision.
   Today, the extent to which activation times for FCW and AEB should depend on factors such as pedestrian speed and lane width is unknown. To guide the design of FCW and AEB intervention time, we employed a fractional factorial design, and determined how seven factors (crossing side, car speed, pedestrian speed, crossing angle, pedestrian size, zebra-crossing presence, and lane width) affect the driver's response process and comfort zone when negotiating an intersection with a pedestrian. Ninety-four volunteers drove through an intersection in a fixed-base driving simulator, which was based on open-source software (OpenDS). Several parameters, including pedestrian time-to-arrival and driver response time, were calculated to describe the driver response process and define driver comfort boundaries.
   Linear mixed-effect models showed that driver responses depended mainly on pedestrian time-to-arrival and visibility, whereas factors such as pedestrian size, zebra-crossing presence, and lane width did not significantly influence the driver response process. Drivers released the accelerator pedal in 99.8 % of the trials and braked in 89% of the trials. Forty-six percent of the drivers changed their negotiation strategy (proportion of pedal braking to engine braking) to minimize driving effort over the course of the experiment. In fact, 51 % of the of the inexperienced drivers changed their response strategy whereas only 40 % of the experienced drivers did; nevertheless, all drivers behaved similarly, independent of driving experience. The flexible and customizable driving environment provided by OpenDS may be a viable platform for behavioural experiments in driving simulators.
   Results from this study suggest that visibility and pedestrian time-to-arrival are the most important variables for defining the earliest acceptable FCW and AEB activations. Fractional factorial design effectively compared the influence of seven factors on driver behaviour within a single experiment; however, this design did not allow in-depth data analysis. In the future, OpenDS might become a standard platform, enabling crowdsourcing and favouring repeatability across studies in traffic safety. Finally, this study advises future design and evaluation procedures (e.g. new car assessment programs) for FCW and AEB by highlighting which factors deserve further investigation and which ones do not.

TI Crowd-Based Learning of Spatial Fields for the Internet of Things
   <i>From harvesting of data to inference</i>
SO IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
AB The knowledge of spatial distributions of physical quantities, such as radio-frequency (RF) interference, pollution, geomagnetic field magnitude, temperature, humidity, audio, and light intensity, will foster the development of new context-aware applications. For example, knowing the distribution of RF interference might significantly improve cognitive radio systems [1], [2]. Similarly, knowing the spatial variations of the geomagnetic field could support autonomous navigation of robots (including drones) in factories and/or hazardous scenarios [3]. Other examples are related to the estimation of temperature gradients, detection of sources of RF signals, or percentages of certain chemical components. As a result, people could get personalized health-related information based on their exposure to sources of risks (e.g., chemical or pollution). We refer to these spatial distributions of physical quantities as spatial fields. All of the aforementioned examples have in common that learning the spatial fields requires a large number of sensors (agents) surveying the area [4], [5].
   A common way to sense environmental variables is the deployment of dedicated wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which continues to stimulate fertile research activities in the scientific community. Typical WSN applications are oriented to sense specific physical quantities (e.g., temperature) in well-defined areas [6], [7]. Unfortunately WSNs are generally characterized by significant constraints in terms of deployment cost, energy limitation, and the need for maintenance. These constraints prevent them from becoming scalable and therefore from being the ultimate solution for automated and distributed sensing of the physical world.
   The expected pervasive diffusion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices (fixed and mobile) opens up a unique opportunity for a wide and massive sensing and mapping (i.e., georeferencing of physical quantities). In fact, the IoT constitutes a paradigm where a multitude of heterogeneous devices is able to sense the environment, process data, and actuate, thus creating the necessary infrastructure for cyberphysical systems. This infrastructure galvanizes technologies such as smart grids, smart homes, smart cities, and intelligent transportation [8], [9].
   From the extensive variety of applications of the IoT, we are interested in those that will benefit from having a spatial coverage of a wide area due to a large number of agents navigating through it. For instance, this can be the case when devices are carried by people or autonomous agents (e.g., vehicles, robots, or drones) moving in outdoor-and indoor-populated environments like malls, stadiums, or crowded buildings. One can even imagine cities at large, if one considers much larger settings in size. Thanks to the widespread diffusion of IoT devices with heterogeneous sensors, the estimation of spatial physical fields is creating a new trend for next-generation sensor networks, referred to as mobile crowdsensing networks [10]-[13]. This is basically a zero-effort approach to automatically collect and process data. Recently, as an example, this concept has been proposed for zero-effort automatic mapping of environmental features using sensors already embedded in smartphones, such as magnetometers and Wi-Fi [14]-[17]. In such settings, the contribution of the agent to the sensing process is as simple as carrying the personal device in a pocket while the individual is moving around. Individuals are not even requested to be participatory, as the sensing process could run in the background during the normal operation of the device. In other words, agents are aware of the background sensing process, but they are not participatory in the sense that they are not requested to follow particular paths to make the learning process more effective. Thus, the sensing process is not an exclusive task, and it arises from the dynamic reality of humans or autonomous agents. The sensing process is a result of piggybacking on the capabilities of today's and future wireless personal devices. Including data generated by these devices will dramatically increase the amount of data for sensing and mapping purposes, with obvious benefits in terms of the resulting accuracy.
   In this context, the IoT is the technological enabler for crowdsensing and learning of spatial fields. Interestingly, IoT devices are, in general, able to communicate among themselves, either directly or through a fusion node that can potentially be in the cloud. Thanks to communication capabilities, empirical data gathered by mobile agents (the crowd) can be collected and processed by learning algorithms located in the cloud. These algorithms exploit the correspondence between the position and the value of the physical quantity measured in that position to estimate the spatial field. As a consequence, positioning and spatial field estimation are intimately intertwined, as will be illustrated in the "Sensing and Positioning" section.
   Crowdsourcing-based learning methods rely on the experience gained by previous agents. In principle, it is possible that, with crowd-based learning, one can perform optimal information fusion [10]. On the other hand, moving from the well-controlled conditions of WSN scenarios, where nodes are deployed in ad hoc known locations, to crowdsensing settings, where agents move around in an uncontrolled manner, entails a number of issues that need to be addressed. The methods rely on sharing through cloud mechanisms [18], but they can be of practical relevance in IoT applications only if their computational and memory requirements do not grow with the amount of collected data. Therefore, novel methodologies for multisensor data fusion and information processing are needed. They should guarantee efficient statistical representation of spatial fields and a computational complexity that does not depend on the number of measurements. Further, the algorithms need to be robust against irregular positioning and measurement errors.

ID ORDER PICKING
AB Purpose
   The Industry 4.0 initiative - with its ultimate objective of revolutionizing the supply-chain - putted more emphasis on smart and autonomous systems, creating new opportunities to add flexibility and agility to automatic manufacturing systems. These systems are designed to free people from monotonous and repetitive tasks, enabling them to concentrate in knowledge-based jobs. One of these repetitive functions is the order-picking task which consists of collecting parts from storage (warehouse) and distributing them among the ordering stations. An order-picking system can also pick finished parts from working stations to take them to the warehouse. The purpose of this paper is to present a simplified model of a robotic order-picking system, i.e. a mobile manipulator composed by an automated guided vehicle (AGV), a collaborative robot (cobot) and a robotic hand.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Details about its implementation are also presented. The AGV is needed to safely navigate inside the factory infrastructure, namely, between the warehouse and the working stations located in the shop-floor or elsewhere. For that purpose, an ActiveONE AGV, from Active Space Automation, was selected. The collaborative robot manipulator is used to move parts from/into the mobile platform (feeding the working stations and removing parts for the warehouse). A cobot from Kassow Robots was selected (model KR 810), kindly supplied by partner companies Roboplan (Portugal) and Kassow Robotics (Denmark). An Arduino MKR1000 board was also used to interconnect the user interface, the AGV and the collaborative robot. The graphical user interface was developed in C# using the Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 IDE, taking advantage of this experience in this type of language and programming environment.
   Findings
   The resulting prototype was fully demonstrated in the partner company warehouse (Active Space Automation) and constitutes a possible order-picking solution, which is ready to be integrated into advanced solutions for the factories of the future.
   Originality/value
   A solution to fully automate the order-picking task at an industrial shop-floor was presented and fully demonstrated. The objective was to design a system that could be easy to use, to adapt to different applications and that could be a basic infrastructure for advanced order-picking systems. The system proved to work very well, executing all the features required for an order-picking system working in an Industry 4.0 scenario where humans and machines must act as co-workers. Although all the system design objectives were accomplished, there are still opportunities to improve and add features to the presented solution. In terms of improvements, a different robotic hand will be used in the final setup, depending on the type of objects that are being required to move. The amount of equipment that is located on-board of the AGV can be significantly reduced, freeing space and lowering the weight that the AGV carries. For example, the controlling computer can be substituted by a single-board-computer without any advantage. Also, the cobot should be equipped with a wrist camera to identify objects and landmark. This would allow the cobot to fully identify the position and orientation of the objects to pick and drop. The wrist camera should also use bin-picking software to fully identify the shape of the objects to pick and also their relative position (if they are randomly located in a box, for example).
   These features are easy to add to the developed mobile manipulator, as there are a few vision systems in the market (some that integrate with the selected cobot) that can be easily integrated in the solution. Finally, this paper reports a development effort that neglected, for practical reasons, all issues related with certification, safety, training, etc. A future follow-up paper, reporting a practical use-case implementation, will properly address those practical and operational issues.

AB In this study, three-dimensional (3D) spatial data, two-dimensional (2D) texture information, and automatic marking processes were used for the detection and classification of car parts. The automatic marking processes involved automatic car part segmentation and classification, car part detection and classification on the basis of images of 2D textures, and car part segmentation and car identification on the basis of a 3D point cloud. The 2D image processing system identifies car parts and generates numerous car texture images, which are subjected to three stages of processing. In the first stage of processing, automated segmentation technology is used to segment images; in the second stage, different types of training images with various backgrounds are generated; and in the third stage, the You Only Look Once v3 model is used to identify car parts on the basis of the generated training images. The adopted 3D model conducts processing over two stages. In the first stage, a 3D triangular grid is combined with a texture image to achieve car part identification at a grid point by employing a PointNet model trained using ground truth data. In the second stage, the trained PointNet model is used for detecting the parts of a 3D car model on the basis of 3D triangular mesh data. The precision of fine part segmentation from texture images was considerably higher than that of simple part segmentation. In car part detection and classification experiments on texture images, the mean intersection over union (mIoU) and mean average percentage both exceeded 70%. In a 3D car model experiment conducted using the ShapeNet dataset, the average mIoU and accuracy were 73.66% and 90.2%, respectively. When the developed PointNet model was trained using the Train-2000 dataset, the mIoU and accuracy of the model were 40.6% and 56.64%, respectively. When the developed PointNet model was trained using the Train dataset, the mIoU and accuracy of the model were 40.73% and 61.61%, respectively. The developed model achieved a 4.97% higher accuracy when training it with the Train dataset than when training it with the Train-2000 dataset. However, the mIoU of this model was only 0.13% higher when it was trained with the Train dataset than when it was trained with the Train-2000 dataset. When 3DNetWeight-2 was used as the initial parameter of the developed model in the final training, the mIoU and accuracy of the model were 44.27% and 61.98%, respectively-3.54% and 0.97% higher than those obtained without transfer learning, respectively. In sum, the proposed method can identify different parts of objects, and the findings serve as a reference for the design of simulation systems for autonomous vehicles. There are also applied to automated automobile management, medical technology, military training, aerospace technology, and disaster response systems.

AB Society's needs for a network of in situ ocean observing systems cross many areas of earth and marine science. Here we review the science themes that benefit from data supplied from ocean observatories. Understanding from existing studies is fragmented to the extent that it lacks the coherent long-term monitoring needed to address questions at the scales essential to understand climate change and improve geo-hazard early warning. Data sets from the deep sea are particularly rare with long-term data available from only a few locations worldwide. These science areas have impacts on societal health and well-being and our awareness of ocean function in a shifting climate.
   Substantial efforts are underway to realise a network of open-ocean observatories around European Seas that will operate over multiple decades. Some systems are already collecting high-resolution data from surface, water column, seafloor, and sub-seafloor sensors linked to shore by satellite or cable connection in real or near-real time, along with samples and other data collected in a delayed mode. We expect that such observatories will contribute to answering major ocean science questions including: How can monitoring of factors such as seismic activity, pore fluid chemistry and pressure, and gas hydrate stability improve seismic, slope failure, and tsunami warning? What aspects of physical oceanography, biogeochemical cycling, and ecosystems will be most sensitive to climatic and anthropogenic change? What are natural versus anthropogenic changes? Most fundamentally, how are marine processes that occur at differing scales related?
   The development of ocean observatories provides a substantial opportunity for ocean science to evolve in Europe. Here we also describe some basic attributes of network design. Observatory networks provide the means to coordinate and integrate the collection of standardised data capable of bridging measurement scales across a dispersed area in European Seas adding needed certainty to estimates of future oceanic conditions. Observatory data can be analysed along with other data such as those from satellites, drifting floats, autonomous underwater vehicles, model analysis, and the known distribution and abundances of marine fauna in order to address some of the questions posed above. Standardised methods for information management are also becoming established to ensure better accessibility and traceability of these data sets and ultimately to increase their use for societal benefit. The connection of ocean observatory effort into larger frameworks including the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and the Global Monitoring of Environment and Security (GMES) is integral to its success. It is in a greater integrated framework that the full potential of the component systems will be realised. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: It is believed that artificial intelligence (AI) will be an integral part of health care services in the near future and will be incorporated into several aspects of clinical care such as prognosis, diagnostics, and care planning. Thus, many technology companies have invested in producing AI clinical applications. Patients are one of the most important beneficiaries who potentially interact with these technologies and applications; thus, patients' perceptions may affect the widespread use of clinical AI. Patients should be ensured that AI clinical applications will not harm them, and that they will instead benefit from using AI technology for health care purposes. Although human-AI interaction can enhance health care outcomes, possible dimensions of concerns and risks should be addressed before its integration with routine clinical care.
   Objective: The main objective of this study was to examine how potential users (patients) perceive the benefits, risks, and use of AI clinical applications for their health care purposes and how their perceptions may be different if faced with three health care service encounter scenarios.
   Methods: We designed a 2x3 experiment that crossed a type of health condition (ie, acute or chronic) with three different types of clinical encounters between patients and physicians (ie, AI clinical applications as substituting technology, AI clinical applications as augmenting technology, and no AI as a traditional in-person visit). We used an online survey to collect data from 634 individuals in the United States.
   Results: The interactions between the types of health care service encounters and health conditions significantly influenced individuals' perceptions of privacy concerns, trust issues, communication barriers, concerns about transparency in regulatory standards, liability risks, benefits, and intention to use across the six scenarios. We found no significant differences among scenarios regarding perceptions of performance risk and social biases.
   Conclusions: The results imply that incompatibility with instrumental, technical, ethical, or regulatory values can be a reason for rejecting AI applications in health care. Thus, there are still various risks associated with implementing AI applications in diagnostics and treatment recommendations for patients with both acute and chronic illnesses. The concerns are also evident if the AI applications are used as a recommendation system under physician experience, wisdom, and control. Prior to the widespread rollout of AI, more studies are needed to identify the challenges that may raise concerns for implementing and using AI applications. This study could provide researchers and managers with critical insights into the determinants of individuals' intention to use AI clinical applications. Regulatory agencies should establish normative standards and evaluation guidelines for implementing AI in health care in cooperation with health care institutions. Regular audits and ongoing monitoring and reporting systems can be used to continuously evaluate the safety, quality, transparency, and ethical factors of AI clinical applications.

AB Over the past 520 million years, the process of evolution has produced a diversity of nearly 25 000 species of fish. This diversity includes thousands of different fin designs which are largely the product of natural selection for locomotor performance. Fish fins can be grouped into two major categories: median and paired fins. Fins are typically supported at their base by a series of segmentally arranged bony or cartilaginous elements, and fish have extensive muscular control over fin conformation.
   Recent experimental hydrodynamic investigation of fish fin function in a diversity of freely swimming fish (including sharks, sturgeon, trout, sunfish, and surfperch) has demonstrated the role of fins in propulsion and maneuvering. Fish pectoral fins generate either separate or linked vortex rings during propulsion, and the lateral forces generated by pectoral fins are of similar magnitudes to thrust force during slow swimming. Yawing maneuvers involve differentiation of hydrodynamic function between left and right fins via vortex ring reorientation. Low-aspect ratio pectoral fins in sharks function to alter body pitch and induce vertical maneuvers through conformational changes of the fin trailing edge.
   The dorsal fin of fish displays a diversity of hydrodynamic function, from a discrete thrust-generating propulsor acting independently from the body, to a stabilizer generating only side forces. Dorsal fins play an active role in generating off-axis forces during maneuvering. Locomotor efficiency may be enhanced when the caudal fin intercepts the dorsal fin wake. The caudal fin of fish moves in a complex three-dimensional manner and evidence for thrust vectoring of caudal fin forces is presented for sturgeon which appear to have active control of the angle of vortices shed from the tail. Fish are designed to be unstable and are constantly using their control surfaces to generate opposing and balancing forces in addition to thrust.
   Lessons from fish for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) design include 1) location of multiple control surfaces distributed widely about the center of mass, 2) design of control surfaces that have a high degree of three-dimensional motion through a flexible articulation with the body, 3) the ability to modulate fin surface conformation, and 4) the simultaneous use of numerous control surfaces including locating some fin elements in the downstream wake generated by other fins.
   The ability to manufacture an AUV that takes advantage of these design features is currently limited by the nature of available materials and mechanical drive trains. But future developments in polymer artificial muscle technology will provide a new approach to propulsor design that will permit construction of biomimetic propulsors with conformational and articulational flexibility similar to that of fish fins.

TI Meltwater Lenses Over the Chukchi and the Beaufort Seas During Summer
   2019: From In Situ to Synoptic View
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
LA English
DT Article
DE sea surface salinity; SMOS; SMAP; Arctic ocean; meltwater lenses
ID SURFACE SALINITY; SMOS; VARIABILITY
AB We investigate the Chukchi and the Beaufort seas in the Arctic Ocean, where salty and warm Pacific Water flows in through the Bering Strait and interacts with the sea ice, contributing to its summer melt. Thanks to in situ measurements recorded by two saildrones deployed during summer 2019 and to refined sea ice filtering in satellite L-band radiometric data, we demonstrate the ability of satellite sea surface salinity (SSS) observed by Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity and Soil Moisture Active and Passive to capture SSS freshening induced by sea ice melt. We refer to these freshening events as meltwater lenses (MWL). The largest MWL observed by the saildrones during this period occupied a large part of the Chukchi shelf, with a SSS freshening reaching -5 practical salinity scale, persisting for up to 1 month. This MWL restricted the transfer of air-sea momentum to the upper ocean, as illustrated by measured wind speed and vertical profiles of currents. With satellite-based sea surface temperature, satellite SSS provides a monitoring of the different water masses encountered in the region during summer 2019. Using sea ice concentration and estimated Ekman transport, we analyze the spatial variability of sea surface properties after the sea ice edge retreat over the Chukchi and the Beaufort seas. The two MWL captured by the saildrones and the satellite measurements resulted from different dynamics. Over the Beaufort Sea, the MWL evolution followed the meridional sea ice retreat whereas, in the Chukchi Sea, a large persisting MWL was generated by advection and subsequent melting of a sea ice filament.
   Plain Language Summary The Arctic Ocean is an area of large variations in salinity. Salinity is a main driver of ocean circulation as it determines (with seawater temperature) the seawater density. However, very little is known about salinity variations there, due to the paucity of measurements near ice and in river plumes where surface water is freshest. Here, we use surface salinity measurements from two autonomous vehicles, named saildrones, to show that satellite measurements can identify the evolution of freshwater lenses that result from sea ice melt. Over the Chukchi and the Beaufort seas, sea surface salinity exhibits large seasonal changes, partly because of the sea ice melting. In this region, water from the North Pacific Ocean enters the Arctic Ocean, resulting in large gradients of salinity and temperature. During summer 2019, the saildrones measured the surface salinity and temperature variability as the sea ice retreated northwards. By comparing these data with the measurements from satellites, we showed that satellites can detect these pools of fresh surface water in the Arctic Ocean, increasing the field of application of satellites to understand changes in conditions that determine the Arctic's role in climate change.

   Disparities
SO JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH POLICY AND ECONOMICS

AB Background: Latino child populations are large and growing, and they present considerable unmet need for mental health treatment. Poverty, lack of health insurance, limited English proficiency, stigma, undocumented status, and inhospitable programming are among many factors that contribute to Latino-White mental health treatment disparities. Lower treatment expenditures serve as an important marker of Latino children's low rates of mental health treatment and limited participation once enrolled in services.
   Aims: We investigated whether total Latino-White expenditure disparities declined when autonomous, county-level mental health plans receive funds free of customary cost-sharing charges, especially when they capitalized on cultural and language-sensitive mental health treatment programs as vehicles to receive and spend treatment funds. Using Whites as benchmark, we considered expenditure pattern disparities favoring Whites over Latinos and, in a smaller number of counties, Latinos over Whites.
   Methods: Using segmented regression for interrupted time series on county level treatment systems observed over 64 quarters, we analyzed Medi-Cal paid claims for per-user total expenditures for mental health services delivered to children and youth (under 18 years of age) during a study period covering July 1, 1991 through June 30, 2007. Settlement-mandated Medicaid's Early Periodic Screening, Diafnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) expenditure increases began in the third quarter of 1995. Terms were introduced to assess immediate and long term inequality reduction as well as the role of culture and language-sensitive community-based programs.
   Results: Settlement-mandated increased EPSDT treatment funding was associated with more spending on Whites relative to Latinos unless plans arranged for cultural and language-sensitive mental health treatment programs. However, having programs served more to prevent expenditure disparities from growing than to reduce disparities.
   Discussion: EPSDT expanded funding increased proportional expenditures for Whites absent cultural and language-sensitive treatment programs. The programs moderate, but do not overcome, entrenched expenditure disparities. These findings use investment in mental health services for Latino populations to indicate treatment access and utilization, but do not explicitly reflect penetration rates or intensity of services for consumers.
   Implications for Policy: New funding, along with an expectation that Latino children's well documented mental health treatment disparities will be addressed, holds potential for improved mental health access and reducing utilization inequities for this population, especially when specialized, culturally and linguistically sensitive mental health treatment programs are present to serve as recipients of funding.
   Implications for Research: To further expand knowledge of how federal or state funding for community based mental health services for low income populations can drive down the longstanding and considerable Latino-White mental health treatment disparities, we must develop and test questions targeting policy drivers which can channel funding to programs and organizations aimed at delivering linguistically and culturally sensitive services to Latino children and their families.

AB Over the past decade, the artificial neural networks domain has seen a considerable embracement of deep neural networks among many applications. However, deep neural networks are typically computationally complex and consume high power, hindering their applicability for resource-constrained applications, such as self-driving vehicles, drones, and robotics. Spiking neural networks, often employed to bridge the gap between machine learning and neuroscience fields, are considered a promising solution for resource-constrained applications. Since deploying spiking neural networks on traditional von-Newman architectures requires significant processing time and high power, typically, neuromorphic hardware is created to execute spiking neural networks. The objective of neuromorphic devices is to mimic the distinctive functionalities of the human brain in terms of energy efficiency, computational power, and robust learning. Furthermore, natural language processing, a machine learning technique, has been widely utilized to aid machines in comprehending human language. However, natural language processing techniques cannot also be deployed efficiently on traditional computing platforms. In this research work, we strive to enhance the natural language processing traits/abilities by harnessing and integrating the SNNs traits, as well as deploying the integrated solution on neuromorphic hardware, efficiently and effectively. To facilitate this endeavor, we propose a novel, unique, and efficient sentiment analysis model created using a large-scale SNN model on SpiNNaker neuromorphic hardware that responds to user inputs. SpiNNaker neuromorphic hardware typically can simulate large spiking neural networks in real time and consumes low power. We initially create an artificial neural networks model, and then train the model using an Internet Movie Database (IMDB) dataset. Next, the pre-trained artificial neural networks model is converted into our proposed spiking neural networks model, called a spiking sentiment analysis (SSA) model. Our SSA model using SpiNNaker, called SSA-SpiNNaker, is created in such a way to respond to user inputs with a positive or negative response. Our proposed SSA-SpiNNaker model achieves 100% accuracy and only consumes 3970 Joules of energy, while processing around 10,000 words and predicting a positive/negative review. Our experimental results and analysis demonstrate that by leveraging the parallel and distributed capabilities of SpiNNaker, our proposed SSA-SpiNNaker model achieves better performance compared to artificial neural networks models. Our investigation into existing works revealed that no similar models exist in the published literature, demonstrating the uniqueness of our proposed model. Our proposed work would offer a synergy between SNNs and NLP within the neuromorphic computing domain, in order to address many challenges in this domain, including computational complexity and power consumption. Our proposed model would not only enhance the capabilities of sentiment analysis but also contribute to the advancement of brain-inspired computing. Our proposed model could be utilized in other resource-constrained and low-power applications, such as robotics, autonomous, and smart systems.

AB Soil moisture content (SMC) is a key factor in biogeochemical and atmospheric coupling processes. It plays an important role in areas such as agriculture, ecology and environment in arid region. Compared to the spaceborne remote sensing system, UAV platform with hyperspectral sensors possess higher spatial resolution and maneuverability. With UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) being increasingly popular, it offers brand new platform of remote sensing. This platform realizes the goal that quickly and quantificationally monitor object in the area. Moreover, hyperspectral sensors contribute to remote sensing when they enrich high dimensional and nanoscale data source. However, there still lacks a standardized research scheme for estimation of UAV by hyperspectral Remote Sensing. In this study, we obtained UAV hyperspectral image from a typically dry-farming region lying in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Hyperspectral image was pretreated using six methods of pretreatment, including first-derivative (FDR) , second-derivative (SDR) , continuum removal (CR), absorbance (A) , first-derivative absorbance (FDA) and second-derivative absorbance (SDA). From pretreatment foundation, four types spectral indices were proposed containing the Difference Index (DI) , the Ratio Index (RI), the Normalization Index (NDI) and the Perpendicular Index (PI). And the rationality of the spectral index was discussed from the spectral mechanism. Considering the superiority of ensemble learning algorithm rising in recent years, the SMC estimation model was constructed via Gradient Boosted Regression Tree (GBRT) Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). In these models, 28 appropriate spectral indices were used as independent variables and 70 SMC measured values as response variables. Spectral indices were ranked via importance based on ensemble learning model analyzed and compared to make a more comprehensive evaluation. The result indicated that : (1) atmospheric disturbance and soil background were eliminated effectively throughvarious pretreatment schemes and spectral indices. Pretreatment scheme A highlighted more spectral information and PI correlation was significant. (2) Optimum spectral index was A_PI (vertical bar r vertical bar =0. 773) that the ranking of importance ranks first, and the correlation coefficient vertical bar r vertical bar is the highest, and it had excellent performance in both linear and nonlinear relationships. (2) XGBoost prediction model was outstanding in three ensemble learning models, and it yielded the highest R-val(2), the lowest RMSP and the best RPD (R-val(2 ) =0. 926 , RMSEP=1. 943 and RPD =2. 556). The ranking of the predictive performance was XGBoost>RF>GBRT. This proved that this scheme was effective in digital mapping in arid region. In conclusion, there is potential high accuracy for UAV imagery based on hyperspectral imagery. This study afforded an effective method for predicting SMC in arid regions, and it provided a new perspective for quickly and easily monitoring object attributes and it proposed an alternative solution for predicting soil moisture. Ultimately, our program is supporting better management and conservation strategies for precision agriculture and ecosystems in arid regions.

TI URBANISM UNDER GOOGLE: LESSONS FROM SIDEWALK TORONTO
SO FORDHAM LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Cities around the world are rapidly adopting digital technologies, data analytics, and the trappings of "smart" infrastructure. These innovations are touted as solutions to help rationalize services and address rising urban challenges, whether in housing, transit, energy, law enforcement, health care, waste management, or population flow. Promises of urban innovation unite cities' need for help with technology firms' need for markets and are rarely subject to evidentiary burdens about projected benefits (let alone costs). For the city, being smart is about functioning better and attracting tech plaudits. For the technology company, the smart city is a way to capture the value of data flows-either by directly monetizing behavioral insights or by using those insights to design or acquire services-and then realizing the network effects and monopoly rents that have characterized information technology platforms.
   No company is more ambitious about exploring data flows and seeking to create and dominate networks of information than Google. In October 2017, Google affiliate Sidewalk Labs embarked on its first prototype smart city in Toronto, Canada, through a collaboration with the public development authority Waterfront Toronto. Together, the project partners are planning a new kind of data-driven urban environment: "the world's first neighborhood built from the Internet up. " 1 The vision is for a neighborhood featuring state-of-the-art sustainable architecture, autonomous vehicles, sensor-based surveillance, and data-driven "responsive" services. Much of the vision draws from leading city planning ideas and foregrounds progressive ideals of inclusivity and sustainability. However, for the crucial first eighteen months of the venture, many of the most consequential features of the Sidewalk Toronto project were hidden from view and unavailable for serious scrutiny. On basic questions about the proposed set of innovations, the players defied public accountability: questions about data collection, data control, privacy, competition, and procurement. Even more basic questions about the use of public space went unanswered: privatized services, land ownership, infrastructure ownership, and, in all cases, the question of who is in control. The net result is that there can be no confidence that the Sidewalk Toronto vision is compatible with democratic processes, sustained public governance, or the public interest. This Article analyzes the Sidewalk Toronto project as it took shape in its first phase, prior to the release of the Master Innovation and Development Plan, and explores three major governance challenges posed by the imagined "city of the future": privatization, platformization, and domination. The significance of this case study applies well beyond Toronto. Google and related companies are modeling future business growth embedded in cities and using projects like Sidewalk Toronto as test beds. What happens in Toronto is designed to be replicated. We conclude with some lessons highlighting the precarity of civic stewardship and public accountability when cities are confronted with tantalizing visions of privatized urban innovation.

AB During the 2005 Layered Organization in the Coastal Ocean (LOCO) field program in Monterey Bay, California, we integrated intensive water column surveys by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with satellite and mooring data to examine the spatiotemporal scales and processes of phytoplankton thin-layer development. Surveying inner to outer shelf waters repeatedly between August 18 and September 6, the AUV acquired 6841 profiles. By the criteria: [(1) thickness <= 3 rn at the full-width half-maximum, (2) peak chlorophyll at least twice the local background concentrations, and (3) a corresponding peak in optical backscattering], thin layers were detected in 3978 (58%) of the profiles. Average layer thickness was 1.4 m, and average intensity was 13.5 mu g l(-1) above (3.2x) background. Thin layers were observed at depths between 2.6 and 17.6 m, and their depths showed diurnal vertical migration of the layer phytoplankton populations. Horizontal scales of thin-layer patches ranged from < 100 m to > 10,000 m. A thin-layer index (TLI), computed from layer frequency, intensity and thinness, was highest in mid-shelf waters, coincident with a frontal zone between bay waters and an intrusion of low-salinity offshore waters. Satellite observations showed locally enhanced chlorophyll concentrations along the front, and in situ observations indicated that phytoplankton may have been affected by locally enhanced nutrient supply in the front and concentration of motile populations in a convergence zone. Minimum TLI was furthest offshore, in the area most affected by the intrusion of offshore, low-chlorophyll waters. Average thin-layer intensity doubled during August 25-29, in parallel with warming at the surface and cooling within and below the thermocline. During this apparent bloom of thin-layer populations, density oscillations in the diurnal frequency band increased by an order of magnitude at the shelfbreak and in near-bottom waters of the inner shelf, indicating the role of internal tidal pumping from Monterey Canyon onto the shelf. This nutrient transport process was mapped by the AUV. Peak TLI was observed on August 29 during a nighttime survey, when phytoplankton were concentrated in the nutricline. Empirical orthogonal function decomposition of the thin-layer particle size distribution data from this survey showed that throughout the inner to outer shelf survey domain. the layers were dominated by phytoplankton having a cross-section of similar to 50 mu m. This is consistent with the size of abundant Akashiwo sanguinea cells observed microscopically in water samples. During a subsequent and stronger intrusion of low-salinity offshore waters, spatially-averaged vertical density stratification decreased by > 50%, and phytoplankton thin layers disappeared almost completely from the AUV survey domain.

AB Future cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as smart cities, collaborative robots, autonomous vehicles or intelligent transport systems, are expected to be highly intelligent, electrified, and connected. This study explores a focal question about how these new characteristics may affect the education and research related to CPS in 2030, the date identified by the United Nations to achieve the Agenda for Sustainable Development. To this end, first, we have conducted a trend spotting activity, seeking to identify possible influencing factors that may have a great impact on the future of CPS education and research.
   These factors were clustered in a total of 12 trends - four certainties; namely connectivity, electrification, data and automation - and eight uncertainties; namely intelligence, data ethics, labour market, lifelong learning, higher education, trust in technology, technological development speed, and sustainable development goals.
   After that, two of the eight uncertainties are identified and used to construct a scenario matrix, which includes four scenarios. These two uncertainties - the so-called strategic uncertainties - are: fulfilment of sustainable development goals and the nature of the technological development, respectively. These two important uncertainties are considered to build the scenarios due to their potential impact on the research and education of CPS. For instance, sustainable development goals are significant targets for many initiatives, organisations and countries. While 2030 is the deadline to achieve these goals, the relationship between the sustainable development goals related to CPS research and education is not studied well. Similarly, the speed of technological development is seen as a driving force behind future CPS. However, the effect of this speed to CPS research and education environment is not known.
   Different outcomes of the chosen two uncertainties are, then, combined with the remaining trends and uncertainties. Consequently, four scenarios are derived. The Terminator scenario illustrates a dystopian future where profit is the driving force behind technological progress and sustainable development goals are not accomplished. In contrast, The Iron Giant scenario represents the successful implementation of the sustainable development goals where technological development is the force behind the accomplishment of these goals. The scenario called Slow Progress represents a future where gradual technological improvements are present, but sustainability is still not seen as concerning the issue. The Humanist scenario illustrates a future where slow technological development is happening yet sustainable development goals are successfully implemented.
   Finally, the scenarios are used to initiate discussions by illustrating what the future of research and education could look like and a list of strategies for future CPS research and education environments is proposed. To this end, we invite educators, researchers, institutions and governments to develop the necessary strategies to enable data-orientated, continuous, interdisciplinary, collaborative, ethical, and sustainable research and education by improving digital fluency, advancing digital equality, contributing to new ways of teaching complex thinking, expanding access to learning platforms and preparing next generations to adapt for a rapidly changing future of work conditions.

AB Repeat glider sections obtained during 2014-2016, as part of the Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program, are used to quantify the circulation and transport of North Atlantic Current (NAC) branches over the Rockall Plateau. Using 16 glider sections collected along 58 degrees N and between 21 degrees W and 15 degrees W, absolute geostrophic velocities are calculated, and subsequently the horizontal and vertical structure of the transport are characterized. The annual mean northward transport (standard deviation) is 5.13.2Sv over the Rockall Plateau. During summer (May to October), the mean northward transport is stronger and reaches 6.72.6Sv. This accounts for 43% of the total NAC transport of upper-ocean waters (sigma(O)<27.55kg/m(3)) estimated by Sarafanov et al. (2012, ) along 59.5 degrees N, between the Reykjanes Ridge and Scotland. Two quasi-permanent northward flowing branches of the NAC are identified: (i) the Hatton Bank Jet (6.3 2.1Sv) over the eastern flank of the Iceland Basin (20.5 degrees W to 18.5 degrees W) and (ii) the Rockall Bank Jet (1.5 0.7Sv) over the eastern flank of the Hatton-Rockall Basin (16 degrees W to 15 degrees W). Transport associated with the Rockall Bank Jet is mostly depth independent during summer, while 30% of the Hatton Bank Jet transport is due to vertical geostrophic shear. Uncertainties are estimated for each individual glider section using a Monte Carlo approach, and mean uncertainties of the absolute transport are less than 0.5Sv. Although comparisons with altimetry-based estimates indicate similar large-scale circulation patterns, altimetry data do not resolve small mesoscale current bands in the Hatton-Rockall Basin which are strongly needed for the right transport estimates.
   Plain Language Summary There is mounting evidence that heat and freshwater transported by the North Atlantic Current (eastward extension of the Gulf Stream) heavily influences European and global climate. To adequately measure this current and understand its dynamics, underwater gliders navigate over the Rockall Plateau, a remote region of the North Atlantic located more than 400km off Scotland. These robots collect data up to a kilometer beneath the ocean's surface and, due to their low energy consumption, can operate over thousands of kilometers for months at a time. This study analyzes 2years of continuous ocean glider measurements in the North Atlantic and reveals two branches of the North Atlantic Current over the Rockall Plateau that we named the Hatton Bank Jet and the Rockall Bank Jet. For the first time, the monthly variability of these currents was characterized (speed and horizontal/vertical extension). These branches carry a significant portion of the upper-ocean waters transported by the North Atlantic Current (40%). This work highlights the importance of using autonomous underwater vehicles as part of an ocean observatory. In addition to monitoring the state of the North Atlantic Ocean, these underwater robots help us understand its dynamics, which impacts the European and global climate.

   control; information security; intelligent control; power grid; power
   systems control; Smart grid
AB As electrical grids evolve through the introduction of additional "smart" sensors, actuators, and control systems, cybersecurity becomes an ever more significant factor, necessitating the incorporation of Information Assurance principles throughout the electrical system-from central station power generating facilities, through transmission and distribution systems, to building management systems, distributed generation, home area networks, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. A precursor to determining the appropriate controls for any particular device within this complex system is to determine the trust model (or untrusted condition) within which the device exists. This paper, then, sets out to define a multilevel framework for an architecture to be used throughout the electrical system-a High-Assurance Smart Grid architecture that incorporates three core attributes:
   1) categorizes cybersecurity requirements based on a multi-tier determination of a subsystem's potential impact on the overall system;
   2) implements a robust defense-in-depth cybersecurity architecture;
   3) implements a distributed rather than hierarchical control system architecture based on an assumed compromise (untrusted condition) of system control components and subsystems using autoresponsive (AR) load control wherever possible.
   Multitier approach. It has been recognized by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and by the National Institute of Standards and Technology that a criticality model that simply defines grid controls as either critical or noncritical is insufficient. We therefore look to an analogous multitier system impact model from aviation that may provide a useful model for the power grid.
   Defense-in-depth. Best Practices in Information Technology use a set of protective systems in order to form a defense-in-depth approach to shield critical systems. The defense-in-depth principle is more than a ploy to "keep out" threats; rather it assumes the threat may already exist within the environment, whether through malicious intent or the mistaken actions of untrained or distracted personnel. As the electrical system is transformed through the introduction of significant numbers of intelligent electronic devices, the value of incorporating more cybersecurity controls from the IT domain is recognized as being of increasing importance.
   Assume compromise of control systems and implement AR load control where possible. Rather than attempting to create an all encompassing enclave of trust, the control system architectural model proposed here suggests systems should be designed with the expectation that adjacent systems will be compromised, understanding that an expansive sphere of implied trust inevitably leads to an expansive sphere of vulnerability. Holding an expectation of compromise-a lack of trust (untrusted condition)-is the preferable stance, because it in turn requires that subsystems implement independent rather than dependent cybersecurity and energy control data flows and allows evolving threats to be countered without continual system updates.
   Once an assumption is made that every command and control (C2) system has a variety of failure modes, consideration should be given to determining where the use of explicit C2 can be avoided while still achieving some of the goals the C2 system is intended to provide. Many demand-response (DR) functions exist to enable operating utilities to reduce loads in anticipation of or in response to grid overload conditions. AR load control can provide the desired DR without the need to build hierarchical C2 capabilities all the way back to the control room. Thus the distributed nature of the recommended architectural approach incorporates both distributed-but-collaborative decision making and autonomous decision making.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to advance knowledge of the transformative potential of big data on city-based transport models. The central question guiding this paper is: how could big data transform smart city transport operations? In answering this question the authors present initial results from a Markov study. However the authors also suggest caution in the transformation potential of big data and highlight the risks of city and organizational adoption. A theoretical framework is presented together with an associated scenario which guides the development of a Markov model.
   Design/methodology/approach - A model with several scenarios is developed to explore a theoretical framework focussed on matching the transport demands (of people and freight mobility) with city transport service provision using big data. This model was designed to illustrate how sharing transport load (and capacity) in a smart city can improve efficiencies in meeting demand for city services.
   Findings - This modelling study is an initial preliminary stage of the investigation in how big data could be used to redefine and enable new operational models. The study provides new understanding about load sharing and optimization in a smart city context. Basically the authors demonstrate how big data could be used to improve transport efficiency and lower externalities in a smart city. Further how improvement could take place by having a car free city environment, autonomous vehicles and shared resource capacity among providers.
   Research limitations/implications - The research relied on a Markov model and the numerical solution of its steady state probabilities vector to illustrate the transformation of transport operations management (OM) in the future city context. More in depth analysis and more discrete modelling are clearly needed to assist in the implementation of big data initiatives and facilitate new innovations in OM. The work complements and extends that of Setia and Patel (2013), who theoretically link together information system design to operation absorptive capacity capabilities.
   Practical implications - The study implies that transport operations would actually need to be re-organized so as to deal with lowering CO2 footprint. The logistic aspects could be seen as a move from individual firms optimizing their own transportation supply to a shared collaborative load and resourced system. Such ideas are radical changes driven by, or leading to more decentralized rather than having centralized transport solutions (Caplice, 2013).
   Social implications - The growth of cities and urban areas in the twenty-first century has put more pressure on resources and conditions of urban life. This paper is an initial first step in building theory, knowledge and critical understanding of the social implications being posed by the growth in cities and the role that big data and smart cities could play in developing a resilient and sustainable transport city system.
   Originality/value - Despite the importance of OM to big data implementation, for both practitioners and researchers, we have yet to see a systematic analysis of its implementation and its absorptive capacity contribution to building capabilities, at either city system or organizational levels. As such the Markov model makes a preliminary contribution to the literature integrating big data capabilities with OM capabilities and the resulting improvements in system absorptive capacity.

AB While bubble plumes have been acoustically imaged in the water column above marine gas hydrate deposits in many studies, little is known about the temporal variation in plume intensity. In July 2008, we conducted surveys using 3.5 and 12 kHz echosounders and a 75 kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) over the northern and southern summits of Hydrate Ridge, on the Cascadia continental margin. Our study included multiple surveys at both sites, including a survey of the northern summit that was repeated 16 times in 19 h. Seafloor depth at the northern summit is 600 m, well within the hydrate stability zone (HSZ), which was below similar to 510 m during our survey based on CTD data. Three distinct flares (a term used to denote the acoustic signature of bubble plumes) were detected at Northern Hydrate Ridge (NHR) and one was detected at Southern Hydrate Ridge (SHR), coincident with where flares were observed a decade ago, indicating that the supply of gas is stable on this time scale. High-resolution bathymetric surveys of NHR and SHR acquired with an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) flown similar to 50 m above the seafloor indicate that flare locations are correlated with a distinctive pattern of short-wavelength seafloor roughness, supporting the inference of long-term stability in the location of bubble expulsion sites. As in previous studies at Hydrate Ridge, flares were not detected with the 3.5 kHz echosounder but were clearly imaged at 12 kHz. By reprocessing routine shipboard ADCP data, we show that they are also observed in at 75 kHz, indicating that a wide range of bubble sizes is present. The intensity of the flares varied strongly with time. Two primary sources for flares were observed. One, located on the regional topographic high, showed continuous activity, with two times periods of particularly strong flares that are not correlated with tidal height The other, located on a local topographic high, shows a pulse of increased backscatter that occurred on a falling tide. While the time period of observation is not enough to constrain the effect of tidal changes in seafloor pressure on venting, the data suggest that tides are not the dominant factor controlling release of bubbles from the seafloor. The data support previously suggested models in which temporary sealing of vents by gas hydrate formation and breaking of these barriers as gas pressure builds up is responsible for "burp-like" pulses of gas expulsion. We also report the first observations of flares originating within the HSZ that extend well above the HSZ with little loss of backscatter intensity. These represent a new source of methane injection into the upper ocean and possibly the atmosphere. Flare extension above the HSZ may be due to coating of some bubbles by oil or biofilms or to inclusion of particulate matter (possibly including floating pieces of hydrate) in the plumes. Although this study provides tantalizing new information on both short-term variability in gas expulsion rate and long-term stability of vent sites, longer, well-calibrated observations that integrate bubble flux over entire vent fields as a function of time are needed to develop accurate models for the flux of methane into the ocean and atmosphere from seafloor methane vents.

TI <i>CITIZENS UNITED</i> AS BAD CORPORATE LAW
SO WISCONSIN LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID AGENCY PROBLEMS; GOVERNANCE; LIABILITY; RIGHTS; COSTS; FIRM; OWNERSHIP;
   FINANCE; ACCESS
AB In this Article we show that Citizens United v. FEC, arguably the most important First Amendment case of the new millennium, is as much about corporate law as it is about the First Amendment. Unfortunately, the reasoning in the opinion is predicated on a fundamental misconception about both the legal status and the fundamental nature of the corporation. Specifically, Citizens United, which prohibited the government from restricting independent expenditures for corporate communications, and held that corporations enjoy the same free speech rights to engage in political spending as human citizens, is grounded on the erroneous theory that corporations are "associations of citizens" rather than what they actually are: legally autonomous entities that are conceptually distinct from those who own their stock.
   We reject the Citizens United majority's conception of the corporation as an "associations of citizens" and reaffirm its status as an artificial, metaphysical, and legal construct that exists separate and apart from its investors. In fact, the entire point of the incorporation process is to permit the creation of a legal entity that is not an association of individuals, but rather a discrete legal entity whose rights and obligations are distinct from those of its creators, investors, managers, and other constituents.
   We observe the utter lack of any authority for the Citizens United majority's view that the corporation is an association of individuals. In light of pointing out that corporations are creatures of state law, not federal law, we argue that determinations about the nature of the corporation, such as whether the corporation is a distinct juridical entity or an association of individuals, should be made by reference to state law, not federal law. In Citizens United, the Court either ignored or misunderstood the traditional, universally-held state corporate law conception of the corporation and in so doing subjected American investors to suffer the involuntary use of their entrusted capital for speech that has no rational connection to their reason for investing. This is bad corporate law making bad constitutional law.
   We also identify an irony. It was the legislative branch, not the judicial branch that is supposedly more learned in the law, that was the one that understood corporate law when addressing political speech. Congress considered the nature of corporations when enacting McCain-Feingold and took into account that corporations are not associations of citizens, but separate, state-created entities formed for reasons that cannot be rationally attributed to the shared political or philosophical views of their investors. As such, Congress allowed corporations broad freedom to engage in political speech, but only by using funds voluntarily contributed for this purpose by stockholders to a corporate-controlled political action committee (PAC). By this means, Congress left ample room for the corporation to act as a collective vehicle for stockholders who wished to affiliate for that purpose, but protected other stockholders from being forced to subsidize speech that the mere decision to invest cannot plausibly be thought to endorse.
   By contrast, in Citizens United, the Court either ignored or misunderstood the traditional corporate law concept of the corporation and thereby subjected millions of American investors to suffer the involuntary use of their entrusted capital for speech that has no rational connection to their decision to buy stock. This is bad corporate law making bad constitutional law.

TI A cascaded deep-learning-based model for face mask detection
SO DATA TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Face mask detection; ResNet34; YOLO; SPP layer; Deep learning
ID RECOGNITION
AB Purpose This work aims to present a deep learning model for face mask detection in surveillance environments such as automatic teller machines (ATMs), banks, etc. to identify persons wearing face masks. In surveillance environments, complete visibility of the face area is a guideline, and criminals and law offenders commit crimes by hiding their faces behind a face mask. The face mask detector model proposed in this work can be used as a tool and integrated with surveillance cameras in autonomous surveillance environments to identify and catch law offenders and criminals. Design/methodology/approach The proposed face mask detector is developed by integrating the residual network (ResNet)34 feature extractor on top of three You Only Look Once (YOLO) detection layers along with the usage of the spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) layer to extract a rich and dense feature map. Furthermore, at the training time, data augmentation operations such as Mosaic and MixUp have been applied to the feature extraction network so that it can get trained with images of varying complexities. The proposed detector is trained and tested over a custom face mask detection dataset consisting of 52,635 images. For validation, comparisons have been provided with the performance of YOLO v1, v2, tiny YOLO v1, v2, v3 and v4 and other benchmark work present in the literature by evaluating performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, mean average precision (mAP) for the overall dataset and average precision (AP) for each class of the dataset. Findings The proposed face mask detector achieved 4.75-9.75 per cent higher detection accuracy in terms of mAP, 5-31 per cent higher AP for detection of faces with masks and, specifically, 2-30 per cent higher AP for detection of face masks on the face region as compared to the tested baseline variants of YOLO. Furthermore, the usage of the ResNet34 feature extractor and SPP layer in the proposed detection model reduced the training time and the detection time. The proposed face mask detection model can perform detection over an image in 0.45 s, which is 0.2-0.15 s lesser than that for other tested YOLO variants, thus making the proposed detection model perform detections at a higher speed. Research limitations/implications The proposed face mask detector model can be utilized as a tool to detect persons with face masks who are a potential threat to the automatic surveillance environments such as ATMs, banks, airport security checks, etc. The other research implication of the proposed work is that it can be trained and tested for other object detection problems such as cancer detection in images, fish species detection, vehicle detection, etc. Practical implications The proposed face mask detector can be integrated with automatic surveillance systems and used as a tool to detect persons with face masks who are potential threats to ATMs, banks, etc. and in the present times of COVID-19 to detect if the people are following a COVID-appropriate behavior of wearing a face mask or not in the public areas. Originality/value The novelty of this work lies in the usage of the ResNet34 feature extractor with YOLO detection layers, which makes the proposed model a compact and powerful convolutional neural-network-based face mask detector model. Furthermore, the SPP layer has been applied to the ResNet34 feature extractor to make it able to extract a rich and dense feature map.
   The other novelty of the present work is the implementation of Mosaic and MixUp data augmentation in the training network that provided the feature extractor with 3x images of varying complexities and orientations and further aided in achieving higher detection accuracy. The proposed model is novel in terms of extracting rich features, performing augmentation at the training time and achieving high detection accuracy while maintaining the detection speed.

AB This study presents the first detailed geomorphological characterization of field-scale geological features associated with hydrothermal systems in the southern Mariana Trough, using near-bottom swath mapping data collected by the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) Urashima during cruise YK09-08 and dive observation data acquired by the submersible Shinkai6500 during cruise YK10-11. The motivation of this study is to examine the relationship between geomorphological characteristics and hydrothermal activity, and to examine the nature of tectonic and volcanic controls on the hydrothermal system in this area. Two of the hydrothermal sites in the study area (near 12 degrees 57'N, 143 degrees 37'E) are located on the active backarc spreading axis (the Snail and Yamanaka sites), one is located at the eastern foot of the axial high (the Archean site), and two are located on an off-axis knoll about 5 km from the spreading axis (the Pika and Urashima sites). The on-axis area is divided into tectonically dominant and volcanically dominant zones; volcanically dominant zones are characterized by mounds (height, 5-30 m; diameter, 250-320 m) cut by fissures. The Snail and Yamanaka sites are located adjacent to these fissures, and are possibly represented local activity associated with a 4th order segment-scale diking event (on the basis of comparisons with previously studied cases on the East Pacific Rise with similar on-axis geological characteristics). In contrast to the on-axis sites, the off-axis sites show no evidence of faulting. The Archean site at the foot of the axial high is characterized by a single mound (height, 50-100; diameter, 250-300 m), pronounced off-axis lava flows, and the presence of high-amplitude rugged seafloor features; the site is located at the top of the mound. Numerous ridge lines (height, mainly 2-6 m) extend radially from the top of the mound, and several chimney-like structures (up to approximately 6 m high) occur on the top and slopes of the mound. The Pika site is located on the western peak of an off-axis knoll, and the newly discovered Urashima site is located at the northern foot of the western peak of the same knoll. The western peak is characterized by bumpy seabed textures formed by numerous smaller-scale mounds and ridge lines; however, the eastern peak has a very smooth top and slope, and shows no signs of hydrothermal activity. Numerous mounds (heights, 5-75 m; diameters, 50-350 m) are developed on the comparatively gentle slope of the knoll, in contrast to the numerous ridge lines (height, mainly 1-6 m) developed on the relatively steep slopes of the knoll. On the basis of the associated geomorphological features, the three off-axis sites (Archean, Pika, and Urashima) were identified as localities created by relatively long-term large-scale hydrothermal activity, as compared with sites in the on-axis area. The sustained activity at off-axis sites appears closely related to an off-axis upwelling magma system. The three off-axis hydrothermal sites are composed mainly of breccia assemblages that probably originated from hydrothermal activity with black smoker venting. These areas are characterized by numerous ridge lines, conical mounds, and bumpy seabed texture, whereas the on-axis sites are characterized by the absence of ridge lines, and the presence of white smoker and shimmering observed on dome-shaped pillow mounds. Hence, the distribution of ridge lines, mound morphology, and bumpy seabed texture is likely to correlate with hydrothermal activity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The development and implementation of a three-dimensional ocean modeling system for the Prince William Sound (PWS) is described. The system consists of a regional ocean model component (ROMS) forced by output from a regional atmospheric model component (the Weather Research and Forecasting Model, WRF). The ROMS ocean model component has a horizontal resolution of 1 km within PWS and utilizes a recently-developed multi-scale 3DVAR data assimilation methodology along with freshwater runoff from land obtained via real-time execution of a digital elevation model. During the Sound Predictions Field Experiment (July 19-August 3, 2009) the system was run in real-time to support operations and incorporated all available real-time streams of data. Nowcasts were produced every 6 h and a 48-h forecast was performed once a day. In addition, a sixteen-member ensemble of forecasts was executed on most days. All results were published at a web portal (http://ourocean.jpl.nasa.gov/PWS) in real time to support decision making.
   The performance of the system during Sound Predictions 2009 is evaluated. The ROMS results are first compared with the assimilated data as a consistency check. RMS differences of about 0.7 degrees C were found between the ROMS temperatures and the observed vertical profiles of temperature that are assimilated. The ROMS salinities show greater discrepancies, tending to be too salty near the surface. The overall circulation patterns observed throughout the Sound are qualitatively reproduced, including the following evolution in time. During the first week of the experiment, the weather was quite stormy with strong southeasterly winds. This resulted in strong north to northwestward surface flow in much of the central PWS. Both the observed drifter trajectories and the ROMS nowcasts showed strong surface inflow into the Sound through the Hinchinbrook Entrance and strong generally northward to northwestward flow in the central Sound that was exiting through the Knight Island Passage and Montague Strait entrance. During the latter part of the second week when surface winds were light and southwesterly, the mean surface flow at the Hinchinbrook Entrance reversed to weak outflow and a cyclonic eddy formed in the central Sound. Overall, RMS differences between ROMS surface currents and observed HF radar surface currents in the central Sound were generally between 5 and 10 cm/s, about 20-40% of the time mean current speeds.
   The ROMS reanalysis is then validated against independent observations. A comparison of the ROMS currents with observed vertical current profiles from moored ADCPs in the Hinchinbrook Entrance and Montague Strait shows good qualitative agreement and confirms the evolution of the near surface inflow/outflow at these locations described above. A comparison of the ROMS surface currents with drifter trajectories provided additional confirmation that the evolution of the surface flow described above was realistic. Forecasts of drifter locations had RMS errors of less than 10 km for up to 36 h. One and two-day forecasts of surface temperature, salinity and current fields were more skillful than persistence forecasts. In addition, ensemble mean forecasts were found to be slightly more skillful than single forecasts. Two case studies demonstrated the system's qualitative skill in predicting subsurface changes within the mixed layer measured by ships and autonomous underwater vehicles. In summary, the system is capable of producing a realistic evolution of the near-surface circulation within PWS including forecasts of up to two days of this evolution. Use of the products provided by the system during the experiment as part of the asset deployment decision making process demonstrated the value of accurate regional ocean forecasts in support of field experiments.

AB Societal concerns over the potential impacts of recent global change have prompted renewed interest in the long term ecological monitoring of large ecosystems The deep sea is the largest ecosystem on the planet the least accessible and perhaps the least understood Nevertheless deep sea data collected over the last few decades are now being synthesised with a view to both measuring global change and predicting the future impacts of further rises in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations For many years it was assumed by many that the deep sea is a stable habitat buffered from short term changes in the atmosphere or upper ocean However recent studies suggest that deep seafloor ecosystems may respond relatively quickly to seasonal inter annual and decadal scale shifts in upper ocean variables In this review we assess the evidence for these long term (i e inter annual to decadal scale) changes both in biologically driven sedimented deep sea ecosystems (e g abyssal plains) and in chemosynthetic ecosystems that are partially geologically driven such as hydrothermal vents and cold seeps We have identified 11 deep sea sedimented ecosystems for which published analyses of long term biological data exist At three of these we have found evidence for a progressive trend that could be potentially linked to recent climate change although the evidence is not conclusive At the other sites we have concluded that the changes were either not significant or were stochastically variable without being clearly linked to climate change or climate variability indices For chemosynthetic ecosystems we have identified 14 sites for which there are some published long term data Data for temporal changes at chemosynthetic ecosystems are scarce with few sites being subjected to repeated visits However the limited evidence from hydrothermal vents suggests that at fast spreading centres such as the East Pacific Rise vent communities are impacted on decadal scales by stochastic events such as volcanic eruptions with associated fauna showing complex patterns of community succession For the slow spreading centres such as the Mid Atlantic Ridge vent sites appear to be stable over the time periods measured with no discernable long term trend At cold seeps inferences based on spatial studies in the Gulf of Mexico and data on organism longevity suggest that these sites are stable over many hundreds of years However at the Haakon Mosby mud volcano a large well studied seep in the Barents Sea periodic mud slides associated with gas and fluid venting may disrupt benthic communities leading to successional sequences over time For chemosynthetic ecosystems of biogenic origin (e g whale falls) it is likely that the longevity of the habitat depends mainly on the size of the carcass and the ecological setting with large remains persisting as a distinct seafloor habitat for up to loo years Studies of shallow water analogs of deep sea ecosystems such as marine caves may also yield insights into temporal processes Although it is obvious from the geological record that past climate change has impacted deep sea faunas the evidence that recent climate change or climate variability has altered deep sea benthic communities is extremely limited This mainly reflects the lack of remote sensing of this vast seafloor habitat Current and future advances in deep ocean benthic science involve new remote observing technologies that combine a high temporal resolution (e g cabled observatories) with spatial capabilities (e g autonomous vehicles undertaking image surveys of the seabed)

AB Six E-glass/Epoxy shallow water composite pressure vessels with effective length of 45.72 cm and inner diameter of 33.02 cm were designed, analyzed, manufactured, and tested for an external hydrostatic design pressure of 1.14 MPa that corresponds to a depth of 91 m in ocean. Composite pressure vessels were designed as composite cylinders fabricated by roll-wrapping and enclosed by two flat plug-supported end-caps due to their ease of manufacturing and cost-effectiveness. The plug-supported end-caps had a combination of tapered contour and initial radial clearance to account for bending and shear stresses in composite cylinders at the end-cap locations. Buckling and stress finite element analyses were performed for the design of the pressure vessels. An eigenvalue buckling analysis was performed to determine a bifurcation buckling pressure (2.51 MPa) and a modal shape of the structure for a wall-thickness of 7.72 mm based on 32 layers of 0.2413 mm thick each. These results were then used to perform a nonlinear buckling analysis. The nonlinear buckling pressure was determined to be 1.42 MPa yielding a buckling pressure factor of safety of 1.25. Stress analysis was performed to investigate the stress response of the structure with the wall-thickness of 7.72 mm under the design pressure. Maximum stress and strain criteria were used and stress and strain factor of safety of 11.95 and 17.17 were achieved, respectively. The composite pressure vessels were made of plain weave E-glass/Epoxy fabric. A comparative study of various materials property modeling for woven materials was performed and reported in this work. The three-dimensional Crimp model was explained and employed in this investigation to model the effective properties of a woven composite material, and the results were compared with other existing models.
   In addition, general guidelines to model the effective properties of woven hybrid materials are also provided. Tube rollwrapping with wet-laying technique was used to fabricate the pressure vessels. This technique consisted of several steps, namely set-up preparation, fabric impregnation, fabric rolling, shrink taping, curing and cooling, and post-processing. The total time of manufacturing was 7 h for each pressure vessel. The final products needed minor machining. The final total length, inner diameter, and thickness of the manufactured pressure vessels were 49.53 cm, 33.02 cm, and 8.23 mm, based on 32 cured layers, respectively. An average fiber volume fraction of 55% and an average porosity content of 5% was achieved. The fiber waviness due to the fiber migration during the manufacturing under the cylinder compaction was in the order of the waviness of the woven material due to its weave undulation. End-caps were designed using Aluminum 6061-T6 employing Von Mises criterion. The end-caps have seven holes, which are used to place the connectors and a vacuum bolt. The stress factor of safety of 4.2 was achieved for the end-caps. Aluminum 6061-T6 end-caps with 2.9 cm thickness were fabricated. An axial washer and two radial O-rings were used to seal the pressure vessel/end-caps interfaces. The pressure vessels and end-caps were assembled using six tie-rods. Six pressure vessels were tested at the external hydrostatic design pressure of 1.14 MPa inside a high-pressure water-tilled chamber. The pressure vessels were intact and no leakage was observed. The pressure vessels were strain gauged during the testing to compare the experimental and finite element analysis results of axial and hoop strains at the mid-length as well as the vicinity of the end-caps for composite cylinders, and excellent agreements were achieved.

   approach and lessons for the future

AB The optimal liability framework for AI systems remains an unsolved problem across the globe. With ChatGPT and other large generative models taking the technology to the next level, solutions are urgently needed. In a much-anticipated move, the European Commis-sion advanced two proposals outlining the European approach to AI liability in September 2022: a novel AI Liability Directive (AILD) and a revision of the Product Liability Directive (PLD). They constitute the final cornerstone of AI regulation in the EU. Crucially, the liability proposals and the proposed EU AI Act are inherently intertwined: the latter does not con-tain any individual rights of affected persons, and the former lack specific, substantive rules on AI development and deployment. Taken together, these acts may well trigger a "Brussels effect" in AI regulation, with significant consequences for the US and other countries.Against this background, this paper makes three novel contributions. First, it examines in detail the liability proposals and shows that, while making steps in the right direction, they ultimately represent a half-hearted approach: if enacted as foreseen, AI liability in the EU will primarily rest on disclosure of evidence mechanisms and a set of narrowly defined presumptions concerning fault, defectiveness and causality.Hence, second, the article suggests amendments to the proposed AI liability framework. They are collected in a concise Annex at the end of the paper. I argue, inter alia, that the dichotomy between the fault-based AILD Proposal and the supposedly strict liability PLD Proposal is fictional and should be abandoned; that an EU framework for AI liability should comprise one fully harmonizing regulation instead of two insufficiently coordinated direc-tives; and that the current proposals unjustifiably collapse fundamental distinctions be-tween social and individual risk by equating high-risk AI systems in the AI Act with those under the liability framework.Third, based on an analysis of the key risks AI poses, the final part of the paper maps out a road for the future of AI liability and regulation, in the EU and beyond. More specif-ically, I make four key proposals. Effective compensation should be ensured by combin-ing truly strict liability for certain high-risk AI systems with general presumptions of de-fectiveness, fault and causality in cases involving SMEs or non-high-risk AI systems. The paper introduces a novel distinction between illegitimate-and legitimate-harm models to delineate strict liability's scope. Truly strict liability should be reserved for high-risk AI sys-tems that, from a social perspective, should not cause harm (illegitimate-harm models, e.g., autonomous vehicles or medical AI). Models meant to cause some unavoidable harm by ranking and rejecting individuals (legitimate-harm models, e.g., credit scoring or insurance scoring) may merely face rebuttable presumptions of defectiveness and causality. General-purpose AI systems and Foundation Models should only be subjected to high-risk regulation, including liability for high-risk AI systems, in specific high-risk use cases for which they are deployed. Consumers, in turn, ought to be liable based on regular fault, in general.Furthermore, innovation and legal certainty should be fostered through a comprehen-sive regime of safe harbours, defined quantitatively to the best extent possible. Moreover, trustworthy AI remains an important goal for AI regulation.
   Hence, the liability framework must specifically extend to non-discrimination cases and provide for clear rules concerning explainability (XAI).Finally, awareness for the climate effects of AI, and digital technology more broadly, is rapidly growing in computer science. In diametrical opposition to this shift in discourse and understanding, however, EU legislators have long neglected environmental sustainabil-ity in both the draft AI Act and the proposed liability regime. To counter this, I propose to jump-start sustainable AI regulation via sustainability impact assessments in the AI Act and sustainable design defects in the liability regime. In this way, the law may help spur not only fair AI and XAI, but also sustainable AI (SAI).(c) 2023 Philipp Hacker. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   challenges
SO AIRCRAFT ENGINEERING AND AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Agricultural onboard sensors; Agricultural UAV; UAV's sensors
ID UAS
AB Purpose
   The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) entered into their development stage when different applications became real. One of those application areas is agriculture. Agriculture and transport currently follow infrastructure as the top industries in the world UAV market. The agricultural UAV can be acquired as a ready-made, built by its future user or UAV-as-a-service (UaaS) way. This paper aims to help the UAVs' users to choose the right sensors for agricultural purposes. For that sake, the overview of the types and application areas of onboard sensors is presented and discussed. Some conclusions and suggestions should allow readers to choose the proper onboard sensors set and the right way of acquiring UAVs for their purposes related to the agricultural area.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The agricultural UAVs' onboard specialised sensors have been analysed, described and evaluated from the farmer's operational point of view. That analysis took into consideration the agricultural UAVs' types of missions, sensor characteristics, basics of the data processing software and the whole set of UAV-sensor-software operational features. As the conclusions, the trends in the onboard agricultural UAVs' sensors, their applications and operational characteristics have been presented.
   Findings
   Services performed by the UAVs for the agriculture businesses are the second in the UAV services world market, and their growth potential is around 17% compound annual growth rate in the next years. As one of the quickest developing businesses, it will attract substantial investments in all related areas. They will be done in the research, development and market deployment stages of that technology development. The authors can expect the new business models of the equipment manufacturers, service providers and sellers of the equipment, consumables and materials. The world agricultural UAVs' services market will be divided between the following two main streams: the UAVs' solutions dedicated to the individual farmers, systems devoted to the companies giving the specialised services to individual farmers, in the form of UaaS. It will be followed by the two directions of the agriculture UAV set optimisation, according to each of the above streams' specific requirements and expectations. Solutions for the individual users will be more straightforward, universal and more comfortable to operate but less effective and less accurate than systems dedicated to the agricultural service provider. UAVs are becoming important universal machines in the agriculture business. They are the newcomers in that business but can change the processes performed traditionally. Such an example is spraying the crops. UAVs spray the rice fields in Japan on at least half of them every year. The other is defoliating the cotton leaves, which only in one China province takes place on a few million hectares every year (Kurkute et al., 2018). That trend will extend the range of applications of UAVs. The agricultural UAV will take over process after process from the traditional machines. The types and number of missions and activities performed by agricultural UAVs are growing. They are strictly connected with the development of hardware and software responsible for those missions' performance. New onboard sensors are more reliable, have better parameters and their prices are reasonable. Onboard computers and data processing and transmitting methods allow for effective solutions of automatisation and autonomy of the agricultural UAVs' operation.
   Automatisation and autonomous performance of the UAVs' agricultural missions are the main directions of the future development of that technology. Changing the UAV payload allows for its application to a different mission. Changing the payload, like effectors, is quite simple and does not require any special training or tooling. It can be done in the field during the regular operation of the agricultural UAV. Changing the sensor set can be more complicated, because of the eventually required calibrating of those sensors. The same set of sensors gives a possibility to perform a relatively broad range of missions and tasks. The universal setup consists of the multispectral and RGB camera. The agricultural UAV equipped with such a set of sensors can effectively perform most of the crop monitoring missions. The agriculture business will accept the optimised sensor-computer-software UAV payload set, where its exploitation cost and operational simplicity are the critical optimisation factors. Simplicity, reliability and effectiveness of the everyday operation are the vital factors of accepting the agricultural UAV technology as a widespread working horse.
   Research limitations/implications
   Performed research studies have been done taking into consideration the factors influencing the real operational decisions made by the farmers or companies offering UAV services to them. In that case, e.g. the economical factors have been considered, which could prevail the technical complexity or measuring accuracy of the sensors. Then, drawn conclusions can be not accurate from the scientific research studies point of view, where the financing limits are not so strict.
   Practical implications
   The main goal of the paper is to present the reasons and factors influencing the "optimised" solution of the configuration of agricultural UAV onboard sensors set. It was done at the level useful for the readers understanding the end-users expectations and having a basic understanding of the sensors-related technologies. The paper should help them to configure an acceptable agricultural UAV for the specific missions or their servicing business.
   Social implications
   Understanding the technology implications related to the applying of agricultural UAVs into everyday service is one of the main limits of that technology market deployment. The conclusions should allow for avoiding the misunderstanding of the agricultural UAVs' capabilities and then increasing their social acceptance. That acceptance by the farmers is the key factor for the effective introduction of that technology into the operation.
   Originality/value
   Presented conclusions have been drawn on the base of the extensive research of the existing literature and web pages, and also on the own experience in forestry and agriculture and other technical applications of the onboard sensors. The experience in practical aspects of the sensors choosing and application into several areas have been also used, e.g. manned and unmanned aeroplanes and helicopters applied in similar and other types of missions.
