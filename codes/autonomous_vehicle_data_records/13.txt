AB Drone autonomous operations near power lines are growing steadily and require innovative techniques to keep them on air. This paper presents a novel electromechanical recharging station that can be mounted on energized AC power line to charge the drone battery wirelessly without a need to modify the electrical infrastructure. The work shows a thorough analysis of the electrical and mechanical core components to build a flexible, lightweight and efficient recharging station that can be attached to a robotic arm. The work also discusses the recharging station design and its special robot end effector that mechanically couples the station with an aerial manipulator. Finally, the recharging station has been tested in the lab and in a real power line setup to validate its design and efficiency. The total achieved mass is 2300 grams with a harvesting efficiency of 77% at 250 A primary current.

AB The anthropomorphic intelligence of autonomous driving has been a research hotspot in the world. However, current studies have not been able to reveal the mechanism of drivers' natural driving behaviors. Therefore, this thesis starts from the perspective of cognitive decision-making in the human brain, which is inspired by the regulation of dopamine feedback in the basal ganglia, and a reinforcement learning model is established to solve the brain-like intelligent decision-making problems in the process of interacting with the environment. In this thesis, first, a detailed bionic mechanism architecture based on basal ganglia was proposed by the consideration and analysis of its feedback regulation mechanism; second, the above mechanism was transformed into a reinforcement Q-learning model, so as to implement the learning and adaptation abilities of an intelligent vehicle for brain-like intelligent decision-making during car-following; finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method were verified by the simulations and real vehicle tests.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) outfitted with manipulators are useful for performing various tasks. As the AUVs manipulate tools, they deviate from neutral buoyancy, and must constantly actuate to maintain depth and orientation. This results in large energy consumption. Furthermore, AUVs continuously oscillate when thrusters are unable to fix minor motion discrepancies. This letter investigates the use of reversible fuel cells-enabled buoyancy control devices (BCDs, soft actuators) with existing thrusters (hard actuators) to correct the heave and tilt motion during tool manipulation. A state-space model that describes an AUV equippped with a manipulator and actuated with thrusters and BCDs is derived. A set of control laws are proposed to allow for a novel collaboration between the two actuators (thrusters and BCDs) for station keeping. Different scenarios are simulated using the model with experimentally identified parameters to analyze the motion and energy performance of the control law. Simulation results show that synergizing the two forms of actuation (soft/hard) improves performance and energy efficiency with the thrusters providing quick depth and orientation correction while BCDs adjust buoyancy and small maneuvering.

AB In the control systems community, path-following refers to the problem of tracking an output reference curve. This work presents a novel model predictive path-following control formulation for nonlinear systems with constraints, extended with an obstacle avoidance strategy. The method proposed in this work simultaneously provides an optimizing solution for both, path-following and obstacle avoidance tasks in a single optimization problem, using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). The main idea consists in extending the existing NMPC controllers by the introduction of an additional auxiliary trajectory that maintains the feasibility of the successive optimization problems even when the reference curve is unfeasible, possibly discontinuous, relaxing assumptions required in previous works. The obstacle avoidance is fulfilled by introducing additional terms in the value functional, rather than imposing state space constraints, with the aim of maintaining the convexity of the state and output spaces. Simulations results considering an autonomous vehicle subject to input and state constraints are carried out to illustrate the performance of the proposed control strategy.

AB With the development of sensor technology, sensor nodes are increasingly being used in underwater environments. The strategy presented in this paper is designed to solve the problem of using a limited number of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to complete tasks such as data collection from sensor nodes when the number of AUVs is less than the number of target sensors. A novel classified self-organising map algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. First, according to the K-means algorithm, targets are classified into groups that are determined by the number of AUVs. Second, according to the self-organising map algorithm, AUVs are matched with groups. Third, each AUV is provided with the accessible order of the targets in the group. The novel classified self-organising map algorithm can be used not only to reduce the total energy consumption in a multi-AUV system, but also to give the most efficient accessible order of targets for AUVs. Results of simulations conducted to prove the applicability of the algorithm are given.

AB This paper establishes the method of controlled Lagrangian particle tracking (CLPT) to analyze the offsets between physical positions of marine robots in the ocean and simulated positions of controlled particles in an ocean model. The offset, which we term the CLPT error, demonstrates distinguished characteristics not previously seen in drifters and floats that cannot be actively controlled. The CLPT error growth over time is exponential until it reaches a turning point that only depends on the resolution of the ocean model. After this turning point, the error growth slows down significantly to polynomial functions of time. In the ideal case, a theoretical upper threshold on exponential growth of CLPT error can be derived. These characteristics are proved theoretically, verified via simulation, and justified with ocean experimental data. The method of CLPT may be applied to improve the accuracy of ocean circulation models and the performance of navigation algorithms for marine robots.

DE Autonomy; ethology-based behavior control; hybrid control architecture
AB In this paper, we propose a control architecture for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), implemented in a hybrid architecture with two layers: a hierarchical planning layer and a reactive execution layer. Most of its tasks are interpreted as a set of waypoints and then specified actions at the points. Thus, in the planning layer, the task planner is designed as a waypoint planner using a genetic algorithm. This planner generates an optimized plan, considering given constraints such as positions of obstacles, current velocities, and task priority. In addition, the execution of the task plan is monitored by a mission supervisor, which determines ongoing tasks and can change the original plan if exceptional events occur. In the execution layer, a behavior-based control with an ethology-based action selectionmechanismis implemented. As a result, the AUV can always choose the most appropriate behavior, maximizing itsmotivation, and the robot is controlled by the output of the selected behavior. Consequently, the proposed control architecture has an open and modular structure. Numerical simulations were conducted to verify its performance.

AB The benthic communities of the deep insular shelf at the Hind Bank marine conservation district (MCD), an important spawning aggregation site for groupers, were studied with the Seabed autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) at depths between 32 and 54m. Four digital phototransects provided data on benthic species composition and abundance of the insular shelf off St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands. Within the western side of the MCD, well-developed coral reefs with 43% mean living coral cover were found. The Montastrea annularis complex was dominant at all four sites between 33 and 47 in, the depth range where reefs were present. Maximum coral cover found was 70% at depths of 38-40m. Quantitative determinations of sessile benthic populations, as well as the presence of motile megabenthic invertebrates and algae were obtained. The Seabed AUV provided new quantitative and descriptive information of a unique coral reef habitat found within this deeper insular shelf area. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The urban traffic system is most likely to change in the next years to a mixed traffic with human drivers, vulnerable road users, and automated vehicles. In the past, the development of external communication approaches for automated vehicles focused on scenarios where an automated vehicle communicates with either a pedestrian or a human driver. However, interactions with more than one traffic partner are more realistic. Therefore, a study with 42 participants was conducted with a multi-agent simulation in which an automated vehicle interacted simultaneously with two participants, a pedestrian and a driver of a manual vehicle. In this study, two main scenarios were investigated in order to evaluate the safety and efficiency of the interactions and to determine whether the human road users feel correctly addressed. In one scenario, the pedestrian had to cross the road in front of the automated and the manual vehicle, which were approaching from different sides. In the other, the manual vehicle had to drive through a bottleneck in front of the oncoming automated vehicle, while the pedestrian had to cross the road after both vehicles passed. The communication approach of the automated vehicle consisted of implicit signals using a speed profile and lateral offset within its lane, and explicit signals using an external human-machine interface. The results of the study show that no collisions were observed in terms of safety and no significant negative effects on efficiency were measured. However, in contrast to single agent interactions, a majority of participants felt wrongly addressed in situations where the automated vehicle signals the right-of-way to the other human road user. It can be concluded that the communication approach of the automated vehicle needs to be modified in order to address certain road users more clearly.

AB Ubiquitous systems and applications involve interactions between multiple autonomous entities-for example, robots in a mobile ad-hoc network collaborating to achieve a goal, communications between teams of emergency workers involved in disaster relief operations or interactions between patients' and healthcare workers' mobile devices. We have previously proposed the Self-Managed Cell (SMC) as an architectural pattern for managing autonomous ubiquitous systems that comprise both hardware and software components and that implement policy-based adaptation strategies. We have also shown how basic management interactions between autonomous SMCs can be realised through exchanges of notifications and policies, to effectively program management and context-aware adaptations. We present here how autonomous SMCs can be composed and federated into complex structures through the systematic composition of interaction patterns. By composing simpler abstractions as building blocks of more complex interactions it is possible to leverage commonalities across the structural, control and communication views to manage a broad variety of composite autonomous systems including peer-to-peer collaborations, federations and aggregations with varying degrees of devolution of control. Although the approach is more broadly applicable, we focus on systems where declarative policies are used to specify adaptation and on context-aware ubiquitous systems that present some degree of autonomy in the physical world, such as body sensor networks and autonomous vehicles. Finally, we present a formalisation of our model that allows a rigorous verification of the properties satisfied by the SMC interactions before policies are deployed in physical devices.

ID MACHINES; ARCHITECTURE; SYSTEMS
AB This paper addresses the multi-fault diagnosis problem of thrusters and sensors for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Traditional support vector domain description (SVDD) has low classification accuracy in the process of AUV multi-fault pattern classification because of the effect of sample sparse density and the uneven distribution of samples, and so on. Thus, a fuzzy weighted support vector domain description (FWSVDD) method based on positive and negative class samples is proposed. In this method, the negative class sample is introduced during classifier training, and the local density and the class weight are introduced for each sample. To improve the multi-fault pattern classifier training speed and fault diagnosis accuracy of FWSVDD, a multi-fault mode classification method based on a hierarchical strategy is proposed. This method adds fault contain detection surface for each thruster and sensor to isolate fault components during fault diagnosis. By considering the problem of pattern classification for a fuzzy sample, which may be located in the overlapping area of hyper-spheres or may not belong to any hyper-sphere in the process of multi-fault classification based on FWSVDD, a relative distance judgment method is given. The effectiveness of the proposed multi-fault diagnosis approach is demonstrated through water tank experiments with an experimental AUV prototype.

AB Rangeland comprises as much as 70% of the Earth's land surface area. Much of this vast space is in very remote areas that are expensive and often impossible to access on the ground. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have great potential for rangeland management. UAVs have several advantages over satellites and piloted aircraft: they can be deployed quickly and repeatedly; they are less costly and safer than piloted aircraft; they are flexible in terms of flying height and timing of missions; and they can obtain imagery at sub-decimeter resolution. This hyperspatial imagery allows for quantification of plant cover, composition, and structure at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments have shown that this capability, from an off-the-shelf mini-UAV, is directly applicable to operational agency needs for measuring and monitoring. For use by operational agencies to carry out their mandated responsibilities, various requirements must be met: an affordable and reliable platform; a capability for autonomous, low altitude flights; takeoff and landing in small areas surrounded by rugged terrain; and an easily applied data analysis methodology. A number of image processing and orthorectification challenges have been or are currently being addressed, but the potential to depict the land surface commensurate with field data perspectives across broader spatial extents is unrivaled.

AB Autonomous vehicles have become a hot spot of the automotive industry, many cities have claimed that autonomous vehicles should be capable of recognizing gestures used by traffic police. Traditional traffic police gesture recognition methods rely on depth-sensor or wearable-devices, which limits their availability in the domain of the intelligent vehicle. Vision-based methods have fewer requirements for distance, but the modeling process is challenging due to the complexity of the visual scenes. Inspired by the recent success in vision-based pose estimation networks such as Convolutional Pose Machine (CPM), in this paper, we propose a novel vision-based human-machine interface to recognize eight kinds of Chinese traffic police gestures and apply it in the real-time recognition tasks. This method integrates a modified CPM network and two kinds of handcrafted features: Relative Bone Length and Angle with Gravity as spatial domain features, and adopt a Long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract temporal domain features. To train and validate our method, we create a gestures dataset with two hours of traffic police gesture videos, which has 3354 gesture instances. The experiment results show that the proposed method is capable of recognizing traffic police gestures, and is fast enough for online gesture prediction. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this article, we address the determination of turning radius and lateral acceleration acting on a vehicle up to 3.5 t gross vehicle mass (GVM) and cargo in curves based on turning radius and speed. Global Navigation Satellite System with Inertial Navigation System (GNSS/INS) dual-antenna sensor is used to measure acceleration, speed, and vehicle position to determine the turning radius and determine the proper formula to calculate long average lateral acceleration acting on vehicle and cargo. The two methods for automatic selection of events were applied based on stable lateral acceleration value and on mean square error (MSE) of turning radiuses. The models of calculation of turning radius are valid for turning radius within 5-70 m for both methods of automatic selection of events with mean root mean square error (RMSE) 1.88 m and 1.32 m. The models of calculation of lateral acceleration are valid with mean RMSE of 0.022 g and 0.016 g for both methods of automatic selection of events. The results of the paper may be applied in the planning and implementation of packing and cargo securing procedures to calculate average lateral acceleration acting on vehicle and cargo based on turning radius and speed for vehicles up to 3.5 t GVM. The results can potentially be applied for the deployment of autonomous vehicles in solutions grouped under the term of Logistics 4.0.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles with onboard computing units foster innovative approaches for sampling oceanographic phenomena. Feedback of observations via the onboard model for planning algorithms enable adaptive sampling for such robotic units. In this work, we develop, implement, and test an adaptive sampling algorithm for efficient sampling of water masses in a 3-D frontal system. Focusing on a river plume, salinity variations are used to characterize the water masses. A threshold in salinity is assumed to distinguish the ocean and river waters, so that excursions below the threshold define river waters. The onboard model builds on a Gaussian random field representation of the salinity variations in (north, east, depth) coordinates. This model is initially trained from numerical ocean model data, and then updated with data gathered by the vehicle sensor. The Gaussian random field model further allows closed-form expressions of the expected spatially integrated Bernoulli variance of the salinity excursion set, which is used to reward sampling efforts. Combining these results with forward-looking planning algorithms, we suggest a workflow for 3-D adaptive sampling to map river plume systems. Simulation studies are used to compare the suggested approach with others. Results of field trials in the Nidelva river plume in Norway are presented and discussed.

A key feature for this kind of vehicle is object detection, which is commonly performed in 2D space. This has some inherent issues as an object and the depiction of such an object would be classified as the actual object, which is inadequate since urban environments are full of billboards, printed adverts and posters that would likely make these systems fail. In order to overcome this problem, a 3D sensor could be leveraged, although this would make the platform more expensive, energy inefficient and computationally complex. Thus, we propose the use of structure from motion to reconstruct the three-dimensional information of the scene from a set of images, and merge the 2D and 3D data to differentiate actual objects from depictions. As expected, our approach is able to work with a regular color camera. No 3D sensors whatsoever are required. As the experiments confirm, our approach is able to distinguish between actual pedestrians and depictions of them more than 87% of times in synthetic and real-world tests in the worst scenarios, while the accuracy is of almost 98% in the best case.

AB Our previous work focused on the creation of a binary integer model framework aiming at network level traffic optimization through the control of individual vehicles. High computational demand arising from time and space discretization has been identified as the main limitation of the concept. To deal with this, new methods are presented in this paper in order to reduce the complexity of the optimization process with a particular emphasis on system safety. In the first step the most relevant hazards of the system were identified and they were used as the basics of the further development process. The effects are quantified implying a significantly reduced computational demand, without threatening the feasibility of the results. Considering the fundamental requirement of ensuring safe traffic, novel methods are introduced to determine the safety level of the results provided by our model and the described hazard types. The safety indicators defined here cover factors related to the crossing movements, the average speed and average change in speed of vehicles, investigating them also at the network level. The presented methods have significant potential related to the design of real-time, safety-focused, and effective transport management processes of connected and automated mobility systems.

AB Kinematic global positioning system (GPS) positioning and underwater acoustic ranging can combine to locate an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with an accuracy of +/- 30 cm (2-sigma) in the global International Terrestrial Reference Frame 2000 (ITRF2000). An array of three precision transponders, separated by approximately 700 m, was established on the seafloor in 300-m-deep waters off San Diego. Each transponder's horizontal position was determined with an accuracy of +/- 8 cm (2-sigma) by measuring two-way travel times with microsecond resolution between transponders and a shipboard transducer, positioned to +/- 10 cm (2-sigma) in ITRF2000 coordinates with GPS, as the ship circled each seafloor unit. Travel times measured from AUV to ship and from AUV to transponders to ship were differenced and combined with AUV depth from a pressure gauge to estimate ITRF2000 positions of the AUV to +/- 1 m (2-sigma). Simulations show that +/- 30 cm (2-sigma) absolute positioning of the AUV can be realized by replacing the time-difference approach with directly measured two-way travel times between AUV and seafloor transponders. Submeter absolute positioning of underwater vehicle!; in water depths up to several thousand meters is practical. The limiting factor is knowledge of near-surface sound speed which degrades the precision to which transponders can be located in the ITRF2000 frame.

AB Current collision avoidance techniques deployed on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) rely on short-range sensors, such as proximity sensors, cameras, and microphones. Unfortunately, their efficiency is significantly limited in several situations; for instance, when a remote UAV approaches at high velocity, or when the surrounding environment is impaired (e.g., fog, noise). In the cited cases, to avoid collisions and maintain self-separation, UAVs often rely on the indiscriminate broadcast of their location. Therefore, an adversary could easily identify the location of the UAV and attack it, e.g., by physically shutting it down, launching wireless jamming attacks, or continuing tracking its movements. To address the above-introduced threats, in this article we present PPCA, a lightweight, distributed, and privacy-preserving scheme to avoid collisions among UAVs. Our solution, based on an ingenious tessellation of the space, is accompanied by a thorough analytical model and is supported by an extensive experimental campaign performed on a real 3DR-Solo drone. The achieved results are striking: PPCA can efficiently and effectively avoid collisions among UAVs, by requiring a limited bandwidth and computational overhead (84.85% less than traditional privacy-preserving proximity testing approaches), while providing unique benefits in terms of privacy of the participating UAVs.

AB In this article, different state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms are analyzed to incorporate the collision-free path-planning approach for UAVs in a disaster situation. The efficient path planning is used to identify the main cause of disaster like bushfires that are badly affecting the forest ecosystem throughout the globe. This novel approach is a first step toward a predisaster assessment and possibilities to save the survivors in minimal time. Different metaheuristic algorithms, such as PSO, GWO, WOA, BMO, and DGBCO, are compared for UAV path optimization capability. In order to test the robustness of our proposed model, four different scenarios are presented which include general environment, condense environment, maze environment, and dynamic environment. In each scenario, the obstacles are placed in such a way to increase the overall path complexity for a UAV to reach the destination. The exploration and exploitation groups working simultaneously in a dynamic environment make it effective for UAV path planning using the DGBCO algorithm. Based on the parameters selected, the DGBCO algorithm outperforms other algorithms and achieves 24.5% less transportation cost and 13.3% less computational time. Hence, DGBCO can be efficiently applied for UAV path-planning optimization in any of the aforementioned environments.

AB The autonomy of robotic underwater vehicles is dependent on the ability to perform long-term and long-range missions without need of human intervention. While current state-of-the-art underwater navigation techniques are able to provide sufficient levels of precision in positioning, they require the use of support vessels or acoustic beacons. This can pose limitations on the size of the survey area, but also on the whole cost of the operations.
   Terrain Based Navigation is a sensor-based navigation technique that bounds the error growth of dead reckoning using a map with terrain information, provided that there is enough terrain variability. An obvious advantage of Terrain Based Navigation is the fact that no external aiding signals or devices are required. Because of this unique feature, terrain navigation has the potential to dramatically improve the autonomy of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs).
   This paper consists on a comprehensive survey on the recent developments for Terrain Based Navigation methods proposed for AUVs. The survey includes a brief introduction to the original Terrain Based Navigation formulations, as well as a description of the algorithms, and a list of the different implementation alternatives found in the literature. Additionally, and due to the relevance, Bathymetric SLAM techniques will also be discussed.

AB This article presents a strategy for identifying the source location of a chemical plume in near-shore oceanic environments where the plume is developed under the influence of turbulence, tides and waves. This strategy includes two modules: source declaration (or identification) and source verification embedded in a subsumption architecture. Algorithms for source identification are derived from the moth-inspired plume tracing strategies based on a chemical sensor. The in-water test missions, conducted in November 2002 at San Clemente Island (California, USA) in June 2003 in Duck (North Carolina, USA) and in October 2010 at Dalian Bay (China), successfully identified the source locations after autonomous underwater vehicles tracked the rhodamine dye plumes with a significant meander over 100 meters. The objective of the verification module is to verify the declared plume source using a visual sensor. Because images taken in near shore oceanic environments are very vague and colors in the images are not well-defined, we adopt a fuzzy color extractor to segment the color components and recognize the chemical plume and its source by measuring color similarity. The source verification module is tested by images taken during the CPT missions.

ID MODEL; FLOW
AB Automatic lane change is one of the most important highway operations. It seriously affects traffic efficiency and safety. It is also an important driving technology for automatic driving. To achieve the best automatic lane-change control, it is necessary to achieve the control from the perspective of multi-objective evaluation. In this paper, to make it applicable for a hybrid condition of car following and lane change, the traditional car-following model is modified by regarding the longitudinal motion during the lane-changing process as a transition of the car-following behavior in the two lanes before and after a certain lane-change behavior. A hyperbolic tangent transition function is introduced to connect the model to achieve a smooth transition of the model output. Then, the discretionary lane-change decision process of highway autonomous vehicles is modeled into a two-vehicle game model, and a comprehensive loss function concerning safety, efficiency, and ride comfort is proposed for the evaluation of the strategies. The optimal strategy is obtained by minimizing the expectation of losses. Finally, to verify the performance of the proposed new model, simulations of different car-following and lane-changing models are carried out, which is for multi-target simulation conditions. The results of the simulation show that the new model exhibits higher traffic efficiency, better homogeneity, and stability.

AB The study of dynamics, as well as the design of autonomous planetary rovers, is an urgent and important task. Recently, in the context of the development of robotic systems and mobile vehicles, the relevance of such systems has increased. Various rover designs are proposed and studied: wheeled, walking, jumping, etc., depending on the objectives of the study, the environment, the surface of the planet, etc. Reliability of such autonomous vehicles is the key element for the safety of planetary missions.
   This work is devoted to the study of the dynamics of a mechanical system called the Chaplygin sleigh, which is of independent interest, since it has a relatively simple mathematical model. At the same time, the proposed model is in some ways a simplification of a wide class of vehicles. The paper proposes a study of the influence of the Coulomb friction forces on the dynamics of such a system. A simple mathematical model makes it possible to qualitatively study the motion of such systems on surfaces under the condition of sliding of contact points. The results of the work can be useful for understanding the dynamics, as well as for the design of planetary rovers with a similar design, as well as for the design of planetary rovers moving on the surfaces of ice planets.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) play an important role in the ocean observation and marine scientific research. The utilization of marine environmental energy is a desirable way to enhance the sailing range and endurance of AUVs. In this paper, a detailed model with four sub-models is established to describe the ocean thermal energy utilization process in AUVs, where the factors of system pressure, material's thermal-pressure-physical properties and grid nodes are considered. Based on the model, performance of the utilization system under constant and variable temperature boundaries is analyzed. At last, an AUV driven by ocean thermal energy is deployed in South China Sea to test the utilization performance, and the model is validated by the practical trail data. It is proved that thermal-driven AUV saves about 50% energy of buoyancy-driven process in sea trail. The simulation results are in good agreement with the trial data and prove the correctness and effectiveness of the model. The utilization system shows a better performance in the temperature condition with a higher surface temperature and a greater gradient of thermocline. When reaching the designed depth, AUVs can obtain plenty of time for phase change. The conclusions drawn in the paper provide some guidance for development of the thermal-driven AUV.

ID EXTREMUM-SEEKING
AB The simplest strategy for extremum seeking-based source localization, for sources with unknown spatial distributions and nonholonomic unicycle vehicles without position measurement, employs a constant positive forward speed. Steering of the vehicle in the plane is performed using only the variation of the angular velocity. While keeping the forward speed constant is a reasonable strategy motivated by implementation with aerial vehicles, it leads to complexities in the asymptotic behavior of the vehicle, since the vehicle cannot settle-at best it can converge to a small-size attractor around the source. In this paper we regulate the forward velocity, with the intent of bringing the vehicle to a stop, or as close to a stop as possible. The vehicle speed is controlled using simple derivative-like feedback of the sensor measurement (the derivative is approximated with a washout filter) to which a speed bias parameter V-c is added. The angular velocity is tuned using standard extremum seeking. We prove two results. For V-c in a certain range around zero, we show that the vehicle converges to a ring around the source and on average the limit of the vehicle's heading is either directly away or towards the source. For other values of V-c > 0, the vehicle converges to a ring around the Source and it revolves around the source. Interestingly, the average heading of this revolution around the source is more outward than inward-this is possible because the vehicle's speed is not constant, it is lower during the outward steering intervals and higher during the inward steering intervals. The theoretical results are illustrated with Simulations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Traditional open-pit mineral transportation systems are typically subject to manual command, frequently leading to vehicular delays and traffic congestion. With the advancement of automation and electrification technologies, this study proposes a highly accurate scheduling method for multiple autonomous trucks in an open-pit mine. This model considers micro-level temporal and spatial factors to tackle the task of scheduling autonomous trucks within open-pit mines. The cost function of the concerned scheduling problem is a comprehensive evaluation of energy consumption, time, and output. Beyond the loading and unloading activities, the model also factors in the charging requirements of autonomous trucks in mining regions. The scheduling model integrates a Voronoi diagram search and optimal spatial path time matching, aiming to provide superior mission planning and decision-making solutions for autonomous trucks in mining regions. For an efficient solution to the scheduling problem, we propose an improved-evolution artificial bee colony (IE-ABC) algorithm. This algorithm improves the global search and re-initialization processes and conducts algorithm ablation experiments to closely examine their impact on optimization. Simulation results across various algorithms, cost function definition strategy, and encoding strategy show that our method can improve scheduling performance in energy consumption and time. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model and algorithm can effectively solve the scheduling decision-making problem in an unmanned open-pit mine.

AB Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are a special kind of wireless communication network that facilitates vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. This technology exhibits the potential to enhance the safety of roads, efficiency of traffic, and comfort of passengers. However, this can lead to potential safety hazards and security risks, especially in autonomous vehicles that rely heavily on communication with other vehicles and infrastructure. Trust, the precision of data, and the reliability of data transmitted through the communication channel are the major problems in VANET. Cryptography-based solutions have been successful in ensuring the security of data transmission. However, there is still a need for further research to address the issue of fraudulent messages being sent from a legitimate sender. As a result, in this study, we have proposed a methodology for computing vehicle's reputation and subsequently predicting the trustworthiness of vehicles in networks. The blockchain records the most recent assessment of the vehicle's credibility. This will allow for greater transparency and trust in the vehicle's history, as well as reduce the risk of fraud or tampering with the information. The trustworthiness of a vehicle is confirmed not just by the credibility, but also by its network behavior as observed during data transfer. To classify the trust, an ensemble learning model is used. In depth tests are run on the data set to assess the effectiveness of the proposed ensemble learning with feature selection technique. The findings show that the proposed ensemble learning technique achieves a 99.98% accuracy rate, which is notably superior to the accuracy rates of the baseline models.

AB This paper investigates the cruise control problem of unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) platoons from the implementation perspective. Unlike most existing works related to platoon cruise control which rely on positioning infrastructures such as lane markings, roadside units, and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), this paper explores a new problem: platoon cruise control in environments without positioning infrastructures. The introduction of this constraint disables most existing cruise control approaches. To address this problem, an integrated localization and planning framework is proposed, which is composed of three modular algorithms. Firstly, to localize multiple vehicles in a common coordinate system, a collaborative localization algorithm is developed through matching local perceptions of different vehicles. Secondly, to maintain the desired platoon configuration, the historical trajectory of the preceding vehicle is reconstructed, based on which the target state is planned for the following vehicle. Finally, a virtual controller based algorithm is designed to generate feasible trajectories for the following vehicle in real time. The proposed framework has two salient features. Firstly, it does not depend on positioning infrastructures and does not introduce additional positioning sensors, such as GNSS/INS modules, ultra-wideband (UWB) devices, magnetic meters and so on, as long as each vehicle is equipped with a perception sensor (Lidar, radar or camera), which however is essential equipment for nowaday autonomous systems. Secondly, the proposed framework does not depend on direct observations between vehicles to achieve relative localization, making it applicable in non-line-of-sight (non-LOS) situations. Real-world experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness, robustness and practicality of the proposed framework.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) object detection is of great significance for avoiding collisions between vehicles and obstacles in autonomous driving. In particular, the recent 3D object detection methods based on supervised learning are widely studied to achieve excellent performance. However, the 3D labels for training in such methods are expensive and often difficult to be collected. To solve this issue, we propose a monocular 3D vehicle detection method. First, we propose a general mathematical K-means-like method for clustering arbitrary object contours into linear equations. Second, the position, orientation and dimensions of the vehicle can be estimated by applying K-means-like method without the need for 3D labels in the contour of the vehicle. Finally, given the 2D object detection, we maximize a posterior probability of vehicle position, orientation and dimensions to improve the accuracy of the 3D object detection based on the results of K-means-like method. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on the dataset collected by the vehicle-side and road-side cameras in the cooperative vehicle infrastructure system (CVIS). Compared with the state-of-art Deep3DBox and SMOKE methods, the evaluated results show that the detection accuracy of 3D object of our method is 1.4% higher than that of Deep3DBox in the vehicle-side system, while for the road-side camera, the proposed method has 3.86% and 4.37% higher accuracy than Deep3DBox and SMOKE, respectively. Thus, the proposed method can be seen as an effective 3D object detection method in the intelligent transportation system and CVIS.

TI Bayesian estimation of follower and leader vehicle poses with a virtual
   trailer link model
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE vehicle following; target tracking; virtual trailer
AB Autonomous Vehicle Following can be achieved if the poses of both the follower and leader vehicles are continuously estimated. This can be achieved by using a Bayesian estimation technique together with a virtual trailer link model. The advantage of such a model is that the follower vehicle will trail a virtual trailer modeled as an attachment to the leader vehicle, instead of the leader vehicle itself so that a safe spacing between the two vehicles is guaranteed. The key to a tractable solution to this vehicle following problem is the justifiable assumption that the pose of the follower vehicle is statistically independent of that of the leader. This assumption is valid when conditioned on the history of the follower vehicle's inputs and the sensor observations made by the follower vehicle. Hence, a factored solution to the joint estimate of the follower and leader poses can be formulated. Due to the factored solution, the pose of the follower vehicle is estimated separately using a recursive estimator In a separate estimator, the poses of the virtual tailer and the leader vehicle are augmented in the tracking process of the leader vehicle. The aim is to command the follower vehicle to trail the estimated pose of the virtual trailer link model. The pose of the virtual trailer is computed with an on-board sensor mounted on the follower vehicle. A case study on the implementation of the proposed formulation, using an Extended Kalman Filter as the main estimator is presented. First, simulation results are presented. To make the simulation results comparable to the actual system, the variances of sensor measurements are set according to real sensor data-sheet values. Various types of vehicle maneuver, such as straight paths and clothoids with left and right transition paths, are considered. Real experiments are also carried out in a car park. A comparison of the estimated paths and the best available ground truth is presented. The path deviations of the proposed system are also compared with similar systems in the literature.

AB Aiming at the problem of autonomous decision making and trajectory planning (ADMTP) for launch vehicles under power failure conditions, the target degradation order strategy (TDOS) and the trajectory online planning method were studied in this paper. Firstly, the influence of power failure on the orbit-injection process was analyzed. Secondly, the TDOS was proposed according to the mission attribute, failure mode, and multi-payload combination. Then, an online planning method based on the adaptive target update iterative guidance method (ATU-IGM) and radial basis neural network (RBFNN) was proposed, where the ATU-IGM adopted the basic TDOS criterion for generating optimal orbit-injection samples and online guidance instructions, and the RBFNN was used for orbit-injection samples training and online generation of orbital missions. Finally, the comparative simulation analysis was performed under multi-failure conditions. The results showed that the TDOS proposed in this paper could meet the requirements of the mission decision making under different failures, target orbit types, orbit-injection methods, and payload compositions. The online trajectory-planning capability deviation was less than 5%, and the mission decision-making and trajectory-planning time were less than 10 ms. This study provides theoretical support for autonomous decision making and planning of space launch missions.

AB Docking of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) involves intricate maneuvering at low speeds under the influence of unknown environmental forces, and is often a challenging operation even for experienced helmsmen. In this paper, we propose an optimization-based trajectory planner for performing automatic docking of a small ASV. The approach formulates the docking objective as a nonlinear optimal control problem, which is used to plan collision-free trajectories. Compared to recent works, the main contributions are the inclusion of a map of the harbor and additional measurements from range sensors, such as LIDAR and ultrasonic distance sensors, to account for map inaccuracies as well as unmapped objects, such as moored vessels. To use the map and sensor data, a set generation method is developed, which in real-time computes a safe operating region, this is then used to ensure the planned trajectory is safe. To track the planned trajectory, a trajectory-tracking dynamic positioning controller is used. The performance of the method is tested experimentally on a small ASV in confined waters in Trondheim, Norway. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is able to perform collision-free docking maneuvers with respect to static obstacles, and achieves successful docking.

AB This study explores the infrastructure investments needed to support the adoption of autonomous vehicles and provides potential safety benefits from AV technologies as a possible motivation for such investments. We assume that the motor carrier industry will be (one of) the first adopter(s) of such technologies, and therefore is the focus of this study. Using large truck crash data from 2013 through 2015 obtained from the Missouri State Highway Patrol, Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detection decision trees are estimated to examine the effect of AV technologies on motor carrier crash severity. Results suggest that the greatest contributory predictors of crash severity outcomes are driving too fast for conditions, distracted/inattentive driving, overcorrecting and driving under the influence of alcohol. If these circumstances are altered by AV technologies, it is suggested that between 117 and 193 severe crashes involving large trucks could be prevented annually in Missouri alone. To render such safety benefits, key vehicle needs include autonomously controlling acceleration and steering, monitoring of the environment, and responding to dynamic driving environments without the need for human intervention. Importantly, the safe operations of a system that can perform such AV tasks require readable lane markings to capitalize on potential safety benefits.

AB Recently, the need for research on tracking driver gazes is increasing owing to the development of driver convenience systems, such as autonomous driving or intelligent driver monitoring system, to address traffic accidents caused by negligence. A camera is installed in a vehicle to track the driver's gaze in vehicle environment. The accuracy of estimating driver gazes in vehicle environments reduces if a motion blur of the driver occurs, owing to vehicular vibrations during driving. Most past studies on gaze-tracking of a driver in a vehicle did not consider the motion blurs in their experiments. To address this concern, we propose a method for improving the accuracy of gaze estimation by deblurring the blurred images of a driver from the vehicle. This study is the first attempt to calculate a driver's gaze by deblurring a motion blurred image with CycleGAN, whereas simultaneously using the image information from the two cameras in the vehicle. In previous studies, multiple deep CNNs were used for obtaining the images of a driver's eyes and face. In this study, information obtained from the two cameras in the vehicle are integrated into an image with three channels and thereafter deblurred, consequently reducing the time required for training. Whereas in previous studies the gaze position was not calculated for severe blurs by measuring the level of blur from the input image, the gaze position was calculated for all the input images in this study. From the database (Dongguk blurred gaze database (DBGD)) from 26 drivers in actual vehicles and the Columbia gaze dataset (CAVE-DB) that is an open database, the proposed method exhibited greater accuracy than the existing methods.

ID IMPACT; SYSTEMS; DESIGN
AB Millimeter wave (mmWave) vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications has received significant attention as one of the key applications in 5G technology, which is called as Giga-V2V (GiV2V). The ultra-wide band of the GiV2V allows vehicles to transfer gigabit data within a few seconds, which can achieve platooning of autonomous vehicles. The platooning process requires the rich data of a 4K dash-camera and LiDAR sensors for accurate vehicle control. To achieve this, 3GPP, a global organization of standards that provides specifications for the 5G mobile technology, is developing a new standard for GiV2V technology by extending the existing specification for device-to-device (D2D) communication. Meanwhile, in the last decade, the mmWave spectrum has been used in the wireless local area network (WLAN) for indoor devices, such as home appliances, based on the IEEE 802.11ad (also known as Wireless Gigabit Alliance (WiGig)) technology, which supports gigabit wireless connectivity of approximately 10 m distance in the 60-GHz frequency spectrum. The WiGig technology has been commercialized and used for various applications ranging from Internet access points to set-top boxes for televisions. In this study, we investigated the applicability of the WiGig technology to the GiV2V communications through experiments on a real vehicular testbed. To achieve this, we built a testbed using commercial off-the-shelf WiGig devices and performed experiments to measure inter-vehicle connectivity on a campus and on city roads with different permitted vehicle speeds. The experimental results demonstrate that disconnections occurred frequently due to the short radio range and the connectivity varied with the vehicle speed. However, the instantaneous throughput was sufficient to exchange large data between moving vehicles in different road environments.

AB Connected vehicle (CV) technologies enable safe and interoperable wireless communication among vehicles and the infrastructure with the possibility to run many applications that can improve safety, and enhance mobility. This paper develops CV-based algorithms which use transit vehicle speed and the estimated time that the vehicle needs to arrive at an intersection to trigger transit signal priority (TSP) initiation. This information is updated each second based on the traffic conditions such as speed, a current distance of a transit vehicle to the intersection, and queue conditions. The algorithm uses the actual speed of a transit vehicle and its latitude/longitude (lat/lon) coordinates to compute the time that the vehicle needs to reach the stop line. It was tested on a real-world network using VISSIM traffic simulation, but can easily be implemented in the field, since it is using world coordinates. The upgraded algorithm was applied to a future bus rapid transit (BRT) scenario, and included different levels of conditional TSP, which depend on three combined conditions: the time that a transit vehicle needs to reach the stop line, the number of passengers on board, and the lateness that the transit vehicle experiences. The test-case network used for model building is a corridor consisting of ten signalized intersections along State Street in Salt Lake City, UT. The CV algorithms coupled with TSP can yield notable delay reductions for both the regular bus and the BRT of 33% and 12%, respectively.

AB This paper focuses on the lane-changing trajectory planning (LTP) process in the automatic driving technologies. Existing studies on the LTP algorithms are primarily the static planning method in which the states of the surrounding vehicles of a lane-changing vehicle are assumed to keep unchanged in the whole lane-changing process. However, in real-world traffic, the velocities of the surrounding vehicles change dynamically, and the lane-changing vehicle needs to adjust its velocity and positions correspondingly in real-time to maintain safety. To address such limitations, the dynamic lane-changing trajectory planning (DLTP) model is proposed in the limited literature. This paper proposes a novel DLTP model consisting of the lane-changing starting-point determination module, trajectory decision module and trajectory generation module. The model adopts a time-independent polynomial trajectory curve to avoid the unrealistic assumptions on lane-changing velocities and accelerations in the existing DLTP model. Moreover, a rollover avoidance algorithm and a collision-avoidance algorithm containing a reaction time are presented to guarantee the lane-changing safety of automated vehicles, even in an emergent braking situation. The field lane-changing data from NGSIM data are used to construct a real traffic environment for lane-changing vehicles and verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, and CarSim is applied to investigate the traceability of the planned lane-changing trajectories using the proposed model. The results indicate that an automated vehicle can complete the lane changing process smoothly, efficiently and safely following the trajectory planned by the proposed model, and the planned velocity and trajectory can be well-tracked by automated vehicles.

AB Route planning in agricultural fields is a major challenge closely related to the amount of inputs consumed and the associated soil compaction. Current approaches primarily focus on reducing the travelled distances (i.e., the trajectories that vehicles have to cover to carry out the task) and generally do not consider other optimization criteria such as input costs (e.g., fuel, herbicides, labor). Furthermore, although few approaches consider more than one vehicle, none of them takes into consideration vehicles with different characteristics, such as different speeds or different turning radii, and some variabilities of the field such as the weed distribution have not been studied yet. All these factors affect the cost of routes to be followed to accomplish agricultural tasks such as site-specific treatments. In this context, this study proposes a very general approach to optimize the routes that considers: (1) different criteria such as the travelled distance, the time required to perform the task and the input costs, even simultaneously, (2) vehicles with different features (e.g., working speeds, both intra and inter-crop, turning radii, fuel consumptions, tank capacities and spraying costs), (3) the variability of the field and (4) the possibility of tank refilling.
   The proposed approach has special relevance for route planning in site-specific herbicide applications. This case requires a tank on board the vehicle to store an agrochemical product, and its capacity must be considered because it affects the routes to be followed, specifically in those cases in which the tank capacity may not be sufficient to treat the entire field even when working in cooperation with other vehicles. In such cases, refilling (i.e., a round trip to the refilling depot) may be essential despite the extra cost involved in this operation.
   The proposed approach was validated by solving several illustrative problems. The results showed that the proposed route planner covers a broad range of agricultural situations and that the optimal routes may vary considerably depending on the features of the fleet vehicles, the variability of the field and the optimization criteria selected. Finally, a comparative study against other well-known agricultural planners was carried out, yielding routes that improved those produced by the reference approaches. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Worldwide efforts have been made to deploy connected vehicle (CV) technologies in practice. The Korean government has also conducted various projects to fully exploit the benefits of CVs. This study attempted to estimate the safety benefits achievable of CVs based on crash risk analyses, which is a part of a pre-deployment project for CVs on freeways. A nice feature of the CVs in this project is that they are equipped with in-vehicle forward collision warning systems that are capable of providing both the speed of a preceding vehicle and the spacing between the preceding vehicle and a subject vehicle. This technical support enables us to systematically analyze vehicle interactions in terms of traffic safety. The crash potential index (CPI), which is able to analyze vehicle interactions in terms of crash risks, was adopted to quantify the crash potential of CVs when the forward hazardous situation warning (FHSW) information was either provided or not provided. The results of this study show that the average speed decreased by 10.2 % and the time-to-collision (TTC) increased by 5.3 % when warning information was provided. In addition, the achievable reduction in the CPI was approximately 20.7 % due to the provision of warning information. An illustrative demonstration of identifying freeway hazardous spots was also presented as a further application of the CPI analysis. The outcomes of this study will be useful for the establishment of relevant policies to promote CV technologies.

AB A vast number of pollutants are generated from on-road commuting vehicles, and there is an increasing need to explore vehicle emission monitoring and mitigation strategies. Traditionally, vehicle emissions can be monitored and measured directly from on-vehicle devices such as a sensor at the tailpipe, or based on expensive data collection tools such as roadside units; while another mainstream research estimates vehicle emissions by relying on the connection to the vehicle motions, which can approximately calculate vehicle emissions under certain traffic conditions. This paper proposes a virtual reality (VR) enabled digital twin platform for on-road emission monitoring, and it develops and evaluates eco-driving strategies within a specific area. The proposed approach, integrating a VR-based digital environment, a micro-simulation model for background traffic, and a Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator for emission estimation, offers an alternative to collect and examine vehicle emissions such as NOx under various traffic conditions. A case study on a central business area in Melbourne is conducted and eco-driving strategies are tested in two scenarios. The first scenario concerns the impact of hybrid electric vehicles and connected autonomous vehicles, which points to the long-term benefit of having controllable and cleaner modes of transportation as a strategy. Results showed that manipulating the penetration rate of emission-friendly engines or motions could reduce vehicle emissions effectively. The second scenario concerns the real-time eco-routing based on emission-optimum, which points to the short-term benefit of emission control strategies. Human-in-the-loop experiments were conducted to test drivers' responses toward routing options. Results showed that over 90% of participants would follow the eco-routing recommendations completely. The presented study offers an alternative to data-generating, analyzing, and managing approaches for on-road emissions in urban transportation systems.

AB The departments of transportation worldwide are facing various challenges despite introducing and incorporating various vehicular features. One of such challenges is to make vehicles autonomous, intelligent, and capable of self-learning to evolve their knowledge repository. In this paper, human cognition is proposed to be implemented in vehicles so that they can perform human-like decisions. Therefore, the process of vehicular route decision is debated cognitively in order to provide route information intelligently. The in-vehicle routes provided by the GPS are not optimal and lack on-demand user requirements. GPS connectivity issues, in certain conditions, make it difficult for vehicles to take real-time decisions. This leads to the idea of self-decision by the vehicle controller. We propose a cognitive framework for vehicles to make self-decisions that use cognitive memory for storing route experiences. The framework strengthens the existing in-vehicle route finding capability and its provision in a more realistic manner. The user is provided with all available route-related information that is required for the journey. In addition, the route episodes are learned, stored, and accessed inside the cognitive memory for an optimal route provision. The vehicle learns about the routes and matures with route-experience by itself with the passage of time. In simulations, fuzzy modeling is used to validate the impact of cognitive parameters over static/conventional parameters. Moreover, artificial neural networks are used to minimize the error rate in learning to achieve cognitive route decisions. The proposed in-vehicle cognitive framework outperforms the existing route provision system that is inadequate and provokes the user's anxieties during driving. Besides, the proposed scheme gradually gets mature in delivering optimal as well as latest route-related information.

AB Oversaturation has become a serious issue for urban intersections worldwide due to the rapid increase in population and traffic demands. The emergence of connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies demonstrates the potential to improve oversaturated arterial traffic. Integrating vehicular control and intersection controller optimization into a single process based on CAV technologies can optimize the performance of mixed traffic flow scenarios with various levels of CAV market penetration. This paper proposes an efficient reservation-based cooperative ecodriving model (RCEM) for an isolated intersection under partial and complete CAV market penetration, which can simultaneously optimize the CAV trajectories and intersection controller. CAVs are utilized to precluster manual vehicles into a platoon to improve vehicle passage efficiency. Then, a heuristic-based algorithm is developed to effectively obtain an optimal solution. The proposed RCEM scheme is compared with fixed signal control and actuated signal control in a Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO)-based platform. Experimental results prove that the RCEM scheme outperforms the fixed signal control and actuated signal control in terms of stop delay, fuel consumption, and emissions under the condition of low levels of CAV penetration. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the system performance further improves as the CAV penetration rate increases, and the stop delay is almost eliminated when the CAV market penetration reaches 100%. Furthermore, the vehicle delay fluctuation under left-turning rates ranging from 5%-75% is 4.4 sec, which is far better than the vehicle delay fluctuation of the fixed signal control (176 sec) and actuated control (65.6 sec).

AB Objective: Several parking assistance systems are available to help drivers back up. Rear cross-traffic alert warns drivers when they are reversing and cross-traffic approaches the rear of their vehicle, as might happen when backing out of a perpendicular parking space in a lot. The goal of this study was to examine the effect of rear cross-traffic alert on backing crashes.
   Methods: Negative binomial regression was used to compare police-reported backing crash rates in 25 U.S. states per insured vehicle year between General Motors and Mazda vehicles with rear cross-traffic alert and the same vehicle models without the optional system, controlling for the presence of other parking assistance systems and additional factors that may affect crash risk.
   Results: Crash involvement rates in backing crashes overall were 22% lower among vehicles with rear cross traffic alert than among vehicles without the system when averaged between the two manufacturers. Rates were 32% lower among vehicles with the system than without in two-vehicle backing crashes where the vehicles were traveling in perpendicular directions. Both reductions were statistically significant.
   Conclusions: Rearview cameras and rear automatic braking, which are designed to help drivers detect and brake for obstacles directly behind the vehicle, have been shown in previous research to be effective in reducing backing crashes reported to the police. Rear cross-traffic alert can complement these systems by preventing potential backing crashes that other parking assistance systems are not designed to detect. Manufacturers should equip vehicles with rear cross-traffic alert, in addition to other parking assistance systems like rear automatic braking, to maximize the number of backing crashes prevented.

AB Automated driving is gaining increasing amounts of attention from both industry and academic communities because it is regarded as the most promising technology for improving road safety in the future. The ability to make an automated lane change is one of the most important parts of automated driving. However, there has been little research into automated lane change maneuvers, and current research has not identified a way to avoid potential collisions during lane changes, which result from the state variations of the other vehicles. One important reason is that the lane change vehicle cannot acquire accurate information regarding the other vehicles, especially the vehicles in the adjacent lane. However, vehicle-to-vehicle communication has the advantage of providing more information, and this information is more accurate than that obtained from other sensors, such as radars and lasers. Therefore, we propose a dynamic automated lane change maneuver based on vehicle-to-vehicle communication to accomplish an automated lane change and eliminate potential collisions during the lane change process. The key technologies for this maneuver are trajectory planning and trajectory tracking. Trajectory planning calculates a reference trajectory satisfying the demands of safety, comfort and traffic efficiency and updates it to avoid potential collisions until the lane change is complete. The trajectory planning method converts the planning problem into a constrained optimization problem using the lane change time and distance. This method is capable of planning a reference trajectory for a normal lane change, an emergency lane change and a change back to the original lane. A trajectory-tracking controller based on sliding mode control calculates the control inputs to make the host vehicle travel along the reference trajectory. Finally, simulations and experiments using a driving simulator are conducted. They demonstrate that the proposed dynamic automated lane change maneuver can avoid potential collisions during the lane change process effectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The development of autonomous mobile machines to perform useful tasks in real work environments is currently being impeded by concerns over effectiveness, commercial viability and, above all, safety. This paper introduces a case study of a robotic excavator to explore a series of issues around system development, navigation in unstructured environments, autonomous decision making and changing the behaviour of autonomous machines to suit the prevailing demands of users. The adoption of the Real-Time Control Systems (RCS) architecture (Albus, 1991) is proposed as a universal framework for the development of intelligent systems. In addition it is explained how the use of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) (Kaelbling et al., 1998) can form the basis of decision making in the face of uncertainty and how the technique can be effectively incorporated into the RCS architecture. Particular emphasis is placed on ensuring that the resulting behaviour is both task effective and adequately safe, and it is recognised that these two objectives may be in opposition and that the desired relative balance between them may change. The concept of an autonomous system having "values" is introduced through the use of utility theory. Limited simulation results of experiments are reported which demonstrate that these techniques can create intelligent systems capable of modifying their behaviour to exhibit either 'safety conscious' or 'task achieving' personalities.

AB In an urban and uncontrolled environment, the presence of mixed traffic of autonomous vehicles, classical vehicles, vulnerable road users, e.g., pedestrians, and unprecedented dynamic events makes it challenging for the classical autonomous vehicle to navigate the traffic safely. Therefore, the realization of collaborative autonomous driving has the potential to improve road safety and traffic efficiency. However, an obvious challenge in this regard is how to define, model, and simulate the environment that captures the dynamics of a complex and urban environment. Therefore, in this research, we first define the dynamics of the envisioned environment, where we capture the dynamics relevant to the complex urban environment, specifically, highlighting the challenges that are unaddressed and are within the scope of collaborative autonomous driving. To this end, we model the dynamic urban environment leveraging a probabilistic graphical model (PGM). To develop the proposed solution, a realistic simulation environment is required. There are a number of simulators-CARLA (Car Learning to Act), one of the prominent ones, provides rich features and environment; however, it still fails on a few fronts, for example, it cannot fully capture the complexity of an urban environment. Moreover, the classical CARLA mainly relies on manual code and multiple conditional statements, and it provides no pre-defined way to do things automatically based on the dynamic simulation environment. Hence, there is an urgent need to extend the off-the-shelf CARLA with more sophisticated settings that can model the required dynamics. In this regard, we comprehensively design, develop, and implement an extension of a classical CARLA referred to as CARLA+ for the complex environment by integrating the PGM framework. It provides a unified framework to automate the behavior of different actors leveraging PGMs. Instead of manually catering to each condition, CARLA+ enables the user to automate the modeling of different dynamics of the environment. Therefore, to validate the proposed CARLA+, experiments with different settings are designed and conducted. The experimental results demonstrate that CARLA+ is flexible enough to allow users to model various scenarios, ranging from simple controlled models to complex models learned directly from real-world data. In the future, we plan to extend CARLA+ by allowing for more configurable parameters and more flexibility on the type of probabilistic networks and models one can choose. The open-source code of CARLA+ is made publicly available for researchers.

AB Within the growing suite of shared mobility options, peer-to-peer (P2P) carsharing provides an opportunity for vehicle owners to rent out their vehicle to other individuals through informal arrangements or more typically through a facilitating company/broker. Despite the potential to offset some of the costs of vehicle ownership and contribute more broadly to the shared economy, barriers remain including that of sharing one's own vehicle with a stranger. Driverless vehicles (DVs) provide potential to partially address this barrier to carsharing, but it is unknown if this will be embraced by vehicle owners per se and to what extent this might be influenced by their personal characteristics and values. Within this context, the current paper evaluates the joint attitudes of 751 Australian vehicle owners towards sharing of their current vehicle and embracing DVs. Overall, while most respondents remain concerned about DV technology, they understand the benefits, expressing higher concerns about carsharing. Segmentation procedures are used to profile participants on key dimensions including their willingness-to-purchase a DV, demographics, personality and psychological constructs and contextual factors. Four classes of vehicle owners are identified with 14% being ambivalent to sharing and DVs, 14% highly concerned, 48% being 'on the fence' and 24% expressing positive sentiments towards these new forms of mobility. Ambivalence appears to be more pronounced with significantly older, male participants who are less agreeable and conscientious, while concern seems to be a trait of older females more adhering to security, tradition, conformity, and benevolence. Conversely, positive sentiments are associated with participants who are slightly older, male, more open-minded, while less benevolent and traditional. Findings highlight the importance of offering tailored packages of information, messages and services that appeal to the personal benefits and cost savings for some segments of the community, but which highlight the altruistic benefit of sharing for others.

AB As companies begin to consider new alternatives to urban transportation and urban air mobility, one method under investigation is autonomous air taxis. Literature indicates that people, in general, have positive attitudes towards innovation and new technology. However, complex factors determine their willingness and speed in acceptance. The objective of this study was to examine which factors significantly forecast consumer willingness to fly in autonomous air taxis. A quantitative methodology and non-experimental design were accomplished using 510 participants to develop the regression equation and assess model fit. Six significant predictors of consumer willingness to fly in autonomous air taxis were found: familiarity, value, fun factor, wariness of new technology, fear and happiness. Three additional analyses were assessed using an independent sample of participants, revealing strong model fit. Few previous studies have provided a quantitative assessment of which factors significantly predict consumer willingness to fly in autonomous air taxis. The study contributes to the body of knowledge by identifying six significant factors which account for over 76% of the variance. These findings may help the industry, manufacturers and regulators identify the types of individuals most willing to try this new form of transportation and provide more information on the type of consumer most likely to buy in to this new form of transportation.

ID V2X COMMUNICATION
AB Autonomous vehicle is being developed for widespread deployment. Its reliability and safety are critically dependent on advanced wireless technologies, e.g., vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. The frontend of a V2X system needs an antenna module that enables the vehicle to reliably connect to all other networks. Designing V2X antenna is challenging due to the complex in-vehicle environment, trend for hidden antenna solution, long simulation time and need for omnidirectional coverage. In this article, we survey these challenges as well as existing V2X antenna solutions. In view of the drawbacks in the existing solutions, we propose an efficient design methodology for V2X antennas to provide the desired coverage. The method utilizes a simple geometrical model of the vehicle that captures the shadowing effects of the vehicle body to obtain candidate antenna locations that offer the best coverage via multi-antenna diversity. Hence, complex full-wave simulation can be avoided. The approach is validated through comprehensive full-wave simulations and pattern measurements on two car models. The results confirm that, at 5.9GHz, line-of-sight shadowing has more dominant effect on the received power than multipath propagation due to the car body. In cases of strong diffraction and surface waves, a simple rule-of-thumb can be devised to improve the accuracy of the method.

AB Accurate physical modeling of vehicle dynamics requires extensive a priori knowledge of the studied vehicle. In contrast, data-driven modeling approaches require only a set of data that are a good account of the vehicle's driving envelope. In this brief, we compare, for the first time, the prediction capabilities of both approaches applied to a large-scale real-world driving data set. The data set contains several cornering maneuvers, acceleration, and deceleration stages and was collected over public roads. Linear and nonlinear physical models were identified through nonlinear optimization of their unknown parameters. Closed-form subspace identification methods were used to initialize the estimate of a linear state-space model, and the initialization was then refined through nonlinear optimization. The optimized models were validated against 59 km of independent driving data. The model fits, in the longitudinal velocity, were 68.9% versus 80.2% for the nonlinear physical model and linear data-driven (second-order) model, respectively, and, in the yaw rate, 43.0% versus 63.5%. These results show that, for this vehicle, a simple linear data-driven model outperformed both linear and nonlinear physical models under real-world driving conditions. This has important implications for control design approaches in autonomous vehicles.

AB The global effort to make automated vehicles a common reality on the roads of the world is intensifying in recent years and the challenges of automated driving are being investigated in ever more detail and variety. Among the foremost promises of using automated vehicles (AVs) in daily commute is their assumed benefit on road safety, which should offer additional safety to the most vulnerable road users (pedestrians, cyclists), as well as other vehicles. In this article we aim to derive a functional relationship (dose-response curve) between the proportion of automated vehicles on the road (penetration rate) and the expected accident numbers/fatalities of interactions with vulnerable road users. Our approach is built upon two fundamental components: Firstly, based on an analysis of current accident causes, we can make a projection of which causes of accidents between cars and vulnerable road users could ideally be mitigated by AVs and which not. Secondly, for the accidents that are not mitigated, we still assume a potential for reduction of accident occurrence and accident severity, based on the assumed reaction time of an automated vehicle, compared to the reaction time of a human driver. Based on statistics, braking distances and reaction times, as well as the power model, we derive an estimate of the potential reductions in accidents and fatalities in the presence of automated vehicles, ultimately expressed as a relationship between the proportion of automated vehicles (penetration rate) and the accident numbers/fa-tality rates of accidents between motorized vehicles and vulnerable road users.

AB The American Automobile Association (AAA) conducted a 1-year pilot study of running a self-driving shuttle bus in the old downtown of Las Vegas between November 1, 2017, and October 31, 2018. Using the 3-year business license data in the City of Las Vegas-1 year before, 1 year during, and 1 year after the operation, this study conducts a generalized linear mixed-effect regression analysis to examine whether, and if so, how much operation of the autonomous shuttle bus affected change in the growth of active businesses during its 1-year operation. After controlling for each Census block group's demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, the results show that Census block groups located close to the autonomous shuttle bus stops resulted in a significant increase in the number of active businesses during its operation. We also found significant positive impacts of employment mix, education level, and residents' accessibility to jobs on the number of active business licenses. These results suggest that, like other fixed-guideway public transit, operation and dissemination of autonomous shuttle bus services can play a positive role in enhancing the level of business activities, particularly in old and declined downtown areas. This study ends with implications of the autonomous shuttle bus in terms of economic development.

AB Semantic segmentation is a critical component in autonomous driving and has to be thoroughly evaluated due to safety concerns. Deep neural network (DNN) based semantic segmentation models are widely used in autonomous driving. However, it is challenging to evaluate DNN-based models due to their black-box-like nature, and it is even more difficult to assess model performance for crucial objects, such as lost cargos and pedestrians, in autonomous driving applications. In this work, we propose VASS, a Visual Analytics approach to diagnosing and improving the accuracy and robustness of Semantic Segmentation models, especially for critical objects moving in various driving scenes. The key component of our approach is a context-aware spatial representation learning that extracts important spatial information of objects, such as position, size, and aspect ratio, with respect to given scene contexts. Based on this spatial representation, we first use it to create visual summarization to analyze models' performance. We then use it to guide the generation of adversarial examples to evaluate models' spatial robustness and obtain actionable insights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VASS via two case studies of lost cargo detection and pedestrian detection in autonomous driving. For both cases, we show quantitative evaluation on the improvement of models' performance with actionable insights obtained from VASS.

DT Review
DE Deep neural networks; Autonomous cars; Validation
AB Background Autonomous cars could make traffic safer, more convenient, efficient and sustainable. They promise the convenience of a personal taxi, without the need for a human driver. Artificial intelligence would operate the vehicle instead. Especially deep neural networks (DNNs) offer a way towards this vision due to their exceptional performance particularly in perception. DNNs excel in identifying objects in sensor data which is essential for autonomous driving. These networks build their decision logic through training instead of explicit programming. A drawback of this technology is that the source code cannot be reviewed to assess the safety of a system. This leads to a situation where currently used methods for regulatory approval do not work to validate a promising new piece of technology. Objective In this paper four approaches are highlighted that might help understanding black box technical systems for autonomous cars by focusing on its behaviour instead. The method of experimental psychology is proposed to model the inner workings of DNNs by observing its behaviour in specific situations. It is argued that penetration testing can be applied to identify weaknesses of the system. Both can be applied to improve autonomous driving systems. The shadowing method reveals behaviour in a naturalistic setting while ensuring safety. It can be seen as a theoretical driving exam. The supervised driving method can be utilised to decide if the technology is safe enough. It has potential to be developed into a practical driving exam.

AB Security has been the most widely researched topic, particularly within IoT, and has been considered as the major hurdle in the adoption of different applications of IoT. When it comes to IoV, security is considered as the most inevitable component to ensure a safe and smooth driving experience. CAV is the new era of transportation, integrating intelligence and self-driving capabilities within vehicles and that requires strong security measures to ensure safety. Security alone is not enough. Instead, a complete package including privacy of the vehicles and passengers needs to be added in addition to secure communication. This is because CAVs are under continuous cyber threats and attacks and the most important among them is the DDoS, where a remote attacker can hijack/launch attacks on vehicles remotely. Single point of failure attacks target the centralized trusted body in order to mislead the connected vehicles for personal gains. In this paper, the authors have proposed a secure communication system for CAVs using blockchain, which also ensures the privacy of the vehicle/people. The paper highlights the major components of the proposed system, and its performance is evaluated to check its efficiency against DDoS and Eclipse attacks. The unlinkability and anonymity of the vehicles have been ensured using the zk-SNAKR protocol over Blockchain.

AB In the foreseeable future, a complex heterogeneous traffic environment will emerge as Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) coexist with Human-driven Vehicles (HDVs). Consequently, understanding the impact of CAVs on car-following behavior and the operational characteristics of heterogeneous traffic flow becomes crucial before their widespread deployment. To tackle this challenge, this research proposes an improved car-following model based on the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM). The model incorporates the position, velocity, and acceleration information of both front and sub-front vehicles in the heterogeneous traffic flow. The impact of different types of information on the model's stability is verified through linear stability analysis while investigating the operational characteristics of traffic flow during vehicle start-up. Additionally, the car-following modes are classified based on the type of leading vehicle, and the corresponding following model is formulated. The results indicate that the improved model significantly im-proves traffic flow stability, particularly when considering acceleration information. Compared to the front vehicle, the influence of the sub-front vehicle on traffic flow stability is less significant, but their combined impact yields positive effects. Furthermore, the improved model reduces the start-up time of vehicles at signalized intersections by 7.9% and enables a smoother start-up process for vehicles. Moreover, CAVs can mitigate the impact of HDV's disturbances on the overall heterogeneous fleet operation by adjusting their spacing relative to the front vehicle. With an increasing penetration rate, the velocity fluctuation of the entire fleet decreases.

AB To deal with the fault of the vehicle platoon, we have established a fault detection and isolation (FDI) system with two-level fault diagnosis architecture. For simplicity, we divide the FDI architecture into two kinds: system failure and component element failure. To detect these faults, we set up the FDI mathematical model of the fleet based on the vehicular spacing, and the sensor FDI model of a certain vehicle. Meanwhile, we construct the state space model of the fleet, and design the residual generator using the space geometry method for system failure. To design the residual generation model of the fleet for component element failure, we strengthen the structure analysis of both the fleet and a certain vehicle. What's more, to elucidate the factors that cause the change of vehicle distance, the virtual force analysis is introduced. Using the adaptive threshold method, it can enhance both the sensitivity of the FDI system to the residual and the robustness to the disturbance. To promote the vehicle itself and the fleet's information perception ability, all vehicles (Autonomous Mobile Robots) are equipped with infrared distance measuring sensors, odometers, a pair of incremental optical encoders, and so on. The experimental results show that the proposed method is reliable and efficient for FDI of fleet.

ID TARGET ASSIGNMENT
AB In this paper, we present adaptive and distributed algorithms for motion coordination of a group of vehicles. The vehicles must service demands whose time of arrival, spatial location, and service requirement are stochastic; the objective is to minimize the average time demands spend in the system. The general problem is known as the m-vehicle Dynamic Traveling Repairman Problem (m-DTRP). The best previously known control algorithms rely on centralized task assignment and are not robust against changes in the environment. In this paper, we first devise new control policies for the 1-DTRP that: i) are provably optimal both in light-load conditions (i.e., when the arrival rate for the demands is small) and in heavy-load conditions (i.e., when the arrival rate for the demands is large), and ii) are adaptive, in particular, they are robust against changes in load conditions. Then, we show that specific partitioning policies, whereby the environment is partitioned among the vehicles and each vehicle follows a certain set of rules within its own region, are optimal in heavy-load conditions. Building upon the previous results, we finally design control policies for the m-DTRP that i) are adaptive and distributed, and ii) have strong performance guarantees in heavy-load conditions and stabilize the system in any load condition.

ID VARIABLE MESSAGE SIGNS
AB Road traffic is drastically increasing in big cities around the world. In order to enable a flexible management of this traffic, Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) solutions are relying on emergent ubiquitous, mobile, and communi-cation technologies, particularly to intelligently deal with the limited capacities of the existing road infrastructures. While intelligence is left to the autonomous and connected vehicles as well as to the ITS, the road infrastructure has been mostly playing a passive role (as a source of data). Road signage, in particular, are in best cases dynamic but do not play an active role in monitoring traffic and incidents. We propose in this paper to build Smart Road Signs (SRS) that can collaborate with Connected Vehicles in order to monitor traffic and warn drivers about any in-cident or danger. Our SRSs are meant to operate autonomously in order to detect road traffic problems, share appropriate information with vehicles in the vicinity, and display relevant messages based on the ongoing contextual situation. To meet our goals, we rely on Multi-Agent Systems to design SRSs as proactive components in the ITS landscape. We also rely on agent mobility in order to strengthen the collaboration with the connected vehicles.

AB This paper presents a search-based global motion planning method, called the two-phase A*, with an adaptive heuristic weight. This method is suitable for planning a global path in real time for a car-like vehicle in both indoor and outdoor environments. In each planning cycle, the method first estimates a proper heuristic weight based on the hardness of the planning query. Then, it finds a nearly optimal path subject to the non-holonomic constraints using an improved A* with a weighted heuristic function. By estimating the heuristic weight dynamically, the two-phase A* is able to adjust the optimality level of its path based on the hardness of the planning query. Therefore, the two-phase A* sacrifices little planning optimality, and its computation time is acceptable in most situations. The two-phase A* has been implemented and tested in the simulations and real-world experiments over various task environments. The results show that the two-phase A* can generate a nearly optimal global path dynamically, which satisfies the non-holonomic constraints of a car-like vehicle and reduces the total navigation time.

AB In the presence of the unmodelled dynamics and external time-varying disturbances, letting an underactuated underwater vehicle track a reference trajectory correctly without knowledge of the vehicle's linear velocity is a challenging problem. This study reports a solution to this problem by proposing a linear velocity observer that is based on available states. Furthermore, a fuzzy observer-based tracking controller is designed, where fuzzy logic systems are resorted to approximate the model uncertainties and disturbances. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the vehicle can converge to a neighbourhood of the reference smooth trajectory, hence achieving a global state that is uniformly and ultimately bounded. In order to validate the performance of the proposed controller, numerical examples are presented. They show that the linear velocity observer can be used to estimate the actual linear velocity and the underwater vehicle is able to track the reference trajectory closely.

AB Due to the lack of natural driving databases containing heterogeneous traffic in the existing heterogeneous car-following modeling research, there is an urgent need for the support of a large amount of measured trajectory data for modeling. To this end, four different car-following modes of heterogeneous traffic under the influence of different vehicle types are extracted from the HighD data set, with which the statistical characteristics of the following car speed, speed difference, gap, time headway and acceleration in each mode are studied separately. Moreover, the correlation analysis of two parameters in speed-gap and speed difference-gap is carried out. On this basis, the intelligent driver model (IDM) and the full velocity difference (FVD) model are, respectively, employed to model the car-following characteristics in each mode. The results show that the existence of the truck in the following vehicle pair makes the following vehicle tend to maintain a larger gap and a smaller following speed, that is, larger time headway and gap. With the increase of trucks' ratio, the capacity of traffic decreases. The research can lay the foundation for more accurate mixed traffic flow modeling of heterogeneous human driving vehicles, and even subsequent research on heterogeneous traffic characteristics under a mixture of human driving vehicles and autonomous vehicles.

AB Real-time vehicle detection is one of the challenging problems for automotive and autonomous driving applications. Object detection using Deformable Parts Model (DPM) proved to be a promising approach providing higher detection accuracy. But the baseline DPM scheme spends 98% of its execution time in loop processing thus highlighting the drawback of higher computational cost for real time applications. In this paper, we have proposed a real time vehicle detection scheme for a low-powered embedded Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). The proposed scheme is based upon DPM approach using CUDA programming with different parallelization and loop unrolling schemes to reduce computational cost of DPM. Three loop unrolling schemes i.e. loosely unrolled, tightly unrolled and hybrid unrolled is proposed and implemented on two different datasets. Finally, we provided an optimal solution for vehicle detection with minimum execution time without having any impact on vehicle detection accuracy. We achieved a speedup of 3x to 5x as compared to state-of-the-art GPU implementation and 30x as compared to baseline CPU implementation of DPM on a low-powered automotive-grade embedded computing platform which features a Tegra K1 System on Chip (SOC), thus getting advantage of improved efficiency through parallel computation of CUDA.

AB Understanding the dynamic characteristics of surrounding vehicles and estimating the potential risk of mixed traffic can help reliable autonomous driving. However, the existing risk assessment methods are challenging to detect dangerous situations in advance and tackle the uncertainty of mixed traffic. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic driving risk assessment framework based on intention identification and risk assessment of surrounding vehicles. Firstly, we set up an intention identification model (IIM) via long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to identify the intention possibility of the surrounding vehicles. Then a risk assessment model (RAM) based on the driving safety field is employed to output the potential risk. Specifically, driving safety field can reflect the coupling relationship of drivers, vehicles, and roads by analyzing their interaction. Finally, an integrated risk evaluation model combining both IIM and RAM is developed to form a dynamic potential risk map considering multi-vehicle interaction. For example, in a typical but challenging lane-changing scenario, an intelligent vehicle can assess its driving status by calculating a risk map in real time that represents the risk generated by the estimated intentions of surrounding vehicles. Furthermore, simulations and naturalistic driving experiments are conducted in the extracted lane-changing scenarios, and the results verify the effectiveness of the proposed model considering lane-changing behavior interaction.

AB Accurate and robust vehicle localization, a fundamental task for autonomous driving, is still a challenging problem especially in GPS-denied scenarios. Recently, high definition (HD) map suggests a promising solution. However, the matching between online sensed data and HD map is difficult and time-consuming. In our work, road markings are selected as landmarks due to salient appearance features. Based on the detection results of road markings from the vehicle-borne images, the points of edge lines are employed to fit straight lines with RANSAC for outlier removal. The distances between the ego-vehicle and the fitted edge lines can be computed with camera-vehicle calibration in advance. Subsequently, the point-to-line distances from the sensed data are mapped into global linear constraints on the vehicle's positions with the support of a lane-level HD map, which provides centimeter-level coordinates of road markings. Finally, the distances and the localization from the integrated navigation system (INS) are fused with the proposed linear Kalman filter based on the second-order Markov model (KF-MM2). The proposed method has been verified in different daily driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve good performance with an average localization error of 0.53 m and a standard deviation of 0.17 m.

AB An Odyssey IIb autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) made by Bluefin Robotics, Inc., was acquired by the Marine Physical Laboratory Scripps Institution of Oceanography, to conduct research in underwater acoustics as well as provide a platform for other scientific studies. The original Odyssey IIb tail cone was replaced with a ducted fan, vectored thrust system installed on vehicles currently sold by Bluefin. In initial sea tests with the new thrust system, the acoustic self noise levels of the vehicle while underway were 20 to 50 dB higher than typical ocean background noise levels, preventing the vehicle's use as a receiver of low level sounds. Controlled tests were performed to characterize the radiated and vibration noise of the AUV propulsion and actuators. Once this baseline was established, changes were made, mostly to the tail cone propulsion, to decrease the vehicle's self noise. The resulting self noise levels of the AUV from 10 Hz up to 10 kHz measured while underway by a hydrophone mounted on the AUV's inner shroud now are at or below typical shallow water background noise levels except in three bands; below 250 Hz, around 500 Hz, and from 0.9 to 2.0 kHz. The goal of this paper is to describe these changes and their effects in lowering vehicle noise levels.

AB Increased E-commerce and demand for contactless delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic have fueled interest in robotic package delivery. We evaluate life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for automated suburban ground delivery systems consisting of a vehicle (last-mile) and a robot (final-50-feet). Small and large cargo vans (125 and 350 cubic feet; V125 and V350) with an internal combustion engine (ICEV) and battery electric (BEV) powertrains were assessed for three delivery scenarios: (i) conventional, human-driven vehicle with human delivery; (ii) partially automated, human-driven vehicle with robot delivery; and (iii) fully automated, connected automated vehicle (CAV) with robot delivery. The robot's contribution to life cycle GHG emissions is small (2-6%). Compared to the conventional scenario, full automation results in similar GHG emissions for the V350-ICEV but 10% higher for the V125-BEV. Conventional delivery with a V125-BEV provides the lowest GHG emissions, 167 g CO(2)e/package, while partially automated delivery with a V350-ICEV generates the most at 486 g CO(2)e/package. Fuel economy and delivery density are key parameters, and electrification of the vehicle and carbon intensity of the electricity have a large impact. CAV power requirements and efficiency benefits largely offset each other, and automation has a moderate impact on life cycle GHG emissions.

AB This paper proposes a multi-control vehicle-to-grid charger with bi-directional power capability. The proposed charger can perform vehicle battery charging and discharging operations, as well as power grid support such as reactive power compensation, power factor correction, and grid voltage regulation. The performances of the charger controls were examined under various power grid scenarios. Results revealed that the vehicle-to-grid charger attained the highest charger efficiency when operating at unity power factor mode. Nevertheless, vehicle charging at unity power factor introduced a significant grid voltage drop which may violate the grid voltage limits. This problem was solved by using the voltage control, which injected reactive power to the power grid for accurate voltage regulation. This paper also proposed an autonomous multi-control selection algorithm to intelligently switch between the multiple charger controls in response to the power grid condition. Results showed that the proposed algorithm effectively instructed the charger to work in efficient control modes if the grid voltage was within the permissible voltage limits. Whenever the grid voltage exceeded the limits, the charger automatically switched to grid voltage control for power grid voltage regulation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Since it will take time for vehicles to be fully automated, research on mixed traffic flow with different levels of vehicles will be the focus in the future. This paper takes L0, L1, L2, L3, L4, L5 vehicles as the research object, selects the Intelligent Diver Model (IDM), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) model, F-STCA model and LC2013 model to construct the vehicle's driving behaviour model, builds SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) and Python co-simulation platform to conduct models simulation verification and safety analysis. The results show that: (1) The improved IDM model can realize the error caused by the heterogeneity of driver's personality; the improved ACC model can improve speed and keep a small change range with the interfering vehicle; the improved F-STCA model can expand the vehicle's lane-changing intention and reflect the driver's driving uncertainty. (2) The increase of penetration can increase the number of lane changes in basic sections, but in merging area, they are proportional at low density and inversely proportional at high density; penetration can reduce the occurrence of traffic conflicts and change the distribution of Time-To -Collision (TTC). This paper can predict the evolution law of traffic flow under the new technology, and provide a reference for future traffic planning and management.

AB Purpose The aim of this paper is threefold: first, to review the technological state of the art on tire sensor systems; second, to summarize basic methodologies and explore the potential of tire sensing for intelligent vehicle developments and third, to address challenges in the development of tire sensing systems and inspire future research in this field.
   Design/methodology/approach Nowadays, automotive industry is moving toward an intelligent and autonomous driving era with the assistance of sensing technology development, whereas tire-road conditions sensing and utilization are of great interest from the point of view of vehicle dynamics control, vehicle safety and vehicle performance evaluation.
   Findings Tire sensing is an emerging technology whereby sensor systems are installed on the tire to provide fundamental insights into tire-road interactions for ground vehicles and wheel robots. In the past two decades, tire sensing systems based on various sensor types have been proposed to offer the possibility to investigate tire-road interactions.
   Originality/value Instrumenting the tire with sensors, especially accelerometers and optical sensors, can sense the tire-road interactions and enhance the vehicle performance. The harsh environment inside tire cavity requires reliable, accurate, low weight, modularized and inexpensive sensors. Challenges, such as the data transmission, power management, lack of physics-based tire models need to be solved before the tire sensor becomes commercially viable for production vehicles.

AB Developments in connected and autonomous vehicle technologies provide drivers with many convenience and safety benefits. Unfortunately, as connectivity and complexity within vehicles increase, more entry points or interfaces that may directly or indirectly access in-vehicle networks (IVNs) have been introduced, causing a massive rise in security risks. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a practical method for controlling malicious attacks while guaranteeing real-time communication. Regarding the ever-evolving security attacks on IVNs, researchers have paid more attention to employing deep learning-based techniques to deal with privacy concerns and security threats in the IDS domain. Therefore, this article comprehensively reviews all existing deep IDS approaches on in-vehicle networks and conducts fine-grained classification based on applied deep network architecture. It investigates how deep-learning techniques are utilized to implement different IDS models for better performance and describe their possible contributions and limitations. Further compares and discusses the studied schemes concerning different facets, including input data strategy, benchmark datasets, classification technique, and evaluation criteria. Furthermore, the usage preferences of deep learning in IDS, the influence of the dataset, and the selection of feature segments are discussed to illuminate the main potential properties for designing. Finally, possible research directions for follow-up studies are provided.

AB This brief addresses the robust lateral control problem for self-driving racecars. It proposes a discrete-time estimation and control solution consisting of a delayed unknown input-state observer (UIO) and a robust tracking controller. Based on a nominal vehicle model, describing its motion with respect to a generic desired trajectory and requiring no information about the surrounding environment, the observer reconstructs the total force disturbance signal, resulting from imperfect knowledge of the time-varying tire-road interface characteristics, presence of other vehicles nearby, wind gusts, and other model uncertainty. Then, the controller actively compensates the estimated force and asymptotically steers the tracking error to zero. The brief also presents a closed-loop stability proof of the method, ensuring perfect asymptotic estimation and tracking by the controlled vehicle. The proposed solution advantageously needs no a-priori information about the total disturbance boundedness, additional variables to model uncertainty, or observer parameters to be tuned. Its effectiveness and superiority to existing methods are studied in theory and shown in simulations where a full racecar model, based on the vehicle dynamics blockset, is required to track aggressive maneuvers. Through a faster and more accurate disturbance estimation, the solution robustly ensures better dynamic responses even with measurement noise.

AB Accurate and reliable vehicle velocity estimation is greatly motivated by the increasing demands of high-precision motion control for autonomous vehicles and the decreasing cost of the required multi-axis IMU sensors. A practical estimation method for the longitudinal and lateral velocities of electric vehicles is proposed. Two reliable driving empirical judgements about the velocities are extracted from the signals of the ordinary onboard vehicle sensors, which correct the integral errors of the corresponding kinematic equations on a long timescale. Meanwhile, the additive biases of the measured accelerations are estimated recursively by comparing the integral of the measured accelerations with the difference of the estimated velocities between the adjacent strong empirical correction instants, which further compensates the kinematic integral error on short timescale. The algorithm is verified by both the CarSim-Simulink co-simulation and the controller-in-the-loop test under the CarMaker-RoadBox environment. The results show that the velocities can be accurately and reliably estimated under a wide range of driving conditions without prior knowledge of the tire-model and other unavailable signals or frequently changeable model parameters. The relative estimation error of the longitudinal velocity and the absolute estimation error of the lateral velocity are kept within 2% and 0.5 km/h, respectively.

AB Fully autonomous or "self-driving" vehicles are an emerging technology that may hold tremendous mobility potential for individuals who are visually impaired who have been previously disadvantaged by an inability to operate conventional motor vehicles. Prior studies however, have suggested that these consumers have significant concerns regarding the accessibility of this technology and their ability to effectively interact with it. We present the results of a quasi-naturalistic study, conducted on public roads with 20 visually impaired users, designed to test a self-driving vehicle human-machine interface. This prototype system, ATLAS, was designed in participatory workshops in collaboration with visually impaired persons with the intent of satisfying the experiential needs of blind and low vision users. Our results show that following interaction with the prototype, participants expressed an increased trust in self-driving vehicle technology, an increased belief in its likely usability, an increased desire to purchase it and a reduced fear of operational failures. These findings suggest that interaction with even a simulated self-driving vehicle may be sufficient to ameliorate feelings of distrust regarding the technology and that existing technologies, properly combined, are promising solutions in addressing the experiential needs of visually impaired persons in similar contexts.

AB The development of science and technology continues to promote the progress of society. The current intelligence and automation technology has become widely used in society. To this end, this study proposes a vehicle intelligent control system based on edge computing and deep learning to promote the far-reaching development of intelligent technology and automation technology. First, control algorithms are used to design a switch control strategy combining accelerator and brake. Second, a fuzzy control algorithm based on vehicle tracking and trajectory deviation is designed to enhance the vehicle's stability during steering. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to recognize the car's surroundings as it drives. In addition, accelerator and brake controllers and vehicle tracking and trajectory deviation controllers are connected to the vehicle's wiring. Then, the data transmission function based on edge computing is applied to the vehicle's intelligent control system. Finally, trajectory tracking and emergency braking experiments are carried out on the control system to verify the practicability and reliability of the method and the effectiveness of CNN. The simulation experiments are carried out on two states of medium speed and high speed to verify the effectiveness of the longitudinal anti-collision system of the test vehicle when the target vehicle suddenly decelerates. The results demonstrate that the driving speed of the experimental vehicle is set to 50km/h, the distance between the experimental vehicle and the target vehicle is 40m, and the target vehicle in front drives at a constant speed of 50km/h. The target vehicle in front of the car suddenly decelerates in 5 seconds, and the speed drops to 0 after 5 seconds. The actual distance between the experimental vehicle and the target vehicle is very close to the expected safe space, and the experimental vehicle is in a safe state during this process. When the experimental vehicle starts to decelerate, the experimental vehicle adopts emergency deceleration to ensure a safe distance between the two vehicles. At this time, the car enters the second-level early warning state, but driving safety can still be guaranteed. It is advisable to maintain low-speed emergency braking in this state. This study provides creative research ideas for the follow-up research on the intelligent control system of uncrewed vehicles and contributes to the development of intelligence and automation technology.

AB Longitudinal dynamics control is the basis for autonomous driving of intelligent vehicles, which have great significance to the development of intelligent transportation system (ITS). To solve the problems of traditional sliding mode control method when applied to intelligent vehicle longitudinal dynamics, such as large velocity tracking errors, strong chattering phenomenon and so on, a new sliding mode control strategy based on RBF (Radical Basis Function) neural network is presented in this paper. Firstly, a nonlinear mathematical model of the intelligent vehicle longitudinal motion is established by considering the dynamics of the engine, the torque converter, the automatic transmission and the brake system. On the basis of the system model, a variable structure control system with sliding mode is introduced to design a sliding mode variable controller with RBF neural network. This controller can adaptively adjust the switching gain and its stability is proved based on the Lyapunov theory. Finally, the effectiveness of the designed longitudinal velocity control strategy is verified by simulation under typical driving conditions. The simulation results show that the improved control algorithm can effectively suppress chattering, obtain the higher precision and stronger robustness than the traditional sliding mode control. Thus, the longitudinal motion control performance of intelligent vehicles is improved effectively.

AB Pick/drop stand road (PDSR) is necessary for specific functions, but it very easily generates congestion and thus results in a less safe and comfortable ride for passengers. The Internet of Vehicles has offered new ideas and technical means to solve the problem. First, this study divides the PDSR into different functional zones and constructs the coordinated control environment of connected vehicles (CVs). A car-following coordinated control strategy (CF-CCS) and a lane-changing coordinated control strategy (LC-CCS) are proposed based on a mixed platoon of CVs and human-driven vehicles. For CF-CCS, this study offers a model for car-following coordinated platoon control based on terminal state prediction of the leading vehicle, with platoon safety and passengers' comfort as optimization objectives, and solves it using a modified particle swarm algorithm. For LC-CCS, a model for lane-changing coordinated control of platoon is proposed, and a numerical approach is utilized to solve it. It is based on finding the best area for lane-changing location while considering the safety of lane changing and the efficiency of vehicle traffic on the PDSR. Last, VISSIM and MATLAB simulations are conducted to prove that the proposed two strategies can effectively ease congestion, significantly increase the speed of traffic flow on PDSR, and provide passengers with safer and more comfortable rides.

AB The need for accurate and reliable navigation techniques for micro air vehicles plays an important part in enabling autonomous operation. Traditional navigation systems typically rely on periodic global positioning system updates and provide little benefit when operating indoors or in other similarly shielded environments. Moreover, direct integration of the onboard inertial measurement unit data stream often results in substantial drift errors yielding virtually unusable positional information. This paper presents a new strategy for obtaining an accurate navigation solution for the special case of a micro hopping air vehicle, beginning from some known location and heading, using only one triaxial accelerometer and one triaxial gyroscope. Utilizing the unique dynamics of the hopping vehicle, a piece-wise navigation solution is constructed by selectively integrating the inertial data stream for only those short periods of time while the vehicle is airborne. Interhop data post processing and sensor bias recalibration are also used to further improve estimation accuracy. To assess the performance of the proposed algorithm, a series of tests were conducted in which the estimated vehicle position following a sequence of 10 consecutive hops was compared with measurements from an optical motion-capture system. On average, the final estimated vehicle position was within 0.70 m or just over 6% from its actual location based on a total traveled distance of approximately 11 m.

AB Due to the mobility of devices, device-to-device (D2D) communication is a promising fifth-generation (5G) technology in dynamic environments for improving message transmission efficiency for group communication. Additionally, all services in an ad hoc network are current Vehicle Ad Hoc Network (VANET) applications. Therefore, D2D communication has been introduced in ad hoc environments to reduce latency during vehicle conversations, such as autonomous vehicle solutions and drone fleet management for cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) modules and Internet of Drones (IoDs) networks. However, providing secure and effective group communication is an urgent challenge. To solve these problems, we propose a dynamic group management solution based on distributed ledger technology. This study demonstrates that a distributed ledger-based hierarchical architecture for dynamic group management is faster and more adaptable without compromising security and performance. Furthermore, the proposed method can facilitate the transfer of direct communication data without a centralized database, thereby reducing the chance of a single point of failure. In addition, the research was tested by a third party that has established close cooperation with world-leading automotive electronics suppliers in Taiwan.

AB For autonomous vehicles and intelligent connected vehicles, the real-time recognition of risky drivers can play an important role in traffic accident prevention. However, the external environment substantially impacts driving behavior and driving risk and is usually costly to acquire. Existing risky driver recognition models often ignore external environment information or assume this information is given. We propose two hierarchical two-layer context-aware machine learning structures. The first layer can speculate external context, for example, traffic states. The second layer recognizes risky drivers based on the contextual information speculated from the first layer. The German Highway Drone Dataset is used to establish risky driver recognition and traffic state recognition models. Rear-end collision risk and side collision risk are evaluated for each vehicle. Drivers with high collision risk are labeled as risky drivers. By analyzing vehicle trajectory data from three traffic states: free-flow, saturated, and congested, we find that traffic states have a significant influence on vehicle's longitudinal speed, lateral speed, longitudinal acceleration/deceleration, and collision risk. Six classifiers, including SVM, KNN, RF, Adaboost, Extra trees, and XGBoost, are applied to train recognition models. Results show that the proposed structures can significantly improve model's ability to recognize risky drivers.

AB Underwater vehicles have carried out subsea operations for many decades, and since the 1980s, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) have been essential for the development and maintenance of subsea installations. As the technology has progressed, various types of vehicles have been developed to perform subsea inspection, maintenance, and repair (IMR) operations, including conventional work class ROVs, inspection class ROVs, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and, more recently, intervention AUVs. The underwater swimming manipulator (USM), presented in this paper, is an innovative bioinspired addition to the family of underwater robotic vehicles. The overall vision of the USM is to provide a significant impact on how to perform inspection and light intervention tasks. In this paper, we discuss the most important applications for the USM and the main challenges related to modeling, guidance, and control of this innovative vehicle. We provide a detailed description of the concept of the USM, together with a proposed generic motion control framework. A kinematic and dynamic model of the USM is derived for the purpose of designing control algorithms, and selected task-based control approaches are presented, based on inverse kinematic control. We also present the development of a simulation environment, a simulation model of the USM, and provide simulations to support the use of USMs for subsea IMR operations.

AB The concept and contents of driving safety field theory were presented in our previous study. On this basis, this study focus on driving safety field theory modeling and application. First, a general model is presented, which considered the driver-vehicle-road interactions. The model include the following three parts: (i) driver behaviors, which are determined by driver characteristics, such as physical-psychological, cognition, driving skill, and traffic violations; (ii) vehicle characteristics, which are determined by velocity vectors and virtual masses of vehicles; (iii) road conditions, which are determined by virtual mass of on road non-moving objects, types of traffic signs, road adhesion coefficient, road slope, road curvature, and visibility. In order to establish concrete functional forms, the specific model is presented. This specific model provides a method for virtual mass calculation and describes the field strength and field force in detail. After that, a driving safety indicator namely DSI is defined. Finally, a vehicle collision warning algorithm based on driving safety field model is presented. This algorithm used a new index namely RDSI to evaluate the driving risk level. The effectiveness of this collision warning algorithm is verified by field experiments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper considers a network in which a set of vehicles is responsible for picking up and delivering messages that arrive according to a Poisson process. Message pickup and delivery locations are uniformly distributed in a convex region. The vehicles are required to pickup and deliver the messages so that the average delay is minimized. It is required that the vehicle that picks up a message must be the one to deliver it. This problem is called the dynamic pickup and delivery problem (DPDP) and has applications in the context of autonomous vehicles and wireless ad hoc networks.
   The control policies considered,are separable into two parts: an assignment policy used by a centralized controller to assign arriving messages to the vehicles for service and a service policy used by each vehicle to determine the service routes through its assigned messages.
   Lower bounds are provided on the delay achievable by separable control policies that depend on the information constraints in place. It is proved that the optimal average delay scaling can be reduced when message destination information is available to the centralized controller in addition to the message source information. The paper also provides policies that achieve these scaling bounds, proving that these bounds are tight.

AB The design of an efficient techno-economic autonomous fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle (FCHEV) is a crucial challenge. This paper investigates the design of a near optimal PI controller for an automated FCHEV, where autonomy is expressed as efficient and robust tracking of a given reference speed trajectory without driver's intervention. An impartial comparison is introduced to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed metaheuristic-based optimal controllers in enhancing the system dynamic performance. The comprehensive optimization performance indicator is considered as a function of the vehicle dynamic characteristics while determining the optimal controller gains. In this paper, the proposed effective up-to-date metaheuristic techniques are the grey wolf optimization (GWO) as well as the artificial bee colony (ABC). Using MATLAB (TM)/Simulink, numerical simulations clearly illustrate the efficiency of near-optimal gains in the optimized tuning methodologies and the fixed manual one in realizing adequate velocity tracking. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of both ABC and GWO rather than the manual controller for driving cycles of high acceleration and deceleration levels. In absence of these latter, the manual defined gain controller is considered sufficient. Through a comprehensive sensitivity analysis, the robustness of both metaheuristic-based controllers is verified under diverse driving cycles of different operation features and nature. Despite GWO results in better dynamic characteristics, the ABC provides more economical feature with about 1.5% compared to manual system in extra urban driving cycle. However, manual-controller has the minimum fuel cost under the United States driving cycle developed by the environmental protection agency as a New York city cycle (US EPA NYCC) and urban driving cycle (ECE). Ecologically, electric vehicles have an environmentally friendly effect especially when driven with green hydrogen. Autonomous vehicles, involving velocity control systems, would raise car share and provide more comfort.

AB Pose estimation with state or measurement constraints has been frequent in autonomous vehicle navigation. Aiming at incorporating constraints inherently, this article proposes a dynamic potential field (DPF)-based formulation to represent states, measurements, and constraints on connected Riemannian manifolds. The state equation and the output equation are derived in the DPF forms, which imply the probabilistic inference with states and measurements. Constraints are incorporated by projecting points toward a constraint subset in the state space and the measurement space, where the DPF representing constraints is created. An information fusion scheme has been designed for DPFs, which are obtained from multisensor measurements and constraints. KITTI and self-collected sequences have been used in experiments, during which it is observed that the rotational drift is corrected and translational errors are reduced, thanks to the fusion of stereo visual odometry (SVO), heading measurements, and road maps. Note to Practitioners-Pose estimation aims to obtain ground vehicle's position and heading in a certain coordinate system. The multisensor fusion has been a popular solution in reducing estimation errors, and constraints are helpful in improving the pose estimation performance by limiting possible solutions. This article proposes a framework to model multisensor pose estimation problems with constraints. The approximated estimation scheme inspired by the Monte Carlo method has been provided such that the framework can be applied to various systems without analytic modeling. Experiments in KITTI and self-collected sequences have been conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach by fusing stereo visual odometry (SVO) and heading measurements under road constraints. The proposed approach can be ameliorated by adding an absolute reference in translation to correct the inherent translational drift in VO.

AB The paper presents a concept of the vehicle/road infrastructure in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication for tagging and informing vehicles about the surrounded environment. A frame analysis and the influence of the data packet size on Ultra-wideband (UWB) were investigated. The authors have determined the distance that could be traveled by a vehicle at the given speed in relation to the amount of data that has to be transmitted during the ranging procedure. The authors propose a data frame format (using the IEEE 802.15.4a protocol) for coding/encoding the information about the road infrastructure efficiently during the positioning procedure. It affects to minimum the time that is required to exchange messages during the ranging and communication process. The whole system is an efficient and reliable element that enhances/extends the existing components of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), which will facilitate validation of the information obtained from devices such as lidar, radar or video. The impact of the transmitted payload to the distance traveled by car opens the door to future research on the possibility of implementing efficient vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication for autonomous driving or and other smart city solutions.

AB When individuals are accustomed to receiving information in automobiles, mobile data offloading is becoming more common. However, the effects of movement of the vehicle in correspondence to relative speed and direction between vehicles, have a significant impact on mobile data offloading. An innovative deep learning algorithm namely, intelligent deep neural network (IDNN) is proposed for vehicle data offloading and an optimal algorithm namely, quasi opposition based C-hen swarm optimization (QOCSO) is proposed for efficient vehicle resource allocation. Initially, the vehicles in the vehicular networks are clustered with the help of the cosine similarity-based K-means algorithm for transmitting the data in an energy-aware manner. Then cluster heads (CHs) are optimally selected for the generated clusters using Boltzmann selection probability-based earth worm algorithm. The selected CHs are responsible for collecting the data from the cluster members and that is forwarded to the roadside unit. Then the suitable mobile edge servers are selected according to the IDNN algorithm that offloads the data from the CHs to the appropriate server. These received tasks of the vehicles could be stored as a blockchain for providing security to the vehicular network and finally, the resource allocation of the incoming tasks to the vehicles is performed using the QOCSO algorithm. Experiment findings reveal that both offloading and resource scheduling techniques outperform existing state-of-the-art vehicular network algorithms.

AB Connected vehicles (CVs) exchange a variety of information instantly with surrounding vehicles and traffic facilities, which could smooth traffic flow significantly. The objective of this paper is to analyze the effect of CVs on running speed. This study compared the delay time, travel time, and running speed in the normal and the connected states, respectively, through VISSIM (a traffic simulation software developed by PTV company in German). The optimization speed model was established to simulate the decision-makings of CVs in MATLAB, considering the parameters of vehicle distance, average speed, and acceleration, etc. After the simulation, the vehicle information including speed, travel time, and delay time under the normal and the connected states were compared and evaluated, and the influence of different CV rates on the results was analyzed. In a two-lane arterial road, running speed in the connected state increase by 4 km/h, and the total travel time and delay time decrease by 5.34% and 16.76%, respectively, compared to those in the normal state. The optimal CV market penetration rate related to running speed and delay time is 60%. This simulation-based study applies user-defined lane change and lateral behavior rules, and takes different CV rates into consideration, which is more reliable and practical to estimate the impact of CV on road traffic characteristics.

AB A vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) electromagnetic system is studied to estimate the lateral position of a vehicle in its lane. This system can be include in an advanced driving assistance system (ADAS) in order to provide the vehicle lateral positions to warn the driver in case of an involuntary road lane departure or to drive the car in case of autonomous driving. The developed system consists of passive electromagnetic transponders embedded in the lane markings, each one contains two surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators that have two different center frequencies, and a hyperfrequency transceiver embedded in the lateral sides of the vehicle. The system operates in the ultrahigh frequency (UHF) band. The phase difference of arrival (PDoA) method for distance measurement is used to estimate the absolute lateral distance between the vehicle and the lane markings. A method is developed to recover the useful phases from the global response of the system using its frequency response, around the two resonance frequencies of the SAW resonators. The system is tested in outdoor environment and the results of the useful phases recovering method are accurate, where the absolute distance estimation gives an error lower than 3 cm.

AB Navigating through roadworks represents one of the main sources of safety risk for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) due to the altered road layouts. The built-in base maps do not normally reflect these changes, causing CAVs to experience difficulties in sensing and trajectory generation. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to evaluate different collision-free trajectory generation for CAVs at roadworks to improve safety and traffic performance. Trajectory generation algorithms using lane-level dynamic maps were examined for: 1) CAVs rely on data from in-vehicle sensor only; and 2) CAVs receive additional information via a Smart Traffic Cone (STC) in advance regarding roadwork configurations. Experiments were conducted at a controlled motorway facility operated by National Highways (England) using a vehicle instrumented with a suite of sensors. Schematics of the roadworks scenario were translated into an integrated simulation platform consisting of a traffic microsimulation (VISSIM) to simulate traffic dynamics and a sub-microscopic simulator (PreScan) capable of simulating vehicle autonomy and connectivity. Results indicate that traffic conflicts and delays decrease by 40% and 3% respectively when CAVs receive additional information in advance (i.e., Scenario 2) compared to the other scenario. These findings would assist road network operators in developing 'CAV-enabled roadworks' and vehicle manufacturers in designing a vehicle-based 'roadworks assist' system.

AB Recently, automated vehicles have been recognized as a promising tool to address the problem of on-ramp merging. However, the complexity of the problem includes ignorance of the vehicle's lateral dynamics, the limitation of the fixed merging point, the mismatch problem caused by the sequential optimization scheme, and the fixed terminal states assumption. These factors make it intractable in practical driving scenarios. This paper proposed an integrated optimization model for on-ramp automated vehicles, which can guide the vehicle to complete the merging behaviour from the ramp lane to the main lane safely and efficiently. A merging path is first constructed in the two-dimensional plane with two critical parameters recommended by a neural network predictor, enabling it to incorporate both longitudinal and lateral dynamics. Then, an integrated Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP) model is built to determine the optimal velocity profiles and merging gap simultaneously while considering the safety and efficiency factors. Specifically, with the introduction of discretization and linearization techniques, linear collision avoidance constraints and smooth transition constraints can be built, which can address the challenging computational problem. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated through the microscopic and macroscopic numerical results under different levels of mixed traffic.

ID ORIENTATION
AB The vehicular localization is a crucial technique in autonomous vehicle systems. This paper addresses an adaptive tracking method for robust vehicular localization even in shadowing conditions. The proposed tracking estimator consists of attitude estimation and position estimation. For the attitude estimation, the tracking estimator relies on inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a global positioning system (GPS). According to the shadowing condition, the presented estimator adaptively selects the IMU data and the GPS information in order to continuously estimate the vehicle attitude. Then, the tracking estimator utilizes the attitude estimates and the on-board diagnostics II (OBD-II) information in order to accurately estimate the vehicle position. The adaptive tracking approach allows robust vehicular localization since the vehicle attitude can reliably be achieved in shadowing and non-shadowing areas. Furthermore, the adaptive tracking method effectively exploits one extended Kalman filter for the estimations of vehicle attitude and position. This significantly alleviates the complexity of the tracking estimator. The simulation results verify that the adaptive tracking estimator accurately tracks the vehicle trajectory even in shadowing areas. The results also exhibit that the proposed tracking estimator outperforms the conventional tracking estimators in the aspects of localization performance.

AB This research is aimed at developing an efficient online path planner for unmanned air vehicle guidance in completely unknown three-dimensional (3D) rough terrain environments. A novel algorithm is proposed that directly incorporates the vehicle dynamics in the guidance strategy. A suitable point mass dynamic model is also developed. The flight path forms gradually as a result of applying the guidance commands to the vehicle dynamics. A key feature of this approach is real-time assessment of terrain characteristics and using this information in the guidance procedure. The problem is considered within a fuzzy behavior-based framework. The guidance algorithm uses acquired information from the onboard sensors and rapidly issues commands that will guide the vehicle safely to an intermediate position within the sensor range. Two behaviors are introduced: go to target and 3D terrain following/terrain avoidance. The issued commands are then integrated with adjustable weighting factors. Simulation results demonstrate a significant enhancement in vehicle autonomy level. Intelligent decision-making capability afforded by this approach allows for autonomous and safe low-level flight in mountainous areas. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been successfully applied to end-to-end autonomous driving, especially in simulation environments. However, common DRL approaches used in complex autonomous driving scenarios sometimes are unstable or difficult to converge. This paper proposes two approaches to improve the stability of the policy model training with as few manual data as possible. For the first approach, reinforcement learning is combined with imitation learning to train a feature network with a small amount of manual data for parameters initialization. For the second approach, an auxiliary network is added to the reinforcement learning framework, which can leverage the real-time measurement information to deepen the understanding of environment, without any guide of demonstrators. To verify the effectiveness of these two approaches, simulations in image information-based and lidar information-based end-to-end autonomous driving systems are conducted, respectively. These approaches are not only tested in the virtual game world, but also applied in Gazebo, in which we build a 3D world based on the real vehicle model of Ranger XP900 platform, the real 3D obstacle model, and the real motion constraints with inertial characteristics, so as to ensure that the trained end-to-end autonomous driving model is more suitable for the real world. Experimental results show that the performance is increased by over 45% in the virtual game world, and can converge quickly and stably in Gazebo in which previous methods can hardly converge.

TI Optimal Connected Cruise Control Design with Time-Varying Leader

ID VEHICLE SYSTEMS; STABILITY; DYNAMICS
AB With the development of intelligent transportation system (ITS), owing to its flexible connectivity structures and communication network topologies, connected cruise control (CCC), increasing the situation awareness of the autonomous vehicle without redesigning the other vehicles, is an advanced cruise control technology attracted extensive attention. However, due to the uncertain traffic environment and the movement of the connected vehicles, the leader speed is typically highly dynamic. In this paper, taking the uncertain time-varying leading vehicle velocity and communication delays into consideration, an optimal CCC algorithm is proposed for both near-static case and general dynamic control cases. First, the analysis for discrete-time error dynamics model of the longitudinal vehicle platoon is performed. Then, in order to minimize the error between the desired and actual states, a linear quadratic optimization problem is formulated. Subsequently, in near-static control case, an efficient algorithm is proposed to derive the solution of the optimization problem by two steps. Specifically, the online step calculates the optimal control scheme according to the current states and previous control signals, and the off-line step calculates the corresponding control gain through backward recursion. Then, the results are further extended to the general dynamic control case where the leader vehicle moves at an uncertain time-varying velocity. Finally, simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed CCC algorithm.

ID PROPAGATION
AB In the event of a disaster, first responders must rapidly gain situational awareness about the environment in order to plan effective response operations. Unmanned ground vehicles are well suited for this task but often require a strong communication link to a remote ground station to effectively relay information. When considering an obstacle-rich environment, non-line-of-sight conditions and naive navigation strategies can cause substantial degradations in radio link quality. Therefore, this paper incorporates an unmanned aerial vehicle as a radio repeating node and presents a path planning strategy to cooperatively navigate the vehicle team so that radio link health is maintained. This navigation technique is formulated as an A*-based search and this paper presents the formulation of this path planner as well as an investigation into strategies that provide computational efficiency to the search process. The path planner uses predictions of radio signal health at different vehicle configurations to effectively navigate the vehicles and simulations have shown that the path planner produces favorable results in comparison to several conceivable naive radio repeating variants. The results also show that the radio repeating path planner has outperformed the naive variants in both simulated environments and in field testing where a Yamaha RMAX unmanned helicopter and a ground vehicle were used as the vehicle team.

ID AUTOMATIC GUIDANCE
AB Off-road vehicle mobility is a real challenge in many areas such as agriculture, military, or construction machinery. The introduction of autonomous vehicles in these fields requires more advanced control algorithms. Furthermore, the deformable nature of the terrain has a significant impact on vehicle behavior. In this context, a lot of research has been conducted to describe the wheel-ground interaction phenomena. Among the most significant factors, traction force, lateral force, and wheel sinkage are crucial aspects in the study of vehicle mobility. One of the most used approaches is based on the Bekker-Wong description. However, due to the mathematical complexity of this model, this approach is rather intended for vehicle simulation. Since the design of control laws requires less complex models, this paper proposes a method based on a road tire model structure adapted to deformable surfaces. This modification is based on the original Burckhardt tire model with a modified structure and estimated parameters. Furthermore, the parameter identification is performed by simulating a realistic virtual test bench allowing the data collection for the parameter estimation process. Finally, the obtained results show the applicability of the proposed method through a new tire model called the Adapted Burchardt Tire Model (ABTM). (c) 2022 ISTVS. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Cooperative-ITS (C-ITS) is a rising innovation that involves the integration of existing intelligent vehicle technology and communication technology, which allows information exchange among components and autonomous cooperative driving among vehicles. Although some hardware platforms are developed for simulation of C-ITS applications, there are still some problems such as lack of global positioning, limited simulation scenarios, and high cost. This paper presents Micro Intelligent Vehicle (MicroIV)-based cooperative driving hardware simulation platform for simulation of C-ITS applications, especially the cooperative maneuvers. Different from existing platforms, cameras installed around the test field are used to capture the motion and global positioning information of micro vehicles, similar to GPS methods. Such system architecture reduces the vehicle's hardware configuration and significantly cuts the cost of the whole system. Then, it is easy to expand the scale of the experiments. Therefore, the proposed platform is flexible for different cooperation scenarios. Point-to-multipoint communication structure with the fixed master node is used to implement the communication between vehicles. Interacting Multiple Model method is leveraged to improve positioning accuracy. Experiments are conducted to prove that the proposed MicroIV platform can meet the positioning accuracy requirement of C-ITS application. Then, applications for both V2V and V2I cooperation are presented: platoon with 20 vehicles, intersection cooperation with 8 vehicles, merging, and automatic parking. These experiments prove the feasibility and reliability of the proposed platform for cooperative driving hardware simulation.

AB The necessity of vehicle fault detection and diagnosis (VFDD) is one of the main goals and demands of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) in autonomous applications. This paper integrates various machine learning algorithms, which are applied to the failure prediction and warning of various types of vehicles, such as the vehicle transmission system, abnormal engine operation, and tire condition prediction. This paper first discusses the three main AI algorithms, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, and compares the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm in the application of system prediction. In the second part, we summarize which artificial intelligence algorithm architectures are suitable for each system failure condition. According to the fault status of different vehicles, it is necessary to carry out the evaluation of the digital filtering process. At the same time, it is necessary to preconstruct its model analysis and adjust the parameter attributes, types, and number of samples of various vehicle prediction models according to the analysis results, followed by optimization to obtain various vehicle models. Finally, through a cross-comparison and sorting, the artificial intelligence failure prediction models can be obtained, which can correspond to the failure status of a certain car model and a certain system, thereby realizing a most appropriate AI model for a specific application.

AB Driven by advances in information and communication technologies, an increasing number of industries embrace unmanned and autonomous vehicles for services, such as public transportation, shipping, mapping, and remote surveillance. Unfortunately, these vehicles are vulnerable to passive and active cyber-physical attacks that can be used for industrial espionage and hijacking attempts. Since attackers can use hijacked vehicles as weapons in terrorist attacks, ensuring the secure operation of such vehicles is critical to prevent the attacks from causing dire financial consequences, or worse, the loss of human lives. This study is motivated by the observation that most cybersecurity studies provide superficial, high-level descriptions of vulnerabilities and attacks, and the true impact of the described attacks remains unclear. To address this problem, we demonstrate advanced manipulation attacks against an underactuated Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) which results in successful hijackings. Using state-of-the-art cryptography, we also show how the signal transmission can be secured to avoid hijacking attempts actively steering the vehicle off course. Through field experiments, we demonstrate how the attacks affect the closed-loop guidance, navigation, and control system and how the proposed countermeasures prevent these attacks from being successful. Our study is unique in that we provide a complete description of the attacked USV and give a detailed analysis of how spoofed navigation estimates affect the closed-loop behavior of the underactuated USV.

AB This paper is concerned with the distributed control of vehicle platoons. The dynamics of each vehicle are nonlinear and heterogeneous. The control objective is to regulate vehicles to travel at a common speed while maintaining desired intervehicle gaps. The information flow topology dictates the pattern of communication between vehicles in the platoon. This information is essential to effective platoon control and, therefore, plays a central role in affecting the design and performance of platoon control strategies. Our key contribution is a unified distributed control framework that explicitly incorporates and supports a diversity of information flow topologies. Specifically, we propose a distributed sliding mode control (DSMC) framework for a class of generic topologies. The DSMC constructs the topological sliding surface and reaching law via a so-called "topologically structured function." The control law obtained by matching the topological sliding surface and topological reaching law is naturally distributed. The Lyapunov stability analysis is carried out for the closed-loop system in the sense of Filippov to cope with the discontinuity originated from switching terms. Moreover, a tradeoff between tracking precision and chattering elimination is discussed with a continuous approximation of the switching control law. The effectiveness of the DSMC for platoons is verified under four different topologies through numerical simulation.

AB This paper proposes a constrained model predictive control (MPC) for tractor-trailer trucks with the complicated physical characteristics, where motion constraints can be considered to govern the vehicle maneuver. Firstly, a targeted theoretical derivation method is developed to establish a more accurate nonlinear model for articulated vehicles, with expressly considering the articulation coupling effects. As an essential basis, the kinematic coupling behavior is further investigated. Secondly, multi-source motion constraints are introduced in particular with the analysis of nonholonomic constraints on the underactuated trailer: (i) keeping trucks traveling in the feasible domain away from collision; (ii) maintaining the vehicle states in a stable field through the steady-state response and side-slip thresholds. Thirdly, a constrained MPC controller is constructed for the automatic tracking operation, wherein vehicle demands of position security and yaw stability will be taken into reasonable consideration. For this purpose, vehicle states information can be fully utilized in a parallel approach to optimize quadratic programming (QP) in MPC: model prediction and updated constraints. In the end, the contrasted-simulation analysis is carried out to verify the accuracy of derived model and effectiveness of the designed controller, along with the feasibility of the additive multi-source constraints.

AB Self-driving vehicles promise many safety, mobility, and environmental benefits. However, users' lack of trust and acceptance may threaten the success and potential of this technology. Monitoring the driver's emotional state is one way to address this challenge. Empathetic automation can respond to the driver's state and improve the experience and acceptance of self-driving vehicle drivers. In this study, 24 participants rode in a self-driving vehicle simulator and experienced three automation styles (aggressive, moderate, conservative) and four intersection types (with and without a stop sign, and with and without traffic.) We identified the observed drivers' emotions from the video data and labeled the video frames using the dimensional and discrete emotion models to examine how automation behavior affects the driver's emotional state. We used multilevel Bayesian linear regression and multilevel Dirichlet regression to model the continuous and discrete emotions, respectively. The automation driving style effect varied for each participant. The same conditions provoked positive responses for some participants, and negative for others. Furthermore, the results showed that intersection type, the position within the intersection, and their interaction affected the driver's emotional state. This indicates that personalized driver state monitoring systems might enhance drivers' experience in self-driving vehicles.

DT Article
ID FUZZY-LOGIC CONTROL; MACHINE VISION
AB A robotic platform for mapping of weed populations in fields was used to demonstrate intelligent concepts for autonomous vehicles in agriculture which may eventually result in a new sustainable model for developed agriculture. The vehicle presented here is adapted to operate in 0.25 and 0.5 in row crops and equipped with cameras for row guidance and weed detection. A modular approach is taken, with four identical wheel modules, allowing four wheel steering and propulsion of the platform. The result is improved mobility which allows parallel displacement of the vehicle during turns by decoupling adjustments in position from adjustments in orientation. Control of the platform is provided through a vehicle electronics and control system based on embedded controllers and standard communication protocols. The software Implements a hybrid deliberate software architecture that allows a hierarchical decomposition of the operation. The lowest level implements a reactive feedback control mechanism based on an extension of simple control for car-like vehicles to the four wheel case. The controller design forces the front and rear of the vehicle to follow a predetermined path and allows the vehicle to maintain a fixed orientation relative to the path. The controller rationale is outlined and results from experiments in the field are presented. (C) 2003 Silsoe Research Institute. All rights reserved Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents modeling and control law design for a bi-tiltrotor unmanned aerial vehicle for autonomous payload delivery. An ultralight bi-tiltrotor aerial vehicle was developed for a payload delivery contest using only two motors attached to a carbon fiber tube with an additional cube basket to carry the payload. To achieve desirable three-dimensional (3D) trajectory tracking performance with unknown payload, an adaptive control system has been developed, which consists of two components: (1) a baseline control law, including a lateral speed controller, forward speed controller, yaw angle controller, and altitude controller; and (2) an adaptive augmentation to all these four channels to compensate for modeling uncertainties and disturbances caused by the payload, which has large influence on system dynamics due to the light weight of the vehicle. A mathematical model of the vehicle has been built using the Newton-Euler method and simplified based on reasonable assumptions to facilitate control design. The baseline control law employs conventional proportional-derivative control structure. Subsequently, L-1 adaptive control theory is adopted in the adaptive augmentation design. Simulation examples verify the efficacy of the proposed adaptive control solution. (C) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

   fusion; D-S evidence theory
AB Vehicle detection is essential for driverless systems. However, the current single sensor detection mode is no longer sufficient in complex and changing traffic environments. Therefore, this paper combines camera and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to build a vehicle-detection framework that has the characteristics of multi adaptability, high real-time capacity, and robustness. First, a multi-adaptive high-precision depth-completion method was proposed to convert the 2D LiDAR sparse depth map into a dense depth map, so that the two sensors are aligned with each other at the data level. Then, the You Only Look Once Version 3 (YOLOv3) real-time object detection model was used to detect the color image and the dense depth map. Finally, a decision-level fusion method based on bounding box fusion and improved Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory was proposed to merge the two results of the previous step and obtain the final vehicle position and distance information, which not only improves the detection accuracy but also improves the robustness of the whole framework. We evaluated our method using the KITTI dataset and the Waymo Open Dataset, and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed depth completion method and multi-sensor fusion strategy.

   localization; magnetic marker system; positioning
AB Real-time continuous localization is a key technology in the development of intelligent transportation systems. In these systems, it is very important to have accurate information about the position and heading angle of the vehicle at all times. The most widely implemented methods for positioning are the global positioning system (GPS), vision-based system, and magnetic marker system. Among these methods, the magnetic marker system is less vulnerable to indoor and outdoor environment conditions; moreover, it requires minimal maintenance expenses. In this paper, we present a position estimation scheme based on magnetic markers and odometry sensors for an all-wheel-steering vehicle. The heading angle of the vehicle is determined by using the position coordinates of the last two detected magnetic markers and odometer data. The instant position and heading angle of the vehicle are integrated with an extended Kalman filter to estimate the continuous position. GPS data with the real-time kinematics mode was obtained to evaluate the performance of the proposed position estimation system. The test results show that the performance of the proposed localization algorithm is accurate (mean error: 3 cm; max error: 9 cm) and reliable under unexpected missing markers or incorrect markers.

AB Due to the spatio-temporal complexity in energy consumption profiles of multiple consumers at different regions, it is expected that more cost savings and higher resiliency to power disruptions can be achieved using a network of mobile prosumers. In this paper, the prosumer is assumed to be an autonomous vehicle equipped with different distributed energy resources (e.g., solar panel, battery) that cannot only provide but also consume energy. An integrated vehicle routing and energy scheduling decision model is developed to adaptively dispatch vehicles to balance the temporally and spatially distributed energy requests subject to vehicle mobility constraints, and thus to maximally exploit the potentials of mobile prosumer network for cost savings and carbon emission reductions. The performances of the integrated decision model are evaluated using three metrics including operational costs, energy requested from power grids, and carbon emissions. The simulation results demonstrate that compared to disjoint vehicle routing and energy scheduling model, the proposed integrated decision model (i) is more efficient to shift energy loads at both temporal and spatial scales, and (ii) can save up to 38% of operational costs, reduce up to 29% of energy requested from power grids, and reduce up to 27% of carbon emissions.

DT Article
DE automotive vehicles; autonomous driving; vision systems
AB Following a very brief look at the human vision system, an extended summary of our own elemental steps towards future vision systems for ground vehicles is given, leading to the proposal made in the main part. The question is raised of why the predominant solution in biological vision systems, namely pairs of eyes (very often multi-focal and gaze-controllable), has not been found in technical systems up to now, though it may be a useful or even optimal solution for vehicles too. Two potential candidates with perception capabilities closer to the human sense of vision are discussed in some detail: one with all cameras mounted in a fixed way onto the body of the vehicle, and one with a multi-focal gaze-controllable set of cameras. Such compact systems are considered advantageous for many types of vehicles if a human level of performance in dynamic real-time vision and detailed scene understanding is the goal. Increasingly general realizations of these types of vision systems may take all of the 21st century to be developed. The big challenge for such systems with the capability of learning while seeing will be more on the software side than on the hardware side required for sensing and computing.

AB Moving vehicles have a considerable negative effect on the accuracy of scan registration and lidar odometry. To remove the negative effect, we propose an extended 2D virtual scan to obtain all moving objects in the sensing range of lidar by a scan differencing operation between two consecutive scans. The dynamic objects' poses are estimated with our proposed likelihood-field-based vehicle measurement model and the motion evidence is utilized to classify the objects as moving vehicles or not. In this way, the moving/dynamic vehicles are detected and the points hitting them are removed. The remaining points are then taken as an input into the alignment.
   In the registration, we adjust the raw distorted points by modeling the lidar motion as the constant angular and linear velocities within a scan interval, and then exploit the probabilistic framework to model the local plane structure of the matched feature points instead of the original point-to-point mode. The transform is achieved by the combination of coarse motion estimation and fine batch adjustment. The algorithm has been validated by a large set of qualitative tests on our collected point clouds and quantitative comparisons with the excellent methods on the public Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute (KITTI) odometry datasets.

AB An autonomous vehicle would benefit from being able to predict trajectories of other vehicles in its vicinity for improved safety. In order for the self-driving car to plan safe trajectories, paths of nearby vehicles are required to be predicted for risk assessment, decision making, and motion planning. In this study, a trajectory prediction algorithm based on the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) estimation strategy is proposed to predict paths involving lane-changing, lane-keeping, and turning motion. More specifically, the Interacting Multiple Model estimation technique is used with models defined in curvi-linear coordinates to predict a vehicle's trajectory based on prior behavioral maneuvers. The road geometry is used to help facilitate behavior identification and prediction. Moreover, the combination of a more recently developed estimation technique known as the Generalized Variable Boundary Layer-Smooth Variable Structure Filter and the Interacting Multiple Model Estimator is applied to track, identify behaviors, and predict trajectories of a vehicle. The performance of this technique is compared with a Kalman Filter based formulation using synthetic and experimental data. This model-based strategy is also compared with machine learning-based strategies for trajectory prediction.

AB High-precision position, velocity, and orientation information is essential for vehicles to achieve autonomous driving. In this contribution, we propose a multi-sensor integration system for high-precision vehicle navigation, based on the fusion of GNSS PPP-RTK, MEMS IMU, and wheel odometer. Meanwhile, to fully use the physical characteristics of vehicle-specific motion, vehicle motion constraints (VMC) are used in conjunction with the wheel odometer. In the proposed system, the data from all sensors and vehicle motion constraints are tightly integrated into Kalman Filter. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed system, a series of real urban vehicle-borne experiments including different scenarios were conducted. Results indicate that using the proposed system, the position error RMS is (0.02 m, 0.02 m, 0.06 m) in the east, north, and vertical directions, with 95.2% availability of high-precision positioning (horizontal $<$ 10 cm, vertical $<$ 20 cm). The continuous and stable high-precision positioning could be maintained in the typical scenarios of GNSS degradation, such as boulevards, viaducts and tunnels. In addition, tests with simulated GNSS outages statistically demonstrate that this proposed system is capable of achieving 5.3dead reckoning error with a maximum position error of 0.86 m in the case of simulated 30 s outages.

AB The timeless and efficient vehicle data transmission are the two common requirements for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), especially the Unnamed Aircraft Vehicle (UAV)-aided Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) network. Moreover, since the Age of Information (AoI) performance greatly influences these two indicators, data quality should be guaranteed in vehicle communication. However, few researchers pay attention to the AoI performance optimization issue regarding wireless resource constraint, transmission interference, and vehicle cooperation in recent years. To close this research gap, we propose an AoI-oriented channel access strategy in the UAV-aided VEC network from the game theory viewpoint. Firstly, the UAV-aided VEC network model and edge computing-based AoI expression are established and derived in the closed form, respectively. Subsequently, we transform the AoI minimization problem into an AoI-based channel access issue from the game theory viewpoint. Moreover, the stochastic learning-based algorithm is proposed to find the Nash Equilibrium (NE) solution of the formulated problem. Finally, simulation results evaluate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, where our scheme can achieve the better AoI value compared with baselines.

ID GAUSSIAN PROCESS; VEHICLES; SAFETY
AB With the development of autonomous driving technology, the requirements for machine perception have increased significantly. In particular, camera-based lane detection plays an essential role in autonomous vehicle trajectory planning. However, lane detection is subject to high complexity, and it is sensitive to illumination variation, appearance, and age of lane marking. In addition, the sheer infinite number of test cases for highly automated vehicles requires an increasing portion of test and validation to be performed in simulation and X-in-the-loop testing. To model the complexity of camera-based lane detection, physical models are often used, which consider the optical properties of the imager as well as image processing itself. This complexity results in high efforts for the simulation in terms of modelling as well as computational costs. This paper presents a Phenomenological Lane Detection Model (PLDM) to simulate camera performance. The innovation of the approach is the modelling technique using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which is a class of Neural Network (NN). In order to prepare input data for our neural network model, massive driving tests have been performed on the M86 highway road in Hungary. The model's inputs include vehicle dynamics signals (such as speed and acceleration, etc.). In addition, the difference between the reference output from the digital-twin map of the highway and camera lane detection results is considered as the target of the NN. The network consists of four hidden layers, and scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation is used for training the network. The results demonstrate that PLDM can sufficiently replicate camera detection performance in the simulation. The modelling approach improves the realism of camera sensor simulation as well as computational effort for X-in-the-loop applications and thereby supports safety validation of camera-based functionality in automated driving, which decreases the energy consumption of vehicles.

AB Accurate vehicular sensing is a basic and important operation in autonomous driving. Unfortunately, the existing techniques have their own limitations. For instance, the communication-based approach (e.g., transmission of GPS information) has high latency and low reliability while the reflection-based approach (e.g., RADAR) is incapable of detecting hidden vehicles (HVs) without line-of-sight. This is arguably the reason behind some recent fatal accidents involving autonomous vehicles. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel HV-sensing technology that exploits multi-path transmission from a HV to a sensing vehicle (SV). The powerful technology enables the SV to detect multiple HV-state parameters including position, orientation of driving direction, and size. Its implementation does not even require synchronization like conventional mobile positioning techniques. Our design approach leverages estimated information on multi-path [namely their angles-of-arrival (AoA), angles-of-departure (AoD), and time-of-arrival (ToA)] and their geometric relations. As a result, a complex system of equations or optimization problems, where the desired HV-state parameters are variables, can be formulated for different channel-noise conditions. The development of intelligent solution methods ranging from least-square estimator to disk/box minimization yields a set of practical HV-sensing techniques. We study their feasibility conditions in terms of the required number of paths. Furthermore, practical solutions, including sequential path combining and random directional beamforming, are proposed to enable HV-sensing given insufficient paths. Last, realistic simulation of driving in both highway and rural scenarios demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. In summary, the proposed technique will enhance the capabilities of existing vehicular sensing technologies (e.g., RADAR and LIDAR) by enabling HV-sensing.

AB The Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) is a wireless network of intelligent and autonomous vehicles and Roadside Units (RSUs), which work together to improve transportation services. On the one hand, this revolutionary mode of transportation optimizes traffic efficiency and reduces congestion and accidents; on the other hand, it raises security and privacy concerns. As a result, keeping the security and privacy aspects of such vital systems should be a top concern, as security and privacy flaws can have devastating implications. In addition, each vehicle's on-board unit (OBU) has a certain amount of processing and storage power. As a result, in areas with high traffic density, vehicles that need to verify messages have a very high computational overhead. In this article, we propose a conditional privacy-preserving heterogeneous signcryption scheme for IoV utilizing Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC) operation. The security robustness of the proposed scheme has been evaluated with the Random Oracle Model (ROM), a formal security evaluation method. In addition, relevant existing schemes are compared to the proposed scheme in terms of computation and communication costs. The findings demonstrate that the proposed scheme is both efficient and secure, validating its viability.

AB INTRODUCTION: The advent of autonomous automobiles raises new challenges for maintaining passenger safety and comfort. The challenge addressed here is how to predict and mitigate motion sickness when passengers read in a moving vehicle.
   METHODS: We utilized a car equipped with a commercial active suspension system developed for attenuating the transmission of road surface fluctuations to passengers.The system was used to reproduce, in a parked car, either the vibrations that would be experienced in a moving car equipped with a conventional suspension system (unmitigated ride) or the attenuated vibrations that would occur on the road with the active cancellation system engaged (mitigated ride). We evaluated the consequences of these two simulated ride conditions for reading performance, comfort, and evocation of motion sickness.
   RESULTS: Both ride conditions reduced the 0 to 8 Hz vibrations to below threshold for evoking motion sickness during passive exposure. Only the mitigated ride condition attenuated frequencies in the 0.8 to 8 Hz band where visual suppression of the vestibulo-ocular reflex is known to break down, and this condition also reduced the motion sickness induced by reading and increased reading comprehension and comfort relative to the unmitigated ride.
   DISCUSSION: The palliative effects of 0.8 to 8 Hz attenuation are discussed in terms of the different mechanisms underlying motion sickness evoked by reading in a vehicle versus mere exposure to vehicle motion without reading. Implications for ISO-2631 standards for human exposure to vibration are also discussed.

ID PERFORMANCE; SYSTEM
AB This paper reports the development and comparative performance evaluation, using laboratory and at-sea field data, of new methods for the problem of in situ calibration of the alignment rotation matrix between Doppler sonar velocity sensors and attitude sensors arising in the navigation of underwater vehicles. Most previously reported solutions to this alignment calibration problem require the use of absolute navigation fixes of the underwater vehicle, thus requiring additional navigation sensors and/or beacons to be located externally and apart from the underwater vehicle. We report four novel alignment calibration methods employing only internal vehicle navigation sensors for velocity, acceleration, attitude, and depth. We report the results of comparative analysis of the performance of these new methods and a previously reported method with a navigation laboratory and at-sea field data. Laboratory data were obtained with the Johns Hopkins University JHU remotely operated underwater vehicle in the JHU Hydrodynamic Test Facility. At-sea field data were obtained from deep-water survey missions of the Sentry autonomous underwater vehicle conducted in March, 2011 in the Kermadec Arc in the Southern Pacific Ocean. In addition, we report a comparative experimental evaluation of several recently reported calibration methods when employing low-cost microelectromechanical system attitude sensors. In all these cases, the results reveal consistent differences in performance of the various methods when analyzed on navigation data from several different vehicle dives.

AB Automatic recognition and prediction of in-vehicle human activities has a significant impact on the next generation of driver assistance and intelligent autonomous vehicles. In this article, we present a novel single image driver action recognition algorithm inspired by human perception that often focuses selectively on parts of the images to acquire information at specific places which are distinct to a given task. Unlike existing approaches, we argue that human activity is a combination of pose and semantic contextual cues. In detail, we model this by considering the configuration of body joints, their interaction with objects being represented as a pairwise relation to capture the structural information. Our body-pose and body-object interaction representation is built to be semantically rich and meaningful, which is highly discriminative even though it is coupled with a basic linear SVM classifier. We also propose a Multi-stream Deep Fusion Network (MDFN) for combining high-level semantics with CNN features. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the drivers' action recognition accuracy on two exacting datasets.

AB The connected and automated vehicle (CAV) is regarded as an effective way to improve traffic efficiency and safety, which can utilize vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication technology to obtain real-time status information from multiple preceding vehicles. In view of the car-following characteristic of CAV in a V2V communications environment, an extended car-following model AHT-FVD is proposed which takes both average headway and electronic throttle angle difference into account. The stability of this model is examined via linear stability analysis. It is found that the proposed model has a larger stability region than both the full velocity difference (FVD) model and throttle-based FVD (T-FVD) model. Namely, this AHT-FVD model can effectively stabilize traffic flow and alleviate traffic congestion in theory. Moreover, a series of numerical simulations are carried out to explore how average headway together with electronic throttle angle difference influences the stability of traffic flow. Simulation results show that increasing either the average headway weight or the electronic throttle angle difference control signal coefficients can yield higher traffic flow stability. Simulation result is highly consistent with theoretical analysis.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB The emergence of mobile edge computing provides an efficient and stable computing platform for intelligent applications of autonomous vehicles, and deep neural network (DNN) based tasks collaborative inference through joint device-edge is considered an effective way to reduce latency. However, the computing resources allocated to the vehicle are dynamic as the number of requesters changes due to the limitation of edge server resources, which causes the best partition point of the DNN is not fixed. In this paper, we consider a dynamic resource allocation scheme to select the best partition point of DNN inference tasks by vehicle-edge collaborative computing. Specifically, the latency constrained DNN tasks of vehicles are partially offloaded to edge at the granularity of DNN layers. Considering the heterogeneity of vehicular computing capabilities and multiple DNN inference tasks, we formulate an optimization problem for dynamic resource allocation and automatically select the best partition point to minimize the overall latency of all vehicles, which is NP-hard. Then we design a chemical reaction optimization based algorithm for low complexity to solve the problem. The results of extensive evaluations illustrate that our proposed scheme is superior to other baseline schemes in terms of overall latency, and with lower failure rate.

AB Wireless power transfer (WPT) is an enabling technology for electric vehicles (EV), as it eliminates driver intervention during charging. Major challenges to the adoption ofWPT systems include coil misalignment and large air-gap WPT, both of which degrade the transfer efficiency. To address these issues, this article presents a compact WPT charger for the rear of an EV, capable of correcting lateral misalignment.x using two integrated electromagnetic coils. The air-gap.y is reduced due to the rear placement of the charging pads. The variation in.y, however, increases due to vehicle parking accuracy, which impacts the operation of the electromagnetic coils. This article proposes a closed-loop threestage position-correcting control algorithm capable of detecting the impedance and resonant frequency of the system, which, in conjunction with the electromagnetic coils, results in improved vehicle alignment. The experimental prototype achieves a peak dc-dc efficiency of 90.1% at 5 kW WPT. With.y = 50 mm, the electromagnetic coils laterally align the pads within 1.75 s and correct.x as large as 240 mm. The position-correcting control was successfully demonstrated in four parking scenarios with the charging pads being corrected to within a 10-mm radius of perfect alignment.

AB Roadside unit (RSU) is a communication device for vehicular networks that provides vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) connectivity to nearby vehicles. It allows broadcasting of traffic and safety information, Internet connectivity, shared storage, advertisement, as well as supporting and enhancing vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication for future autonomous vehicles. However, high cost of its deployment and management has so far prevented RSUs from being used widely in practice despite its utility and importance. In this paper, we investigate the performance-cost tradeoff and viability of using buses as mobile RSUs (mRSUs). Although there have been some prior works that suggest the use of cars, public transportation, and controlled vehicles as mRSUs to address the cost problem of static RSUs (sRSUs), their assumptions were mostly rather idealistic. We aim to provide a more realistic view of the problem. Through real-world measurements, experiments, analysis, and simulation, we show how mRSUs can replace sRSUs while maintaining the same level of throughput, contact time, and inter-contact time. Our results provide a basis for judging whether it is beneficial to complement sRSUs with mRSUs depending on the deployment environment and cost-performance tradeoff.

AB In highways, lane markings are undoubtedly the most widely used landmarks for vehicle localization. However, they have a drawback in that they lack information on longitudinal position estimation and ego-lane identification. To alleviate this drawback, this paper presents a practical vehicle localization system for highways. The proposed system utilizes lane endpoints to enhance longitudinal position accuracy and road signs to improve the ego-lane identification accuracy. This system efficiently fuses the lane markings, lane endpoints and road signs along with a digital map and other low-cost sensors in a particle filter framework. Since it only uses low-cost sensors such as a monocular front-view camera, in-vehicle wheel speed and yaw rate sensors, as well as a low-end global positioning system (GPS), it is ready to mount on mass-produced vehicles. In the experiment, the proposed system was quantitatively evaluated using a dataset obtained while driving on 40 km stretch of highway, and outperformed previous approaches by showing a lateral position error of less than 0.12 m and a longitudinal position error of less than 0.25 m in terms of root mean square error (RMSE).

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; PATH LATERAL DEVIATION
AB With new developments in sensor technology, a new generation of vehicle dynamics controllers is developing, where the braking and steering strategies use more information, e.g. knowledge of road borders. The basis for vehicle-safety systems is how the forces from tyre-road interaction is vectored to achieve optimal total force and moment on the vehicle. To study this, the concept of attainable forces previously proposed in literature is adopted, and here a new visualisation technique is devised. It combines the novel concept of attainable force volumes with an interpretation of how the optimal solution develops within this volume. A specific finding is that for lane-keeping it is important to maximise the force in a certain direction, rather than to control the direction of the force vector, even though these two strategies are equivalent for the friction-limited particle model previously used in some literature for lane-keeping control design. More specifically, it is shown that the optimal behaviour develops on the boundary surface of the attainable force volume. Applied to lane-keeping control, this observation indicates a set of control principles similar to those analytically obtained for friction-limited particle models in earlier research, but result in vehicle behaviour close to the globally optimal solution also for more complex models and scenarios.

AB Detailed road features like lane markers and stop bars are crucial for many recent Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications, especially for advanced driving assistant systems or autonomous vehicles. In this paper, a data-driven method is proposed to identify intersection areas and map stop bar positions without prior knowledge of road information. The proposed method includes 1) a novel and efficient approach to identify intersections by analyzing the entropy of vehicles' moving directions; and 2) a statistical model for estimating the number, coordinates, and directions of stop bars by evaluating the upstream vehicles' stopping locations. By applying the method to real-world vehicle positioning data collected at Ann Arbor, its applicability and robustness to handle data at an urban regional scale (a 1.2 km by 2 km rectangular area) are proven. The accuracy of intersection identification is 95.7% for trajectory covered regions. For stop bar positioning, the mean and standard deviation of the errors are 0.27 m and 0.32 m respectively, which satisfy most of the mobility and eco-driving connected and automated vehicle applications such as eco-approach and departure at signalized intersections.

AB Modelling the dynamic behaviour of heavy vehicles, such as buses or trucks, can be very useful for driving simulation and training, autonomous driving, crash analysis, etc. However, dynamic modelling of a vehicle is a difficult task because there are many subsystems and signals that affect its behaviour. In addition, it might be hard to combine data because available signals come at different rates, or even some samples might be missed due to disturbances or communication issues. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive data acquisition hardware/software setup to carry out several experiments with an urban bus, in order to collect data from one of the internal communication networks and other embedded systems. Subsequently, non-conventional sampling data fusion using a Kalman filter has been implemented to fuse data gathered from different sources, connected through a wireless network (the vehicle's internal CAN bus messages, IMU, GPS, and other sensors placed in pedals). Our results show that the proposed combination of experimental data gathering and multi-rate filtering algorithm allows useful signal estimation for vehicle identification and modelling, even when data samples are missing.

ID PICKUP
AB Charging time and power transfer efficiency are the main challenges of wireless power transfer for electric vehicles. It is proposed in this paper to resolve both issues using the transformer induction concept as well as adaptive robotic technology. To this end, an autonomous robotic arm equipped with several sensors is mounted to the vehicle's undercarriage that carries a receiving coil. In case that the vehicle is parked in a parking spot equipped with wireless power transmitters, the robot will locate the receiving coil on the right place that is above the transmitting core when the vehicle is parked. When the vehicle is driven on a road equipped with the wireless power transmission system, the proposed mechanism provides the driver with signals that indicate the most efficient driving trajectory. To achieve the maximum efficiency, an advanced mathematical adaptive algorithm based on the extremum seeking method is employed. In addition, silicon carbide metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor is used in power converter to retain the frequency as high as possible to decrease the charging time. Through this method, the above issues and the problem of large non-permeable air gap and accordingly electromagnetic interference are resolved; while, the charging time is decreased dramatically.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop an efficient method for solving a vehicle scheduling problem (VSP) in 2D industrial environments. An autonomous vehicle is requested to serve a set of work centers in the shop floor providing transport and delivery tasks while avoiding collisions with obstacles during its travel. The objective is to find a minimum in length, collision-free vehicle routing schedule that serves timely as many as possible work centers in the shop floor.
   Design/methodology/approach - First, the vehicle's environment is mapped into a 2D B-Spline surface embedded in 3D Euclidean space using a robust geometric model. Then, a modified genetic algorithm is applied on the generated surface to search for an optimum legal route schedule that satisfies the requirements of the vehicle's mission.
   Findings - Simulation experiments show that the method is robust enough and can determine in a reasonable computation time a solution to VSP under consideration.
   Originality/value - There is a gap in the literature for methods that face VSP in shop-floor environments. This paper contributes to filling this gap by implementing a practical method that can be easily programmed and included in a modern service delivery system.

AB The engagement of a group of autonomous air vehicles against several targets is a major challenge in mission planning. This paper addresses the problem of cooperative flight path planning where the air vehicles should arrive at the destinations simultaneously or sequentially with specified time delays, while minimizing the total mission time. This involves finding an optimal assignment of air vehicles to targets and generating trajectories in compliance with the kinematic constraints of the vehicles. The trajectories have to avoid nofly-areas, threats and other obstacles, and must prevent the air vehicles from colliding with each other. The presented algorithm for simultaneous arrival first calculates shortest flight paths between all pairs of air vehicles and targets using a network-based routing model. An optimal assignment and a critical path is found by solving a linear bottleneck assignment problem with costs corresponding to the lengths of the shortest paths. The other flight paths are prolongated to the length of the critical path by automatic insertion of waypoints. This is achieved by concatenating subpaths stored in different shortest-path-trees. Due to the special structure of the network, all concatenated flight paths are flyable and feasible. Sequential arrival at a target is realized by sorting the flight paths according to their lengths and prolongating them whenever necessary to accomplish the desired time delays. The capability of the approach is demonstrated by simulation results.

AB A full vehicle dynamics simulator was constructed in SimCreator (R) for the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) Instrumented Vehicle (CIV) and was used to investigate and validate the newly developed Vehicle Terrain Interaction (VTI) code. The VTI code replaces the tire component of the simulated vehicle, in the Driver and Motion Simulator (DMS), allowing it to report back realistic values while driving oil various types of terrain surfaces such as mud, snow, ice, and pavement. The validation effort within this paper is focused oil the winter (snow and ice) parts of the VTI code. The outputs from the Engineering Research and Development Center (ERDC) and the DMS VTI codes were validated through field experiments and against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Reference Mobility Model (NRMM). The DMS VTI code can be used with different vehicle models, providing the US. Army with a valuable asset that will allow simulation of existing or conceptual, manned or autonomous, ground vehicle performance for acquisition, planning, or training. This information, along with some basic terrain information, will allow troops to plan the fastest and most effective way of getting to a desired location, while minimizing the possibility of being delayed because of the terrain conditions.

AB In this study, we designed two user interfaces for automated vehicles operated in the modes that correspond to the Society of Automotive Engineers automation levels 0-3. The first is a level-centred interface that allows the driver to increase or decrease the automation level step-by-step. The second is a function-centred interface that has independent driving controls in the longitudinal and lateral directions. We implemented prototypes for the two interfaces and conducted driver-in-the-loop experiments on a driving simulator to verify their effectiveness in the driver's mode awareness. For events on the road, the participants took actions to control the vehicle, which might cause mode changes, and answered the modes he/she believed. The experimental results show that the mode confusion rate of the level-centred interface is twice higher than that of the function-centred interface. Also, visual feedbacks can reduce the mode confusion rate dramatically. The results show that a function-centred user interface combined with adequate visual and/or auditory feedback is essential to improve driver's mode awareness when driving an automated vehicle.

ID COMPUTER VISION; LANE DETECTION; CLASSIFICATION
AB One major concern in the development of intelligent vehicles is to improve the driving safety. It is also an essential issue for future autonomous driving and intelligent transportation. In this paper, we present a vision-based system for driving assistance. A front and a rear on-board camera are adopted for visual sensing and environment perception. The purpose is to avoid potential traffic accidents due to forward collision and vehicle overtaking, and assist the drivers or self-driving cars to perform safe lane change operations. The proposed techniques consist of lane change detection, forward collision warning, and overtaking vehicle identification. A new cumulative density function (CDF)-based symmetry verification method is proposed for the detection of front vehicles. The motion cue obtained from optical flow is used for overtaking detection. It is further combined with a convolutional neural network to remove repetitive patterns for more accurate overtaking vehicle identification. Our approach is able to adapt to a variety of highway and urban scenarios under different illumination conditions. The experiments and performance evaluation carried out on real scene images have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

TI Real-Time Vehicle Detection Algorithm Based on Vision and Lidar Point

SO JOURNAL OF SENSORS
LA English
DT Article
AB Vehicle detection is one of the most important environment perception tasks for autonomous vehicles. The traditional vision-based vehicle detection methods are not accurate enough especially for small and occluded targets, while the light detection and ranging- (lidar-) based methods are good in detecting obstacles but they are time-consuming and have a low classification rate for different target types. Focusing on these shortcomings to make the full use of the advantages of the depth information of lidar and the obstacle classification ability of vision, this work proposes a real-time vehicle detection algorithm which fuses vision and lidar point cloud information. Firstly, the obstacles are detected by the grid projection method using the lidar point cloud information. Then, the obstacles are mapped to the image to get several separated regions of interest (ROIs). After that, the ROIs are expanded based on the dynamic threshold and merged to generate the final ROI. Finally, a deep learning method named You Only Look Once (YOLO) is applied on the ROI to detect vehicles. The experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has high detection accuracy and good real-time performance. Compared with the detection method based only on the YOLO deep learning, the mean average precision (mAP) is increased by 17%.

AB A collapsible drogue parachute system developed for the X-37 approach and landing test vehicle is described. Originally, the approach and landing test vehicle test program called for a vehicle drop from a B-52 at 42,500-ft altitude. The approach and landing test vehicle relied on autonomous control for all phases of flight, including release, approach, and landing.. If a software failure induced a control surface hardover during separation, the low vehicle weight and moderate subsonic lift-to-drag ratio made it possible for recontact with the B-52 after release. To eliminate recontact possibility, a drogue parachute system was installed. The drogue was deployed before the approach and landing test vehicle drop and was jettisoned after clean separation. The high altitude at drogue release allowed predominant winds to take the chute off the Edwards Air Force Base test range and into the flight corridors of major commercial airports. A mechanism to collapse to the drogue was required to keep the landing point within the test range. A simple passive-reefing mechanism that relied on a silicone band attached at the drogue skirt was developed. At high dynamic pressure the band stretched to the skirt diameter, causing negligible drag loss, but retracted and significantly reduced drag area after jettison. Test results and the design evolution are reported.

AB In this paper the issue of autonomous navigation is addressed, i.e. the ability for a navigation system to provide information about the states of a vehicle without the need for a priori infrastructures such as the global positioning system (GPS), beacons or preloaded maps of the area of interest. The algorithm applied is known as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). It is a terrain-aided navigation system that has the capability for on-line map building, while simultaneously utilizing the generated map to bound the errors in the navigation solution. As no a priori terrain information nor initial knowledge of the vehicle location is required, this algorithm presents a powerful navigation augmentation system. More importantly, it can be implemented as an independent navigation system. This paper also describes a decentralized SLAM algorithm that allows multiple vehicles to acquire a joint three-dimensional map via a decentralized information fusion network. The key idea behind this decentralized SLAM is to represent the map in information form (negative log likelihood) for communication. Experimental results are provided using computer simulation to demonstrate the single-vehicle and multi-vehicle SLAMs without the use of GPS and preloaded maps.

AB In this paper, we investigate the influence of the maximum platoon size of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) on the traffic safety of traffic flow mixed with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs. First, the spatial distributions of vehicles within the mixed traffic flow are analyzed. On this basis, the car-following characteristics of different vehicles are obtained. Second, the distribution probability of the four car-following modes in mixed traffic flow is derived based on the maximum platoon size of CAVs. Then, the intelligent driver model (IDM), gap-regulating model, cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) model, and adaptive cruise control (ACC) model are used to capture the four different car-following modes, respectively. Finally, multiple safety measures, such as the coefficient of variation of the vehicle speed, time exposed time-to-collision (TET), and time-integrated time-to-collision (TIT), are adopted to evaluate the safety of mixed traffic flow. Moreover, the impact of platoon size on the safety of mixed traffic flows is evaluated based on a numerical simulation. The results demonstrate that the magnitude of the impact of the platoon size of CAVs on the safety of mixed traffic flow is related to the penetration rate of CAVs. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Vehicular cloud computing (VCC) is an emerging research area of cloud and vehicular networking. It equips vehicles with networking and sensing capacities for vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-infrastructure communication with available roadside infrastructure. It is significantly utilized in traffic management and road safety using cloud applications. To obtain impressive networking in vehicular communication, there is a need of hybrid technological approach in the form of VCC utilizing vehicular resources, cloud infrastructure, and Internet of Things (IoT) environment. VCC presents smart vehicular communication structure and maintains autonomous traffic, improved vehicle control, and enhanced system security. Security and privacy has appeared to be a major concern in VCC because of involvement of unknown vehicles and infrastructure via public network. In this article, we propose a biometric and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)-assisted authentication framework for VCC. The presented framework obtains most of security features and attributes for secure communication in the presence of active and passive attackers. Further, we provide formal security model and its proof, which is based on random oracle model. We compare the performance of our protocol with similar frameworks in the same environment. Our analysis indicates that the presented framework is secure and efficient in terms of communication and computation overheads. As a result, the presented protocol can be utilized in VCC.

AB The trajectory tracking issue of unmanned vehicles has attracted much attention recently, with the rapid development and implementation of sensing, communication, and computing technologies. This paper proposes a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) for the trajectory tracking application of an unmanned vehicle (UV). First, a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) kinematics model of this UV is used to derive the desirable controller with two control variables as forward velocity and yaw angle. Next, the one-step Euler method is employed to establish the nonlinear prediction model, then a nonlinear optimization objective function is formulated to minimize the tracking errors of forward velocity and yaw angle from a preset time-varying reference road. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed NMPC scheme is assessed under two different driving scenarios via MATLAB simulations. The simulation results confirm that the proposed NMPC scheme reveals better control accuracy and computational efficiency than the standard MPC controller under two different prescribed roads. Moreover, an outdoor field test is conducted to verify the performance of the proposed NMPC scheme, and the results show that the proposed NMPC can be applied to the real vehicle and can improve the tracking accuracy and the driving stability of trajectory tracking.

AB This paper presents a complete framework for reactive and flexible autonomous vehicle navigation. A human driver reactively guides a vehicle to the final destination while performing a smooth trajectory and respecting the road boundaries. The objective of this paper is to achieve similar behavior in an unmanned ground vehicle to reach a static or dynamic target location. This is achieved by using a flexible control law based on a novel definition of control variables and Lyapunov synthesis. Furthermore, a target assignment strategy to enable vehicle navigation through successive waypoints in the environment is presented. An elementary waypoint selection method is also presented to perform safe and smooth trajectories. The asymptotic stability of the proposed control strategy is proved. In addition, an accurate estimation of the maximum error boundary, according to the controller parameters, is given. With this indicator, the vehicle navigation will be safe within a certain boundaries. Simulations and experiments are performed in different cases to demonstrate the flexibility, reliability and efficiency of the control strategy. Our proposal is compared with different navigation methods from the literature such as those based on trajectory following. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Velocity planning on a path to be followed by a wheeled autonomous vehicle may be difficult when high curvatures and velocities are allowed. A fast, straightforward algorithm to address this problem is presented. It has linear-time computational complexity and provides an optimal minimum-time velocity profile. The algorithm is based on a curvilinear discretization that makes easy to take into account the constraint on the vehicle's maximal normal acceleration. A generalized problem is also addressed with formal results on feasibility, complexity, and solution characterization. Three examples illustrate the proposed approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper considers the design and stability analysis of a steering controller, The objective of the controller is to steer a ground vehicle along a reference line located in the middle of the lane to be followed, We define an arbitrary look-ahead point located on the local longitudinal axis of the vehicle, The distance between the look-ahead point and the reference line is called the look-ahead offset, During perfect lane tracking, the ratio of the steer angle to the look-ahead offset is independent of the curve radius under reasonable approximations, That ratio is computed in terms of the vehicle speed and various vehicle parameters, Then, a constant controller is designed to achieve that ratio at steady state, The controller is a continuous function of the vehicle speed. The only information processed by the controller is the look-ahead offset, which can be measured using a radar-based or a vision-based sensor, Using Routh-Hurwitz analysis, we analytically prove that the closed-loop system is stable, Given any range of longitudinal speeds, there exists a sufficiently large look-ahead distance ensuring the closed-loop stability for all speeds in that speed range, For a particular set of parameter variations, it is also shown that choosing the look-ahead distance large enough guarantees the robustness of closed-loop stability, Various simulation results demonstrating the performance of the controller are included.

AB The study of water quality in reservoirs, lakes, and coasts is an activity that mainly uses human-crewed marine vehicles to obtain site parameters such as temperature, conductivity, salinity, pH, and others. This task is facilitated by unmanned vehicles, which improve data quality in hazardous areas and minimize human exposure. This work presents a novel methodology based on systems engineering concepts and hybrid control architecture for a catamaran-class unmanned surface vehicle (USV) named EDSON-J, for remote water quality monitoring activities with payload instrumentation. Critical aspects of the project development are considered, such as requirements, risk management, design flexibility, logical decomposition, functional classification, verification, integration and validation, and technological plan. The applied methodology proposes the main components for the vehicle, a main computer running robotic operating system (ROS) with deliberative control architecture for high-level tasks and a secondary computer running finite state machine (FSM) with hierarchical control architecture for low-level tasks, executing control and navigation algorithms. The results are given through missions of water quality monitoring, attaching a multiparameter payload sonde. Manual and automatic mode controls are suitable for circular and zig-zag maneuvers and show better performance for the proposed platform, guaranteeing the specifications and requirements of the vehicle design and validating the proposed hybrid control architecture.

AB In order to solve the "minimum trap" of Artificial Potential Field and the limitation of traditional path planning algorithm in dynamic obstacle environment, a path planning algorithm based on improved artificial potential field is proposed. Firstly, a virtual potential field detection circle model (VPFDCM) with adjustable radius is proposed to detect the "minimum trap" formed by the repulsion field of obstacles in advance. And the motion model of unmanned vehicle is established. Combined with the improved reinforcement learning algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM), the radius of virtual potential field detection circle is adjusted to achieve effective avoidance of dynamic obstacles. The reliable online collision free path planning of unmanned vehicle in semi closed dynamic obstacle environment is realized. Finally, the reliability and robustness of the algorithm are verified by MATLAB simulation. The simulation results show that the improved artificial potential field can effectively solve the problem of unmanned vehicle falling into the "minimum trap" and improve the reliability of unmanned vehicle movement. Compared with the traditional artificial potential field method, the improved artificial potential field method can achieve more than 90% success rate in obstacle avoidance.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a promising technology for numerous applications involving aerial networks. However, the UAV-RIS concept faces challenges related to the deployment of the UAV-RIS, especially in cases, where UAV-RIS is combined with emerging technologies, such as beamforming, sensitive to propagation channel variation. In this article, we first overview various use-cases of UAV-RIS beam-forming considering practical scenarios. Aiming to improve the performance of communication channels, we propose a machine learning-based beamforming policy for UAV-RIS by employing prioritized experience replay (PER) based deep Q-Network (DQN). Compared to traditional approaches, the proposed PER DQN-based beamforming for UAV-RIS communication provides significant enhancements in performance. Finally, we highlight some potential directions for future research.

AB Non-orthogonal unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided secure downlink transmissions are investigated. A single-antenna UAV serves multiple ground users in the face of multiple colluding eavesdroppers (EVs) and only imperfect location information of the EVs is available. Specially, a power splitting based secure non-orthogonal downlink transmission scheme is considered, where the transmit power is divided into two parts for transmitting confidential information and artificial noise. Explicitly, we maximize the minimum average secrecy rate among all the users by optimizing the UAV trajectory, the transmit power and the power splitting ratio. In order to tackle this non-convex optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm based on the block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm.

AB An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) can only carry limited energy for improved flexibility, but this brings the problem of working endurance. The acquisition of environmental energy by an underwater robot is a positive way to supplement energy and increase endurance. However, the instability and difference in power output capacity of different environmental energies will lead to low utilization of environmental energy. In this study, a multi-energy acquisition model is established to manage the AUV's energy, which includes a heart rate sampling system, a mixed-energy circuit topology, and a maximum power output algorithm of environmental energy based on power trajectory tracking. The simulating results show that the power output control strategy can effectively improve the multi-energy acquisition and utilization efficiency of underwater vehicles, which has a positive significance and could improve endurance time.

AB Particle Filters (PFs) have been successfully employed for monocular 3D model-based tracking of rigid objects. However, these filters depend on the computation of importance weighs that use sub-optimal approximations to the likelihood function. In this paper, we propose to enrich the filter with additional refinement steps to abridge its sub-optimality. We test the proposed approach in two different types of PFs: (i) an Unscented Particle Filter (UPF), and (ii) the recently proposed Unscented Bingham Filter (UBiF). These filters are applied to the outdoor tracking of a fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) autonomous landing in a Fast Patrol Boat (FPB), tested in a simulated environment with a real sky gradient filled with clouds. The use of the refinement steps significantly improves the overall accuracy of the method.

AB Energy consumption estimation and management of the maritime Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) is an important issue to deal with energy minimization techniques such as path planning, tasks scheduling, etc. In this paper, we introduce the energy consumption parameter in USV simulation through three contributions: 1) An analytic USV' s energy consumption model is developed based on the three-degrees-of-freedom dynamic model of surface vessels. 2) A reverse engineering approach is proposed to identify the previously used dynamic model parameters based on a set of scenarios executed within a recent simulation environment. 3) The simulator engine is enriched with the consumption modelling tools such that the power absorbed by the USV is instantaneously calculated and returned; thus, the required energy of any predefined scenario is available as a new simulation result.

AB Since 1997, when the first hybrid vehicle was launched on the market, until today, the number of NIMH batteries that have been discarded due to their obsolescence has not stopped increasing, with an even faster rate more recently due to the progressive disappearance of thermal vehicles on the market. The battery technologies used are mostly NIMH for hybrid vehicles and Li ion for pure electric vehicles, making recycling difficult due to the hazardous materials they contain. For this reason, and with the aim of extending the life of the batteries, even including a second life within electric vehicle applications, this paper describes and evaluates a low-cost system to characterize individual cells of commercial electric vehicle batteries by identifying such abnormally performing cells that are out of use, minimizing regeneration costs in a more sustainable manner. A platform based on the IoT technology is developed, allowing the automation of charging and discharging cycles of each independent cell according to some parameters given by the user, and monitoring the real-time data of such battery cells. A case study based on a commercial Toyota Prius battery is also included in the paper. The results show the suitability of the proposed solution as an alternative way to characterize individual cells for subsequent electric vehicle applications, decreasing operating costs and providing an autonomous, flexible, and reliable system.

ID BELIEF PROPAGATION
AB This paper presents a strategy to cooperatively enhance the vehicular localization in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks by exchanges and updates of local data in a consensus-based manner. Where each vehicle in the network can obtain its location estimate despite its possible inaccuracy, the proposed strategy takes advantage of the abundance of the local estimates to improve the overall accuracy. During the execution of the strategy, vehicles exchange each other's inter-vehicular relationship pertaining to measured distances and angles in order to update their own estimates. The iteration of the update rules leads to averaging out the measurement errors within the network, resulting in all vehicles' localization error to retain similar magnitudes and orientations with respect to the ground truth locations. Furthermore, the estimate error of the anchor-the vehicle with the most reliable localization performance-is temporarily aggravated through the iteration. Such circumstances are exploited to simultaneously counteract the estimate errors and effectively improve the localization performance. Simulated experiments are conducted in order to observe the nature and its effects of the operations. The outcomes of the experiments and analysis of the protocol suggest that the presented technique successfully enhances the localization performances, while making additional insights regarding performance according to environmental changes and different implementation techniques.

AB This letter addresses the moving path following (MPF) motion control problem that consists of steering a robotic vehicle along a specified geometric path expressed with respect to a moving target frame. External disturbances that depend on the operational environment such as maritime currents, wind, or rough terrain can affect the vehicle motion in a variety of ways. Furthermore, imperfections and simplifications of the vehicle model can also lead to unknown disturbances. One way to overcome this problem is by designing robust controllers to perform the task. Existing literature on MPF control does not consider these disturbances and further assume that the linear and angular velocity of the target frame is known. In this letter, these assumptions are relaxed through the design of robust MPF control schemes. To this end, two robust control strategies are proposed to solve the MPF control problem for a robotic vehicle with actuation constraints and bounded disturbances. Using Lyapunov-based arguments, both controllers are proven to be globally asymptotically stable with respect to the origin of the MPF error. Experimental results using autonomous underwater vehicles demonstrate the viability of the proposed control schemes for applications in a real world environment.

TI Who Should Bear the Risk When Self-Driving Vehicles Crash?
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHILOSOPHY

DT Article
ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; TROLLEY; ETHICS
AB The moral importance of liability to harm has so far been ignored in the lively debate about what self-driving vehicles should be programmed to do when an accident is inevitable. But as discussions in the context of self-defense have highlighted, liability matters a great deal to just distribution of risk of harm. While it is sometimes morally required simply to minimize the risk of relevant harms, this is not so when one party is responsible for creating the risky situation, which is common in real-world traffic scenarios. In particular, insofar as possible, those who have voluntarily engaged in activity that foreseeably poses the risk of harm should be the ones who bear it, other things being equal. This should not be controversial when someone intentionally or recklessly creates a risky situation. But I argue that on plausible assumptions, merely choosing to use a self-driving vehicle typically gives rise to a degree of liability, so that such vehicles should be programmed to shift the larger share of the risk from innocent outsiders to users by default. Insofar as automated vehicles cannot be programmed to take all the factors affecting liability into account, there is a pro tanto moral reason to restrict their use.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is a vision for an intemetwork of intelligent, communicating objects, which is on the cusp of transforming human lives. Smart transportation is one of the critical application domains of IoT and has benefitted from using state-of-the-art technology to combat urban issues such as traffic congestion while promoting communication between the vehicles, increasing driver safety, traffic efficiency and ultimately paving the way for autonomous vehicles. Connected Vehicle (CV) technology, enabled by Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC), has attracted significant attention from industry, academia, and government, due to its potential for improving driver comfort and safety. These vehicular communications have stringent transmission requirements. To assure the effectiveness and reliability of DRSC, efficient algorithms are needed to ensure adequate quality of service in the event of network congestion. Previously proposed congestion control methods that require high levels of cooperation among Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) nodes. This paper proposes a new approach, VANETomo, which uses statistical Network Tomography (NT) to infer transmission delays on links between vehicles with no cooperation from connected nodes. Our proposed method combines open and closed loops congestion control in a VANET environment. Simulation results show VANETomo outperforming other congestion control strategies.

AB LiDAR sensors are needed for use in vehicular applications, particularly due to their good behavior in low-light environments, as they represent a possible solution for the safety systems of vehicles that have a long braking distance, such as trams. The testing of long-range LiDAR dynamic responses is very important for vehicle applications because of the presence of difficult operation conditions, such as different weather conditions or fake targets between the sensor and the tracked vehicle. The goal of the authors in this paper was to develop an experimental model for indoor testing, using a scaled vehicle that can measure the distances and the speeds relative to a fixed or a moving obstacle. This model, containing a LiDAR sensor, was developed to operate at variable speeds, at which the software functions were validated by repeated tests. Once the software procedures are validated, they can be applied on the full-scale model. The findings of this research include the validation of the frontal distance and relative speed measurement methodology, in addition to the validation of the independence of the measurements to the color of the obstacle and to the ambient light.

ID DRIVER TRUST
AB Various collision avoidance systems (CASs) have been developed and employed in human-operated vehicles as well as more recently in autonomous vehicles. Most of the existing CASs perform an override function to actuate automatic emergency braking in a critical situation based on the current traffic information obtained from in-vehicle sensors or short-range vehicular communications. These CASs focus on the critical situation in the vicinity of the subject vehicle, which means they may have negative influences on the subject vehicle and its following vehicles, particularly when the leader vehicle of a platoon with short headway applies harsh braking to mitigate an impending collision risk. This study proposes a risk predictive CAS (RPCAS) which executes predictive deceleration with mild braking in advance to prevent a potential rear-end collision by predicting the collision risk arising from a downstream site. To evaluate the performance of the RPCAS, the proposed system is compared with several existing CASs in various car-following cases based on a microscopic traffic simulation. The simulation results show that the RPCAS can effectively reduce the rear-end collision risk with less harsh braking compared with the existing CASs. Furthermore, the RPCAS enables vehicles arriving from upstream to anticipate a potential crash, which provides them with sufficient time to reduce their current speeds proactively. The research findings suggest that the proposed system can attenuate the negative impacts of the previous CASs in relation to traffic and vehicular safety.

AB The semantic segmentation of road scenes is an important task in autonomous driving. Deep learning has enabled the development of a variety of semantic segmentation networks using RGB and depth data. However, poor lighting conditions and long-distance sensing limit the applicability of RGB and depth cameras. Nevertheless, many existing methods still rely on precise depth maps for scene segmentation. Unlike depth information, thermal imaging provides a visual heat representation that remains accurate under a variety of lighting conditions and over longer distances. For robust and accurate segmentation of scenes collected during autonomous driving, we used the advanced MobileNetV2 network for feature extraction and a fusion strategy with an embedded control gate. In addition, we adopted an encoder-decoder scheme for semantic segmentation and developed an attention residual learning strategy to restore the resolution of the feature map. Finally, semantic and boundary supervision is introduced to optimize parameters of the proposed network. Experimental results show that the proposed network outperforms existing networks on segmentation of urban scenes, and our network can be generalized to depth data.

AB The weigh-in-motion (WIM) system is a necessary piece of equipment for an intelligent road. It can provide real-time vehicle weight and lateral distribution data on wheel load to effectively support pavement structure design and service life analysis for autonomous driving. This paper proposed an enhanced weigh-in-motion sensors system using Fabry-Perot (F-P) cavity fiber optical technology. Laboratory testing was performed to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed system and field application was conducted as well. The laboratory results show that the traffic loads could be obtained by measuring the center wavelength changes in the embedded F-P Cavity tunable filter. The laboratory results also show that the vehicle load and the number of vehicle axles can be estimated based on the system transfer function between the dynamic loading and the wavelength variation. The field application indicates that the weighting accuracy of the proposed system could reach 94.46% for moving vehicles, and the vehicle passing speed is the potentially relevant factor. The proposed system also has the ability to estimate the number of vehicle axles and the loading position, and the precision could reach 97.1% and 300 mm, respectively.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) promise to change the transportation landscape with safer, faster and more energy-efficient mobility. However 100% CAV penetration may never be achieved, raising the question of how to ensure a productive co-existence of CAVs with conventional vehicles. In this paper, we address the problem of optimally controlling CAVs under mixed traffic conditions where both CAV5 and human-driven vehicles (non-CAVs) travel on the roads. We specifically consider problems with such mixed traffic crossing an intersection without using explicit traffic signaling, the objective being to minimize energy consumption subject to a throughput maximization requirement while guaranteeing safety constraints. The impact of CAVs on overall energy consumption is investigated under different traffic scenarios as a function of the CAV penetration rate (i.e., the fraction of CAVs relative to all vehicles). Performance under traffic light control is used as a baseline for this study. Results are validated through simulation using MATLAB and VISSIM. The results indicate that the energy efficiency improvement becomes more significant as the CAV penetration rate increases, while the significance diminishes as traffic becomes heavier.

DE LTE-V2V; Geo-based resource selection; Vehicle trajectory prediction
AB Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communication has recently been considered in 4G and 5G cellular networks. One of the challenging issues in cellular V2V is allocating radio resources to the vehicles. Although previous work have addressed this issue, the fast varying nature of vehicular traffic and its regularities implies that the mobility of the vehicles should be more attended. To this goal, we propose an autonomous geo-based resource selection algorithm that uses deep learning to predict vehicle locations in the future and alleviate the computation and signalling overhead of the cellular infrastructure in contrast to previous geo-based resource allocation algorithms. We utilize the current and the future of vehicle densities in a formulated matching problem to find the optimum assignment of sub-resource pools to geographic areas. Simulation results of a highway with diverse density scenarios and different number of available resources show that the proposed method guarantees a considerable reduction in computation and signalling overhead while in low awareness ranges, it provides up to 10% improvement in Packet Reception Ratio (PRR) and the error rate of vehicles compared to the previous Dynamic Geo-based Resource Selection Algorithm (DGRSA). The proposed method also provides up to 15% improvement in PRR and error rate compared to the modified DGRSA, which we have changed to run with an overhead equal to the overhead of our proposed method. Furthermore, our results demonstrate up to 67% and 76% improvement in blocking rate compared to DGRSA and modified DGRSA, respectively.

AB The horizontal curvature and a driver's behavior on curved roads significantly affect vehicle fuel economy. This paper describes how optimal speed profiles can minimize fuel consumption for a vehicle travelling on a curve. Previous studies suggested that sustaining a constant speed throughout a level road is the optimal measure for conserving fuel, within certain bounds. Based on the established vehicle dynamic model and an instantaneous fuel consumption model, the optimal constant speeds corresponding to circular curves with different radii can be derived. When entering or departing a curve for additional study, a dynamic programming algorithm is tailored to obtain the optimal speed profile in the vicinity of the curve. The algorithm is verified by using co-simulation of CarSim and Matlab/Simulink, and the results show the algorithm can save approximately 5.46% to 17.64% of fuel compared with the deceleration and acceleration modes of typical driver model controlled by a proportional integral controller. This technology can not only improve the conventional vehicle fuel economy by taking into account the horizontal curvature but also provide decision-making reference for the autonomous vehicle speed control.

ID PERFORMANCE; SYSTEM
AB This paper reports the development and experimental evaluation of two in situ least squares techniques for estimating the alignment matrix of Doppler sonars commonly used for precision navigation of oceanographic submersibles. Most previously reported methods addressed the problem of single degree-of-freedom heading alignment using bottom-lock Doppler sonar data and global positioning system (GPS) navigation data. This paper reports and evaluates two techniques for three degree-of-freedom calibration of attitude and Doppler sonar sensors using sensor data available to vehicles at full ocean depth. The first technique provides a general linear least squares estimate of the alignment matrix. The second technique results in a least squares alignment matrix estimate constrained to the group of rotation matrices. The performance of these estimates is evaluated with a laboratory remotely operated vehicle (ROV) and a field-deployed autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Experimental results are reported which demonstrate that Doppler navigation employing the reported alignment calibration techniques significantly improves navigation precision. The experiments show that the latter technique provides calibration estimates that improve Doppler navigation precision not only on the calibration data set itself, but also provide improved precision over a wide variety of vehicle trajectories other than the calibration data set.

AB This paper presents a visual-based approach that allows an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to detect and track a cooperative flying vehicle autonomously using a monocular camera. The algorithms are based on template matching and morphological filtering, thus being able to operate within a wide range of relative distances (i.e., from a few meters up to several tens of meters), while ensuring robustness against variations of illumination conditions, target scale and background. Furthermore, the image processing chain takes full advantage of navigation hints (i.e., relative positioning and own-ship attitude estimates) to improve the computational efficiency and optimize the trade-off between correct detections, false alarms and missed detections. Clearly, the required exchange of information is enabled by the cooperative nature of the formation through a reliable inter-vehicle data-link. Performance assessment is carried out by exploiting flight data collected during an ad hoc experimental campaign. The proposed approach is a key building block of cooperative architectures designed to improve UAV navigation performance either under nominal GNSS coverage or in GNSS-challenging environments.

AB In this paper, a new methodology for computing optimised obstacle avoidance steering manoeuvres for ground vehicles is presented and discussed. Most of the existing methods formulate the obstacle avoidance problem as an optimal control problem which is hard to solve or as a numerical optimisation problem with a large number of unknowns. This method is based on a reformulation of Pontryagin's Maximum Principle and leads to the solution of an adjustable time optimal controller. The control input is significantly simplified and permits its application in a sample and hold sense. Furthermore, with the proposed approach the maximum tyre forces exerted during the manoeuvre are minimised. In this study, it is shown how to warm start' the proposed algorithm and which constraints to relax'. Numerical examples and benchmark tests illustrate the performance of the proposed controller and compare it with other standard controllers. A sensitivity analysis for different vehicle parameters is performed and finally conclusions are drawn. A significant advantage of the method is the small computational complexity. The overall simplicity of the controller makes it attractive for application on autonomous vehicles.

AB Identifying a reliable path in uncertain environments is essential for designing reliable off-road autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) considering postdesign operations. This article presents a novel bio-inspired approach for model-based multivehicle mission planning under uncertainty for off-road AGVs subjected to mobility reliability constraints in dynamic environments. A physics-based vehicle dynamics simulation model is first employed to predict vehicle mobility (i.e., maximum attainable speed) for any given terrain and soil conditions. Based on physics-based simulations, the vehicle state mobility reliability in operation is then analyzed using an adaptive surrogate modeling method to overcome the computational challenges in mobility reliability analysis by adaptively constructing a surrogate. Subsequently, a bio-inspired approach called Physarum-based algorithm is used in conjunction with a navigation mesh to identify an optimal path satisfying a specific mobility reliability requirement. The developed Physarum-based framework is applied to reliability-based path planning for both a single-vehicle and multiple-vehicle scenarios. A case study is used to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods and algorithms. The results show that the proposed framework can effectively identify optimal paths for both scenarios of single and multiple vehicles. The required computational time is less than the widely used Dijkstra-based method.

TI Network slicing for vehicular communication
SO TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Ultra-reliable vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is essential for enabling the next generation of intelligent vehicles. V2X communication is a growing area of communication that connects vehicles to neighboring vehicles (V2V), infrastructure (V2I), and pedestrians (V2P). Network slicing is one of the promising technologies for connectivity of the next generation devices, creating several logical networks on a common and programmable physical infrastructure. Network slicing offers an efficient way to satisfy the diverse use case requirements by exploiting the benefits of shared physical infrastructure. In this regard, we propose a network slicing-based communication solution for vehicular networks. In this work, we model a highway scenario with vehicles having heterogeneous traffic demands. The autonomous driving slice (safety messages) and the infotainment slice (video stream) are the two logical slices created on a common infrastructure. We formulated a network clustering and slicing algorithm to partition the vehicles into different clusters and allocate slice leaders (SLs) to each cluster. SLs serve its clustered vehicles with high-quality V2V links and forwards safety information with low latency. On the other hand, road side unit provides infotainment service using high-quality V2I links. An extensive Long Term Evolution Advanced system-level simulator with enhancement of cellular V2X standard is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, in which it is shown that the proposed network slicing technique achieves low latency and high-reliability communication.

AB In this work we study the behavior of groups of autonomous vehicles, which are the part of the Internet of Vehicles systems. One of the challenging modes of operation of such systems is the case when the observability of each vehicle is limited and the global/local communication is unstable, e.g. in the crowded parking lots. In such scenarios the vehicles have to rely on the local observations and exhibit cooperative behavior to ensure safe and efficient trips. This type of problems can be abstracted to the so-called multi-agent pathfinding when a group of agents, confined to a graph, have to find collision-free paths to their goals (ideally, minimizing an objective function e.g. travel time). Widely used algorithms for solving this problem rely on the assumption that a central controller exists for which the full state of the environment (i.e. the agents current positions, their targets, configuration of the static obstacles etc.) is known and they cannot be straightforwardly be adapted to the partially-observable setups. To this end, we suggest a novel approach which is based on the decomposition of the problem into the two sub-tasks: reaching the goal and avoiding the collisions. To accomplish each of this task we utilize reinforcement learning methods such as Deep Monte Carlo Tree Search, Q-mixing networks, and policy gradients methods to design the policies that map the agents' observations to actions. Next, we introduce the policy-mixing mechanism to end up with a single hybrid policy that allows each agent to exhibit both types of behavior - the individual one (reaching the goal) and the cooperative one (avoiding the collisions with other agents). We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation that shows that the suggested hybrid-policy outperforms standalone stat-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods for this kind of problems by a notable margin.

AB Electric vehicles (EVs) have recently gained momentum as an integral part of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) when authorities started expanding their low emission zones (LEZs) in an effort to build green cities with low carbon footprints. Energy is one of the key requirements of EVs, not only to support the smooth and sustainable operation of EVs, but also to ensure connectivity between the vehicle and the infrastructure in the critical times such as disaster recovery operation. In this context, renewable energy sources (such as wind energy) have an important role to play in the automobile sector towards designing energy-harvesting electric vehicles (EH-EV) to mitigate energy reliance on the national grid. In this article, a novel approach is presented to harness energy from a small-scale wind turbine due to vehicle mobility to support the communication primitives in electric vehicles which enable plenty of IoV use cases. The harvested power is then processed through a regulation circuitry to consequently achieve the desired power supply for the end load (i.e., battery or super capacitor). The suitable orientation for optimum conversion efficiency is proposed through ANSYS-based aerodynamics analysis. The voltage-induced by the DC generator is 35 V under the no-load condition while it is 25 V at a rated current of 6.9 A at full-load, yielding a supply of 100 W (on constant voltage) at a speed of 90 mph for nominal battery charging.

AB With the use of microscopic traffic simulations, physical features of microscopic traffic prediction for automated driving that should improve traffic harmonization and safety have been found: During a short-time prediction horizon (about 10 s), online prediction of the locations and speeds of all vehicles in some limited area around the automated-driving vehicle is possible; this enables the automated vehicle control in complex traffic situations in which the automated-driving vehicle is not able to make a decision based on current traffic information without the use of the microscopic traffic prediction. Through a more detailed analysis of an unsignalized city intersection, when the automated vehicle wants to turn right from a secondary road onto the priority road, the statistical physics of the effect of a data uncertainty caused by errors in data measurements on the prediction reliability has been studied: (i) probability of the prediction reliability has been found; (ii) there is a critical uncertainty, i.e., a maximum amplitude of errors in data measurements: when the uncertainty does not exceed the critical uncertainty, the prediction reliability probability is equal to 1, otherwise, the prediction is not applicable for a reliable automated vehicle control; (iii) physical characteristics of the microscopic traffic prediction, at which the critical uncertainty can be increased considerably, have been found; and (iv) there is an optimal automated vehicle control at which the critical uncertainty reaches a maximum value.

AB The changes of the seabed environment caused by a natural disaster or human activities dramatically affect the life span of the subsea buried cable. It is essential to track the cable route in order to inspect the condition of the buried cable and protect its surviving seabed environment. The magnetic sensor is instrumental in guiding the remotely-operated vehicle (ROV) to track and inspect the buried cable underseas. In this paper, a novel framework integrating the underwater cable localization method with the magnetic guidance and control algorithm is proposed, in order to enable the automatic cable tracking by a three-degrees-of-freedom (3-DOF) under-actuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) without human beings in the loop. The work relies on the passive magnetic sensing method to localize the subsea cable by using two tri-axial magnetometers, and a new analytic formulation is presented to compute the heading deviation, horizontal offset and buried depth of the cable. With the magnetic localization, the cable tracking and inspection mission is elaborately constructed as a straight-line path following control problem in the horizontal plane. A dedicated magnetic line-of-sight (LOS) guidance is built based on the relative geometric relationship between the vehicle and the cable, and the feedback linearizing technique is adopted to design a simplified cable tracking controller considering the side-slip effects, such that the under-actuated vehicle is able to move towards the subsea cable and then inspect its buried environment, which further guides the environmental protection of the cable by setting prohibited fishing/anchoring zones and increasing the buried depth. Finally, numerical simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed magnetic guidance and control algorithm on the envisioned subsea cable tracking and the potential protection of the seabed environment along the cable route.

AB This paper introduces an autonomous integrated indoor navigation system for ground vehicles that fuses inertial sensors, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors, received signal strength (RSS) observations in wireless local area networks (WLANs), odometry, and predefined occupancy floor maps. This paper proposes a solution for the problem of automatic self-alignment and position initialization indoors under the absence of an absolute navigation system such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). The initial tilt angles (roll and pitch) are estimated by an extended Kalman filter (EKF) that uses two horizontal accelerometers as measurements. The initial position and heading estimation is performed using a subimage matching algorithm based on normalized cross-correlation between projected 2-D LiDAR scans and an occupancy floor map of the environment. The ambiguities in position/heading initialization are resolved using RSS. The proposed position/heading estimation module is also utilized in navigation mode as a source of absolute position/heading updates to EKF for enhanced observability. The state predictor is an enhanced 3-D inertial navigation system that utilizes low-cost microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based reduced inertial sensor set aided by vehicle odometry. In navigation mode, LiDAR scans are used to estimate the vehicle's relative motions using an inertial-aided iterative closest point algorithm. To fuse all available measurements, a multirate multimode EKF design is proposed to correct navigation states and estimate sensor biases. The developed system was tested under a real indoor office environment covered by an IEEE 802.11 WLAN on a mobile robot platform equipped with MEMS inertial sensors, a WLAN interface, a 2-D LiDAR scanner, and a quadrature encoder. Results demonstrated the capabilities of the self-alignment and initialization module and showed average submeter-level positioning accuracy.

AB New mobility transport systems are expected to be autonomously driven. Even if public interest and a priori acceptability of such systems are high, there is only a few studies with people that already experienced an automated mobility system. This paper presents the results of a questionnaire study after experience the automated vehicle in the Tornado project. 155 users tested the vehicle in an itinerary of 6.5 km with an average speed of 25 km/h and a maximum speed of 50 km/h including straight stretches, intersections, traffic lights, roundabouts, narrow roads and a tunnel. Questionnaire content is based on some of the determinants of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) and car technology acceptance models (CTAM) together with an additional determinant introduced to analyze if vehicle performance seems natural. Usefulness, safety and enjoyment of automated vehicles already claimed in other projects are here confirmed even if speed is increased compared to previous projects. The increase in the maximum speed is not directly associated to a reduction on the safety feeling on-board. Answers have also been correlated to demographic characteristics of respondents, confirming some findings in the literature, and adding new ones related to previous autonomous vehicle experience and education level.

AB In this paper, we study how to learn a harmonious deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based lane-changing strategy for autonomous vehicles without Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication support. The basic framework of this paper can be viewed as a multi-agent reinforcement learning in which different agents will exchange their strategies after each round of learning to reach a zero-sum game state. Unlike cooperation driving, harmonious driving only relies on individual vehicles' limited sensing results to balance overall and individual efficiency. Specifically, we propose a well-designed reward that combines individual efficiency with overall efficiency for harmony, instead of only emphasizing individual interests like competitive strategy. Testing results show that competitive strategy often leads to selfish lane change behaviors, anarchy of crowd, and thus the degeneration of traffic efficiency. In contrast, the proposed harmonious strategy can promote traffic efficiency in both free flow and traffic jam than the competitive strategy. This interesting finding indicates that we should take care of the reward setting for reinforcement learning-based AI robots (e.g., automated vehicles) design, when the utilities of these robots are not strictly in alignment.

AB The ARTEMIS docking system demonstrates autonomous docking capability applicable to robotic exploration of sub-ice oceans and sub-glacial lakes on planetary bodies, as well as here on Earth. In these applications, melted or drilled vertical access shafts restrict vehicle geometry as well as the in-water infrastructure that may be deployed. The ability of the vehicle to return reliably and precisely to the access point is critical for data return, battery charging, and/or vehicle recovery. This paper presents the mechanical, sensor, and software components that make up the ARTEMIS docking system, as well as results from field deployment of the system to McMurdo Sound, Antarctica in the austral spring of 2015. The mechanical design of the system allows the vehicle to approach the dock from any direction and to pitch up after docking for recovery through a vertical access shaft. It uses only a small volume of in-water equipment and may be deployed through a narrow vertical access shaft. The software of the system reduces position estimation error with a hierarchical combination of dead reckoning, acoustic aiding, and machine vision. The system provides critical operational robustness, enabling the vehicle to return autonomously and precisely to the access shaft and latch to the dock with no operator input.

DT Article
AB The X-34, being designed and built by the Orbital Sciences Corporation, is an unmanned suborbital vehicle designed to be used as a flying test bed to demonstrate key vehicle and operational technologies applicable to future reusable launch vehicles. The X-34 will be air-launched from an L-1011 carrier aircraft, where an onboard engine will then accelerate the vehicle to speeds above Mach 7 and altitudes to 250,000 ft. An unpowered entry will follow, including an autonomous landing. A series of wind-tunnel tests on scaled models was conducted in four facilities at the NASA Langley Research Center to determine the aerodynamic characteristics of the X-34. Analysis of these test results revealed that longitudinal trim could be achieved throughout the design trajectory. Longitudinal control effectiveness (elevon, body flap) decreased for Mach numbers greater than one and was nonlinear in the transonic regime. In addition, there was a loss in eleven effectiveness for the largest negative deflection. The rudder effectiveness (of the all-moving vertical tail) decreased for supersonic Mach numbers and with increasing angle of attack, so that at combined high supersonic Mach numbers and high angles of attack the use of reaction control jets may be required. Deployment of the landing gear reduced the eleven effectiveness by 5% and destabilized the vehicle directionally.

ID ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; TUNING STRATEGY
AB Car-following control is a fundamental application of autonomous driving. This control has multiple objectives, including tracking a safe distance to a preceding vehicle and enhancing driving comfort. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful method due to its intuitiveness and capability to cover multiple objectives. MPC determines the relative importance of objectives through a set of weight factors, depending on which, the controller's behavior changes even if the traffic situations are the same. However, determining the optimal weight is not a trivial problem because there is no benchmark to evaluate the performance of the weight, and searching for weight factors with repeated driving experiments is time-consuming. To solve this problem, we proposed an automatic tuning method to determine the weights of the MPC based on personal driving data. Personal driving data under naturalistic driving conditions provide car-following situations and driver's behaviors. These data can generate a reference model to represent the driver's driving style. Based on this model, the proposed method defined the automatic tuning problem as an optimization problem that minimizes the difference between the reference and the controller's response using the optimal weight factors. This optimization problem was solved using the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The proposed method was implemented with an embedded optimization coder in an offline fashion. Its performance was evaluated using personal driving data. From this, the proposed method can reduce the effort and time required for an engineer to find the optimal weight factors.

AB This article is the first in the literature to investigate the network traffic equilibrium for traveling and parking with autonomous vehicles (AVs) under a fully automated traffic environment. Given that AVs can drop off the travelers at their destinations and then drive to the parking spaces by themselves, we introduce the joint equilibrium of AV route choice and parking location choice, and develop a variational inequality (VI)-based formulation for the proposed equilibrium. We prove the equivalence between the proposed VI model and the defined equilibrium conditions. We also show that the link flow solution at equilibrium is unique, even though both the route choices and parking choices are endogenous when human-occupied AV trips (from origin to destination) and empty AV trips (from destination to parking) are interacting with each other on the same network. We then develop a solution methodology based on the parking-route choice structure, where we adjust parking choices in the upper level and route choices in the lower level. Numerical analysis is conducted to explore insights from the introduced modeling framework for AV network equilibrium. The results reveal the significant difference in network equilibrium flows between the AV and non-AV situations. The results also indicate the sensitivity of the AV traffic pattern to different factors, such as value of time, parking pricing, and supply. The proposed approach provides a critical modeling device for studying the traffic equilibrium under AV behavior patterns, which can be used for the assessment of parking policies and infrastructure development in the future era of AVs.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) can plan and actuate control that explicitly considers performance, system safety, and actuation constraints in a manner more efficient than their human-driven counterparts. In particular, eco-driving is enabled through connected exchange of information from signalized corridors that share their upcoming signal phase and timing (SPaT). This is accomplished in the proposed control approach, which follows first principles to plan a free-flow acceleration-optimal trajectory through green traffic light intervals by Pontryagin's Minimum Principle in a feedback manner. Urban conditions are then imposed from exogeneous traffic comprised of a mixture of human-driven vehicles (HVs) - as well as other CAVs. As such, safe disturbance compensation is achieved by implementing a model predictive controller (MPC) to anticipate and avoid collisions by issuing braking commands as necessary. The control strategy is experimentally vetted through vehicle-in-the-loop (VIL) of a prototype CAV that is embedded into a virtual traffic corridor realized through microsimulation. Up to 36% fuel savings are measured with the proposed control approach over a human-modelled driver, and it was found connectivity in the automation approach improved fuel economy by up to 26% over automation without. Additionally, the passive energy benefits realizable for human drivers when driving behind downstream CAVs are measured, showing up to 22% fuel savings in a HV when driving behind a small penetration of connectivity-enabled automated vehicles.

On the other hand, the majority of these algorithms ignore the uncertainties and delays of communication and overlook new cyberattack vectors that are opened by connected traffic. The present study employs a highly detailed simulation of vehicular communication to highlight the sensitivity of different autonomous intersection control algorithms (both centralized and decentralized) to communication-related imperfections. The paper investigates five different algorithms borrowed from the literature in a comparative way. This research focuses on traffic-related parameters such as average speed, occupancy, and network throughput while also analyzing communication-related parameters (e.g., packet loss, computational demand) and considering possible attack vectors. Simulation results suggest that even the simplest control logic is sensitive to communication failures, degrading intersection throughput below traditional intersection control or even compromising traffic safety. For centralized algorithms, in the presence of noise, average speeds drop significantly, suggesting reduced intersection throughput and even gridlock for the First Come First Serve algorithm. Decentralized algorithms can be heavily affected by incoming message orders, which can lead to dangerous situations. During the simulations, multiple collisions were registered for the Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm. More complex algorithms that rely on accurate prediction on vehicle trajectories are more sensitive to noise and even produce accidents in the simulation. In conclusion, regardless of control architecture, the evaluated algorithms require additional fallback solutions and redundancies to retain traffic safety. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operate in the three-dimensional and time-dependent marine environ-ment with strong and dynamic currents. Our goal is to predict the time history of the optimal three-dimensional headings of these vehicles such that they reach the given destination location in the least amount of time, starting from a known initial position. We employ the exact differential equations for time-optimal path planning and develop theory and numerical schemes to accurately predict three-dimensional optimal paths for several classes of marine vehicles, respecting their specific propulsion constraints. We further show that the three-dimensional path planning problem can be reduced to a two-dimensional one if the motion of the vehicle is partially known, e.g. if the vertical component of the motion is forced. This reduces the computational cost. We then apply the developed theory in three-dimensional analytically known flow fields to verify the schemes, benchmark the accuracy, and demonstrate capabilities. Finally, we showcase time-optimal path planning in realistic data-assimilative ocean simulations for the Middle Atlantic Bight region, integrating the primitive-equation of the Multidisciplinary Simulation Estimation and Assimilation System (MSEAS) with the three-dimensional path planning equations for three common marine vehicles, namely propelled AUVs (with unrestricted motion), floats (that only propel vertically), and gliders (that often perform sinusoidal yo-yo motions in vertical planes). These results highlight the effects of dynamic three-dimensional multiscale ocean currents on the optimal paths, including the Gulf Stream, shelfbreak front jet, upper-layer jets, eddies, and wind-driven and tidal currents. They also showcase the need to utilize data -assimilative ocean forecasts for planning efficient autonomous missions, from optimal deployment and pick-up, to monitoring and adaptive data collection.

AB The future of autonomous driving is slowly approaching, but there are still many steps to take before it can become a reality. It is crucial to pay attention to road infrastructure, because without it, intelligent vehicles will not be able to operate reliably, and it will never be possible to dispense of driver's control. This paper presents the work carried out for the detection of road markings damage using computer vision techniques. This is a complex task for which there are currently not many papers and large image sets in the literature. This study uses images from the public Road Damage Detection dataset for the D44 defect and also provides 971 new labelled images for Spanish roads. For this purpose, three detectors based on deep learning architectures (Faster RCNN, SDD and EfficientDet) have been used and single-source and mixed-source models have been studied to find the model that best fits the target images. Finally, F1-score values reaching 0.929 and 0.934 have been obtained for Japanese and Spanish images respectively which improve the state-of-the-art results by 25%. It can be concluded that the results of this study are promising, although the collection of many more images will be necessary for the scientific community to continue advancing in the future in this field of research.

AB Fully automated vehicles could have a significant share of the road network traffic in the near future. Several commercial vehicles with full-range Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems or semi-autonomous functionalities are already available on the market. Many research studies aim at leveraging the potential of automated driving in order to improve the fuel efficiency of vehicles. However, in the vast majority of those, fuel efficiency is isolated to the driving dynamics between a single follower-leader pair, hence overlooking the complex nature of traffic. Consequently fuel efficiency and the efficient use of the roadway capacity are framed as conflicting objectives, leading to fuel-economy control models that adopt highly conservative driving styles.
   This formulation of the problem could be seen as a user-optimal approach, where in spite of delivering savings for individual vehicles, there is the side-effect of the deterioration of traffic flow. An important point that is overlooked is that the inefficient use of roadway capacity gives rise to congested traffic and traffic breakdowns, which in return increases energy costs within the system. The optimisation methods used in these studies entail high computational costs and, therefore, impose a strict constraint on the scope of problem.
   In this study, the use of car-following models and the limitation of the search space of optimal strategies to the parameter space of these is proposed. The proposed framework enables performing much more comprehensive optimisations and conducting more extensive tests on the collective impacts of fuel-economy driving strategies. The results show that, as conjectured, a "short-sighted" user-optimal approach is unable to deliver overall fuel efficiency. Conversely, a system-optimal formulation for fuel efficient driving is presented, and it is shown that the objectives of fuel efficiency and traffic flow are in fact not only non-conflicting, but also that they could be viewed as one when the global benefits to the network are considered.

AB Hilly areas necessitate a field road vehicle with high automation to reduce the amount of labor required to transport agricultural products and to increase productivity. In this paper, an adaptive integrated navigation method (combining global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and inertial navigation system (INS)) and path tracking control strategy of field road vehicles are studied in view of the problems of frequent GNSS outages and high automatic control precision requirement in hilly areas. An indirect Kalman filter (KF) is designed for the GNSS/INS information fusion. A modified method for calculating the KF adaptive factor is proposed to effectively suppress the divergence of the KF and a threshold judgement method to abandon the abnormal GNSS measurement is proposed to deal with GNSS interruptions. To achieve automated driving, a five-layer fuzzy neural network controller, which takes the lateral deviation, heading deviation, and path curvature as input and the steering angle as output, is proposed to control vehicle autonomous tracking of the navigation trajectory accurately. The proposed system was evaluated through simulation and experimental tests on a field road. The simulation results showed that the adjusted KF fusion algorithm can effectively reduce the deviation of a single GNSS measurement and improve the overall accuracy. The test results showed the maximum deviation of the actual travel trajectory from the expected trajectory of the vehicle in the horizontal direction was 12.2 cm and the average deviation was 5.3 cm. During GNSS outages due to obstacles, the maximum deviation in the horizontal direction was 12.7 cm and the average deviation was 6.1 cm. The results show that the designed GNSS/INS integrated navigation system and trajectory tracking control strategy can control a vehicle automatically while driving along a field road in a hilly area.

AB With recent advancements in the automotive world and the introduction of autonomous vehicles, automotive security has become a real and important issue. Modern vehicles have tens of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) connected to in-vehicle networks. As a de facto standard for in-vehicle network communication, the Controller Area Network (CAN) has become a target of cyber attacks. Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is considered as an effective approach to secure CAN and detect malicious attacks. Currently, there are two primary approaches used for intrusion detection: rule-based and machine learning-based. Rule-based approach is efficient but limited in the detection accuracy while machine learning-based detection has comparably higher detection accuracy but higher computation cost at the same time. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid IDS that combines the benefits of both rule-based and machine learning-based approaches. More specifically, we use machine learning methods to achieve a high detection rate while keeping the low computational requirement by offsetting the detection with a rule-based component. Our experiments with CAN traces collected from four different vehicle models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed hybrid IDS.

AB We study the simulation of maneuvers with multibody models. We propose a framework based on a hierarchical decomposition of the problem inspired from the work on autonomous vehicles. The result is a system that not only is capable of piloting a vehicle model of arbitrary complexity along a given track, but it is also able to compute the track itself based on given criteria. The ability to generate feasible tracks, i.e. tracks that are compatible with the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle and other maneuver-defining constraints, is of crucial importance when the vehicle is operating close to its performance boundaries.
   A maneuver is here mathematically defined as an optimal control problem. This definition feeds into a planning layer, that determines the vehicle trajectory by solving the optimization problem for a reduced vehicle model. The resulting trajectory feeds into a control layer, that tracks the computed optimal path using a non-linear model predictive formulation and steers the multibody model accordingly. The reduced models used at the planning and tracking levels are adapted, either in a batch mode or online, to optimize the predictive capabilities of planner and tracker.
   The proposed framework is demonstrated on problems related to maneuvering rotorcraft systems. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reports on the use of co-simulation techniques to build prototypes of co-operative autonomous robotic cyber-physical systems. Designing such systems involves a mission-specific planner algorithm, a control algorithm to drive an agent performing its task; and the plant model to simulate the agent dynamics. An application aimed at positioning a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) in a bounded area, exploiting a Voronoi tessellation algorithm developed in this work, is taken as a case study. The paper shows how co-simulation allows testing the complex system at the design phase using models created with different languages and tools. The paper then reports on how the adopted co-simulation platform enables control parameters calibration, by exploiting design space exploration technology. The INTO-CPS co-simulation platform, compliant with the Functional Mock-up Interface standard to exchange dynamic simulation models using various languages, was used in this work. The different software modules were written in Modelica, C, and Python. In particular, the latter was used to implement an original variant of the Voronoi algorithm to tesselate a convex polygonal region, by means of dummy points added at appropriate positions outside the bounding polygon. A key contribution of this case study is that it demonstrates how an accurate simulation of a cooperative drone swarm requires modeling the physical plant together with the high-level coordination algorithm. The coupling of co-simulation and design space exploration has been demonstrated to support control parameter calibration to optimize energy consumption and convergence time to the target positions of the drone swarm. From a practical point of view, this makes it possible to test the ability of the swarm to self-deploy in space in order to achieve optimal detection coverage and allow unmanned aerial vehicles in a swarm to coordinate with each other.

AB Beacon broadcasting is of great importance in improving road safety and avoiding dangerous situations in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). In order to support emerging vehicular applications such as autonomous driving, the reliability of beacon broadcasting becomes an indispensable issue which is also difficult given the highly dynamic topology and vehicle density. For the territories which are not covered with communication infrastructure, controlling and scheduling in a centralized way may not be applicable. Therefore, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) ad hoc communication is promising to address the ubiquitousness coverage concern. In this paper, a distributed network coding-based medium access control protocol (NC-MAC) is proposed to support V2V beacon broadcasting. We combine the preamble-based feedback mechanism, retransmissions, and network coding together to enhance broadcasting reliability. Extensive simulations are given to show the performance gain of NC-MAC protocol compared to the existing 5 G cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) MAC protocol in a wide range of scenarios including highway and urban vehicle traces generated by simulation of urban mobility (SUMO). The results show that the proposed protocol can improve the communication reliability as well as scalability.

AB In this paper, we present an end-to-end framework for precise large-scale mapping with applications in autonomous driving. In special, the problem of mapping complex environments, with features changing from tree-lined streets to urban areas with dense traffic, is studied. The robotic car is equipped with an odometry sensor, a 3D LiDAR Velodyne HDL-32E, a IMU, and a low cost GPS, and the data generated by these sensors are integrated in a pose-based GraphSLAM estimator. A new strategy for identification and correction of odometry data using evolutionary algorithms is presented. This new strategy makes odometry data significantly more consistent with GPS. Loop closures are detected using GPS data, and GICP, a 3D point cloud registration algorithm, is used to estimate the displacement between the different travels over the same region. After path estimation, 3D LiDAR data is used to build an occupancy grid mapping of the environment. A detailed mathematical description of how occupancy evidence can be calculated from the point clouds is given, and a submapping strategy to handle memory limitations is presented as well. The proposed framework is tested in three real world environments with different sizes, and features: a parking lot, a university beltway, and a city neighborhood. In all cases, satisfactory maps were built, with precise loop closures even when the vehicle traveled long distances between them. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Development of applications related to closed-loop control requires either testing on the field or on a realistic simulator, with the latter being more convenient. To ease that need, this work introduces MVSim, a simulator for multiple vehicles or robots capable of running in real time dozens of agents in simple scenarios, or a handful of them in complex scenarios. MVSim employs realistic physicsgrounded friction models for tire-ground interaction, and aims at accurate and GPU-accelerated simulation of most common modern sensors employed in mobile robotics and autonomous vehicle research, such as depth and RGB cameras, or 2D and 3D LiDAR scanners. All depth-related sensors are able to accurately measure distances to 3D models provided by the user to define custom world elements. Efficient simulation is achieved by means of focusing on ground vehicles, which allows the use of a simplified 2D physics engine for body collisions while solving wheel-ground interaction forces separately. The core parts of the system are written in C++ for maximum efficiency, while Python, ROS 1, and ROS 2 wrappers are also offered. A custom publish/subscribe protocol based on ZeroMQ (ZMQ) is defined to allow for multiprocess applications to access or modify a running simulation. This simulator enables and makes easier to do research and development on vehicular dynamics, autonomous navigation algorithms, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) methods. An experimental performance benchmarking is provided against other state-of-the-art simulators showing significant less CPU usage.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB The immunity paradigm has been recently investigated as a potential solution to the problem of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) navigation when external sensor systems and information of opportunity are not available. The effectiveness of specialized immunity cells in memorizing the characteristics of invading antigens, as well as the characteristics of the response of the host organism, or the antibodies, represent the source of inspiration for the development of an on-board intelligent system, an artificial immune system (AIS). The AIS is expected to provide corrections to a simple dead reckoning algorithm, such that autonomous trajectory tracking control of a UAV can be maintained over extended periods of time. Variables that can characterize the dynamic state of the vehicle and can be measured exclusively with on-board sensors are assimilated to the antigens, while the antibodies consist of the adjustments applied to the integration algorithm, such that accurate estimations of vehicle position and velocity are obtained. The AIS is built as a collection of instantaneous values of antigens and corresponding antibodies, referred to as artificial memory cells. The AIS is constructed using data collected under nominal conditions, when all sensors and systems function correctly and vehicle position and velocity are available. Two alternative approaches for building and operating the AIS are implemented and investigated in this paper. One relies on providing corrections to the output and the other to the input of the integration scheme. The AIS for both scenarios have been generated and tested using the West Virginia University unmanned aerial systems simulation environment. Both alternative approaches have been demonstrated to achieve similar performance in terms of significantly improving the vehicle position and velocity estimation algorithm and leading to desirable trajectory tracking and mission completion.

The IDWS includes: visual detection of both generic obstacles and other vehicles, together with their tracking and identification, estimates of time to collision and behavioural modelling of drivers for a variety of scenarios. These application areas are used to show the applicability of neurofuzzy techniques to the wide range of problems required to support an IDWS, and for future fully autonomous vehicles.

AB This paper addresses the problem of determining the maximum allowable speed (V-max) of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) traversing off-road heterogeneous rough/complex terrain. The maximum speed is calculated based on online terrain assessment and the vehicle's characteristics; this speed achieves the high speed navigation without exceeding a predefined allowable range of transmitted force and moments (i.e., moments in the roll and pitch directions) to the vehicle's frame. The proposed system enables UGV's to change their speed autonomously and transit between terrains with different characteristics (e.g., pavement, rocky) safely. This paper proposes a computationally inexpensive approach to process acquired data and assess the terrain roughness. The proposed Roughness Index (RI) is used to represent the terrain roughness on a scale from 0.0 (highly rough to be traversed by a particular vehicle) to 1.0 (perfectly flat/smooth surface). A general vehicle model (workable for any vehicle size and wheel configuration) is presented in this paper. A closed form expression of the maximum allowable vehicle speed is developed. Simulation results obtained on real vehicles (e.g., military tank LEOPARD I) show the effect of increasing the number of wheels to improve the capability of a ground vehicle to traverse rough terrains at high speeds. In addition, the proposed terrain assessment system is a key module in UGVs navigation systems enabling them to be truly autonomous by providing the navigation system with the necessary information for path and speed planning.

AB Autonomous underwater helicopter, referred to as AUH, has high maneuverability in the horizontal plane and stable movement in the vertical direction due to its disc shape. Thus, the AUH demonstrates great advantages when working in scenarios that require high accuracy of horizontal movement, fixed height and depth, operation near the seafloor, and so on. In this paper, we propose a new design for an autonomous underwater helicopter with three thrusters in the vertical direction (three-vertical-thrusters), so it is equipped with fewer thrusters while maintaining maneuverability and motion stability. The three-vertical-thruster AUH not only achieves stable attitude control, but also reduces the number of thrusters, enabling the AUH to save space, reduce drag, and decrease power consumption. The three-vertical-thruster structure is designed first and compared with the existing four-vertical-thrusters type to verify its advantages through dynamic analysis and hydrodynamic simulation. The three-vertical-thruster AUH is then modelled, and a compensation method is proposed for its more complex control. The three-vertical-thruster AUH's controllability and stability are also verified by experiments on the basis of the experimental prototypes.

AB Combining the agility of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAV) with the dexterity of robotic arms leads to a new era of Aerial Robotic Workers (ARW) targeting infrastructure inspection and maintenance tasks. Towards this vision, this work focuses on the autonomous guidance of the aerial end-effector to either reach or keep desired distance from areas/objects of interest. The proposed system: 1) is structured around a real-time object tracker, 2) employs stereo depth perception to extract the target location within the surrounding scene, and finally 3) generates feasible poses for both the arm and the MAV relative to the target. The performance of the proposed scheme is experimentally demonstrated in multiple scenarios of increasing complexity.

ID AWARENESS
AB The current path tracking control method is usually based on the steering wheel angle loop, which often makes the driver lose control of the automatic driving control loop. In order to involve the driver in the automatic driving control loop, and to solve the vehicle path tracking control problem with system robustness and model uncertainty, this paper puts forward a steering torque control method based on model predictive control algorithm. Based on the vehicle model, this method introduces the steering system model and the steering resistance torque model, and calculates the optimal control torque of the vehicle through the real-time vehicle status, so as to make up for the model mismatch, interference and other uncertainties, and ensure the real-time participation of the driver in the automatic driving control loop. To combine the nonlinear vehicle dynamics model with the steering column model, and to take the vehicle state parameters as the feedback variables of the model predictive controller model, then input the solution of the steering superposition control rate into the vehicle model, the design of the steering controller is realized. Finally, to carry out the simulation of lane keeping based on CarSim software and Simulink control model, and the hardware in-the-loop test on the hardware in-the-loop experimental platform of CarSim/LabVIEW-RT. The simulation and test results indicate that the designed torque loop path tracking control method based on model predictive control can help the driver track the target path better.

AB With the rapid development of autonomous and intelligent techniques, vehicles are currently equipped with computation and communication modules for satisfying clients' on-vehicle computing requests. To meet the client's on-vehicle computation requests such as on-vehicle games and self-driving mechanisms, vehicles have to continuously generate computational tasks. However, due to the limited on-vehicle computation capacities, it is barely possible to handle the above requests by the vehicle itself. These requests are then offloaded to special devices such as roadside units or intelligent vehicles. With the fluid feature of the traffic, more requests are generated during the peak hours than at the low hours. Based on the above facts, two significant challenges arise in vehicular edge computing networks: (i) how to accurately determine whether the vehicular networks are in peak or low hours, and (ii) how to effectively offload the generated requests? In this paper, to tackle the above challenges, we investigate the problem of computational requests offloading under different vehicular networking scenarios. To handle the first challenge, we propose the fuzzy inference-based algorithm to identify the situation of the vehicular network (i.e., whether it is in peak hours or low hours). We employ the reinforcement learning-based algorithm for the second challenge to offload the computational requests effectively. Experiments show that our schemes outperform the benchmark by an average of 24.8% regarding resource utilization when satisfying the interests of both service providers and clients.

AB The problems of traditional traffic flow detection and calculation methods include limited traffic scenes, high system costs, and lower efficiency over detecting and calculating. Therefore, in this paper, we presented the updating Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) model as the scanner of heterogeneous traffic flow, which uses various sensors to detect the characteristics of traffic flow in several traffic scenes on the roads. The model contains the hardware platform, software algorithm of CAV, and the analysis of traffic flow detection and simulation by Flow Project, where the driving of vehicles is mainly controlled by Reinforcement Learning (RL). Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model and the corresponding swarm intelligence strategy is evaluated through simulation experiments. The results showed that the traffic flow scanning, tracking, and data recording performed continuously by CAVs are effective. The increase in the penetration rate of CAVs in the overall traffic flow has a significant effect on vehicle detection and identification. In addition, the vehicle occlusion rate is independent of the CAV lane position in all cases. The complete street scanner is a new technology that realizes the perception of the human settlement environment with the help of the Internet of Vehicles based on 5G communications and sensors. Although there are some shortcomings in the experiment, it still provides an experimental reference for the development of smart vehicles.

ID PREDICTION; FRAMEWORK
AB In autonomous vehicles, recognizing different maneuvering behaviors of surrounding vehicles is crucial to reduce traffic risks and achieve safe path planning. Conventional vehicle behavior recognition methods adopt mainly supervised learning methods and assume that many sample labels are available. However, manual sample labeling is often time-consuming and laborious. Also, onboard sensors collecting surrounding vehicle movement information in data streams often cannot process information in real-time. To tackle these problems, we propose a semi-supervised approach using K-nearest neighbor- (K-NN)-based ensemble learning to classify the maneuvering behaviors of surrounding vehicles. The framework is divided into three parts: initial model training, online classification, and online model updating. First, k-means clustering of the maneuvering behavior is performed, cluster features are calculated, and a set of micro-clusters is obtained to establish the initial model. Second, the ensemble K-NN-based learning method is used to classify the incoming instances. Finally, the model is updated online using error-driven representative learning and an exponential decay function. Typical lane-changing and turning maneuvers are used as representatives to verify the performance of the proposed method. The data are provided by a next-generation simulation project. The results show that the proposed model achieves highest average recognition accuracy compared with other benchmark methods for the lane-changing and turning maneuvers shortly after the maneuver begins, even for a small sample size.

AB As innovative technologies such as autonomous driving, over-the-air technology, and vehicle-to-everything are widely applied to intelligent connected vehicles, people can gain a more convenient and safer driving experience. Although the application of these technologies facilitates our lives, they also bring a series of vulnerable interfaces (such as 5G, Bluetooth, and WiFi), which pose a significant security threat to existing in-vehicle networks. To address these threats, researchers have proposed two mainstream schemes, including message authentication and intrusion detection system (IDS), where the scheme of message authentication needs to occupy the limited bandwidth of controller area network (CAN) bus. Furthermore, most IDSs either cannot locate the sender of the attack, fail to detect aperiodic malicious frames, or require prior knowledge of which CAN identifiers (IDs) belong to which electronic control units (ECUs). To address these weaknesses, we propose a practical voltage-based IDS named IdentifierIDS for real in-vehicle networks. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first scheme to detect intrusions by establishing a voltage fingerprint for each ID without the need for prior knowledge. This allows IdentifierIDS to detect both periodic and aperiodic malicious frames without occupying the limited bandwidth of the CAN bus. As a self-learning IDS, it can adapt to different in-vehicle networks without the need for customization for them. Experiments on three real vehicles demonstrate the robustness of our scheme in different in-vehicle networks.

AB Recent advances in Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) technologies have opened up new opportunities to enable safe, efficient, and sustainable transportation systems. However, developing reliable and rapid speed control algorithms in highly dynamic environments with complex inter-vehicle interactions and nonlinear vehicle dynamics is still a daunting task. In this paper, we develop a novel speed control method for CAVs to produce optimal speed profiles that minimize the fuel consumption and avoid idling at signalized intersections. To this end, an optimal control problem is formulated using the information of the upcoming traffic signal to adapt vehicles' speeds to avoid frequent stop-and-go driving patterns. By applying the pseudospectral discretization method and the sequential convex programming method, the computational efficiency is greatly improved, enabling potential real-time on-vehicle applications. In addition, the algorithm is implemented under a model predictive control framework to ensure online control with instant response for collision avoidance and robust vehicle coordination. The proposed algorithm is verified through numerical simulations of three different traffic scenarios. The convergence and accuracy of the proposed approach are demonstrated by comparing with a popular nonlinear solver. Furthermore, the benefit of the proposed method in both traffic mobility and fuel efficiency is validated using the speed profile determined from a traffic following model in a simulation software as the baseline.

AB The agricultural sector is constantly evolving. The rise in the world's population generates an increasingly growing demand for food, resulting in the need for the agroindustry to meet this demand. Tractors are the vehicles that have made a real difference in agriculture's development throughout history, lowering costs in soil tillage and facilitating activities and operations for workers. This study aims to successfully design and build an autonomous, electric agricultural tractor that can autonomously perform recurring tasks in open-field and greenhouse applications. This project is fully part of the new industrial and agronomic revolution, known as Factory 4.0 and Agriculture 4.0. The predetermined functional requirements for the vehicle are its lightweight, accessible price, the easy availability of its spare parts, and its simple, ordinary maintenance. In this first study, the preliminary phases of sizing and conceptual design of the rover are reported before subsequently proceeding to the dynamical analysis. To optimize the design of the various versions of the automated vehicle, it is decided that a standard chassis would be built based on a robot operating inside a greenhouse on soft and flat terrains. The SimScape multi-body environment is used to model the kinematics of the non-back-drivable screw jack mechanism for the hitch-lifting arms. The control unit for the force exerted is designed and analyzed by means of an inverse dynamics simulation to evaluate the force and electric power consumed by the actuators. The results obtained from the analysis are essential for the final design of the autonomous electric tractor.

For privately-owned AVs, such empty repositioning has the potential benefit of avoiding parking costs at their destination. AV owners could have their vehicle drop them off at their destination, then drive elsewhere to park. Although previous studies have considered the congestion effects of AVs repositioning to park at their owner's residence, this study models the choice of parking location when AVs reposition away from the traveler's destination. We model this behavior through a modified static traffic assignment with a logit model for destination choice, in which AV passenger-carrying trips can create a second empty repositioning trip to an alternate parking zone. The traffic assignment is formulated as a variational inequality. Numerical results on the Chicago sketch network show the effects of AV market penetration, fuel costs, and parking fees on the number of repositioning trips, as well as the impacts of repositioning trips on network congestion. Next, we study the problem of adjusting zone-specific parking costs to influence the repositioning behavior. In particular, when zones have asymmetric parking infrastructure costs, optimized parking fees combined with empty repositioning can encourage AVs to park at cheaper locations, thus reducing the land used for parking at zones with high land value. This network design problem is formulated as a bi-level program. Since it is bi-level and non-convex, a genetic algorithm is used to find a good solution. Results on the Sioux Falls test network show that the adjusted parking costs are effective at reducing the congestion caused by empty repositioning and encouraging more optimal parking choices for repositioning AVs.

AB This paper discusses a collaborative air-ground team of autonomous vehicles for exploring and navigating outdoors within an unknown environment. A custom multi-rotor equipped with onboard downward facing stereo cameras flies over an unknown environment capturing imagery and reconstructing a height map of the ground surface online. Together with a simple terrain classifier, this height map is used to detect obstacles and estimate navigation costs for a Clearpath Robotics Jackal. Given a user defined goal, an online exploration algorithm automatically directs the aerial vehicle to expand the frontiers of the map until a path for the ground vehicle from the current position to the goal is discovered. Simultaneously, this algorithm directs the ground vehicle to execute partial paths to make progress towards the goal before a complete path has been discovered. Aside from the trajectory execution and the state estimation for the unmanned ground vehicle and the graphical interface for the operator, the online exploration algorithm and reconstruction all run onboard the UAV by taking advantage of the graphics processing unit (GPU) computing capabilities of the Nvidia TX2 for both stereo calculations and map construction. This paper presents the improvements made to an existing multi-robot system, the mapping and exploration algorithms. Finally, this paper discusses both simulation and hardware experiments conducted to validate the behavior of the exploration algorithm.

AB Many road accidents happen due to the misjudgments and miscalculations of human drivers when overtaking their lead vehicles. Using unaided sight, the human drivers cannot calculate the accurate velocity of lead vehicles that traveling in similar and opposite directions with respect to their vehicles and can work only by approximation. This incapability of human drivers ends in miscalculation of Time-to-Collision (TTC) and causes accidents between ego and lead vehicles, which kill people in road accidents. A novel Intelligent Overtaking Advice System (IOAS) is proposed in this paper to provide advice to human drivers during attempts to overtake. IOAS is developed to predict both accurate velocity of lead vehicles and accurate TTC. The IOAS is powered by a Velocity Network (VNet) and a Time-to-Collision-Network (TTC-Net). The proposed VNet and TTC-Net are well trained with a huge volume of ground truth datasets to provide better accuracy, robustness, and quick response time. The performance of the proposed IOAS is analyzed and it is observed that the proposed VNet and TTC-Net provide 97% and 98% accuracy, respectively. The proposed IOAS can be integrated into real vehicles as an add-on to the Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) to prevent accidents during the overtaking process.

AB Automated vehicles navigate through their environment by first planning and subsequently following a safe trajectory. To prove safer than human beings, they must ultimately perform these tasks as well or better than human drivers across a broad range of conditions and in critical situations. We show that a feedforward-feedback control structure incorporating a simple physics-based model can be used to track a path up to the friction limits of the vehicle with performance comparable with a champion amateur race car driver. The key is having the appropriate model. Although physics-based models are useful in their transparency and intuition, they require explicit characterization around a single operating point and fail to make use of the wealth of vehicle data generated by autonomous vehicles. To circumvent these limitations, we propose a neural network structure using a sequence of past states and inputs motivated by the physical model. The neural network achieved better performance than the physical model when implemented in the same feedforward-feedback control architecture on an experimental vehicle. More notably, when trained on a combination of data from dry roads and snow, the model was able to make appropriate predictions for the road surface on which the vehicle was traveling without the need for explicit road friction estimation. These findings suggest that the network structure merits further investigation as the basis for model-based control of automated vehicles over their full operating range.

AB The paper presents a distributed hierarchic control design solving a formations problem in three dimension. The agents are modelled as thrust-underactuated rigid bodies. The class of formations addressed encompasses path following of closed convex paths with shape, size, orientation, relative displacements and relative agents' on-path angular positions all seen as formation parameters. This problem can be seen as a generalization of circular formation problems which acquired particular attention in the field of multi-agents, and the agents model used is one that usually models certain unmanned aerial vehicles and other autonomous vehicles. The solution relies on reduction-based set stabilization where the problem is broken down into simpler nested sub-problems. The results illustrate how addressing complex control problems using hierarchical set stabilization is natural, simplifies the solution, and provides useful properties. The results are illustrated via simulations.

AB Advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs) used for pedestrian detection, parking assist, night vision, blind-spot monitoring, collision avoidance, and other such capabilities have significantly enhanced car safety and reduced the risk of dangerous accidents. Their further evolution into a network of intelligent systems using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications is paving the way for autonomous driving. To support these advanced technologies, automotive electronics must be overhauled to enable machine learning capabilities, particularly deep learning, to transform the typical car into a smart system on wheels. Thermal reliability is critical because these high-power, intelligent electronics systems must last more than 10 years under often hostile thermal environments. This article presents an innovative multiphysics solution for thermal, thermal-aware electromigration, and thermal-induced stress analysis of a chip-package-system realized in 3DIC, an example of which is an AI system used in ADAS.

The SoC is able to meet the stringent weight, power, and real-time performance demands of autonomous flight for a bee-sized robot. The entire integrated system with embedded voltage regulation, data conversion, clock generation, as well as both general-purpose and accelerated computing units, weighs less than 3 mg after die thinning. It is self-contained and can be powered directly off of a lithium battery. Measured results show open-loop wing flapping controlled by the SoC and improved energy efficiency through the use of hardware acceleration and supply resilience through the use of adaptive clocking.

Indeed, the fuel cell could be an alternative to the batteries for the electrically powered vehicles but also for other applications demanding autonomous electrical supply. The different types of fuel cells are described with their own performances. The proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) are more specially described. Examples of polymer membranes with their performances are given. The different programs in the EC and in the world are described as well as their applications in different domains such as the electrical powered car.

AB Autonomous driving technology heavily relies on the accurate perception of traffic environments, mainly through roadside cameras and LiDARs. Although several popular and robust 2D and 3D object detection methods exist, including R-CNN, YOLO, SSD, PointPillar, and VoxelNet, the perception range and accuracy of an individual vehicle can be limited by blocking from other vehicles or buildings. A solution is to harness roadside perception infrastructures for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative perception, using edge computing for real-time intermediate features extraction and V2X networks for transmitting these features to vehicles. This emerging migratory perception paradigm requires deploying exclusive cooperative perception services on edge servers and involves the migration of perception services to reduce response time. In such a setup, competition among multiple cooperative perception services exists due to limited edge resources. This study proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based service scheduling method for migratory perception in vehicle-infrastructure cooperative perception, utilizing a discrete time-varying graph to model the relationship between service nodes and edge server nodes. This MADRL-based approach can efficiently address the challenges of service placement and migration in resource-limited environments, minimize latency, and maximize resource utilization for migratory perception services on edge servers.

AB Recent research has developed experimentally verified dynamic models for skid-steered wheeled vehicles and used these results to derive a power model for this important class of all-terrain vehicles. As presented in this paper, based on the torque limitations of the vehicle motors, the dynamic model can be used to develop payload and terrain-dependent minimum turn radius constraints and the power model can be used to predict the energy consumption of a given trajectory. This paper uses these results along with sampling based model predictive optimization to develop an effective methodology for generating dynamically feasible, energy efficient trajectories for skid-steered autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) and compares the resultant trajectories with those based on the standard distance optimal trajectories. The simulated and experimental results consider an AGV moving at a constant forward velocity on both wood and asphalt surfaces under various payloads. The results show that a small increase in the distance of a trajectory over the distance optimal trajectory can result in a dramatic savings in the AGV's energy consumption. They also show that distance optimal planning can often produce trajectories that violate the motor torque constraints for skid-steered AGVs, which can result in poor navigation performance.

AB Autonomous agricultural robots play an essential role in agricultural mechanization. Self-reliable navigation of these robots is a challenging task. Generally, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) based approach, combined with other sensors, is mainly utilized for robot navigation. However, these navigation methods encounter trouble during GNSS signal outages and require a stable navigation solution. This paper proposes a stable navigational algorithm for an orchard robot based on the model-based design that works in a GNSS denied environment. The designed model takes the input driving coordinates and vehicle state from wheel and steering encoders and translates them into vehicle navigational command. The navigation model is built in MATLAB/ Simulink environment. The dynamic behavior of the model is neglected, considering that the robot is a slow -moving vehicle due to its application requirement. For robot navigation, the control command given by the controller is divided into velocity and steering control that follows a defined path at a given velocity and steering rate. The developed system is verified both in real and simulation environments. The control algorithm is verified using a mobile robot (non-holonomic) in an outdoor environment. It is confirmed that the robot is able to navigate satisfactorily in the given environment with normalized root mean square difference error within the range of 0.2-0.4 for steering offset at turning and 0.05 degrees during straight travel. Similarly, the model correlation lies close to 0.99 compared to the steering input angle. The proposed navigational model gives a realistic approach for vehicle navigation with the least sensor interaction.

AB The growth of undersea exploration is pushing both the length and the complexity of propeller-driven autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) missions, leading to more stringent energy requirements. One approach to decrease the energy consumption of a hovering capable AUV is to use variable buoyancy systems (VBS) as a complement to the propeller actuators. These devices only require energy consumption during limited periods of time, taking into advantage the fact that whenever buoyancy is different from zero, the vehicle will continuously ascend or descend. Nevertheless, literature is scarce regarding the choice of the type of the VBS and of its constitutive elements, and regarding their effects on the energy required for buoyancy changes. This work presents structured and detailed static models of electromechanical and electrohydraulic VBSs that allow the calculation of the power required to actuate them. Based on the VBS desired characteristics and on manufacturer's data, the power consumption in each element of the VBS can be pinpointed to determine critical elements. Furthermore, a direct energy comparison with propeller-based solutions can be performed, allowing an easy evaluation of the energy gains provided by the VBS in different scenarios. This work also presents the preliminary development of an electromechanical and electrohydraulic VBS for an existing AUV at the University of Porto, Porto, Portugal. Based on the developed VBS and the developed model, numerical examples are provided for typical mission profiles. It is shown that the use of a VBS in the case of the existing AUV at the University of Porto leads to considerable energetic improvements.

AB Localization is essential for the autonomous navigation of a mobile robot. Because the error of the internal dead-reckoning localization increases with time, the localization error should be corrected periodically using external environmental information. This study presents a practical application of Quick Response (QR) codes to correct the localization error by combining the external QR code information and the internal encoder values. Each QR code contains the information of its own global coordinates and is attached as a one-dimensional array on vertical, thus walls reducing the number of QR codes required for localization. Whenever a QR code is detected and decoded by the mobile robot, the relative transformation between the QR code and the robot can be computed and the pose estimation for the robot is corrected by the extended Kalman filter. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the localization and autonomous navigation of the mobile robot. The influence of the distance between adjacent QR codes in the environment on the localization performance was also addressed and verified by experiments.

AB When automobiles were first introduced in the early 1900s, poor communication and unsafe interactions between drivers and other road users generated resistance. This created a need for new infrastructure, vehicle design, and social norms to mitigate their negative effects on society. Vehicle automation may lead to similar challenges as drivers are supplanted by machines, potentially eliminating social behaviors that serve to smooth on-road communication and coordination. Through a review of communication, robotics, and traffic engineering literature, we explore the mechanisms that allow people to communicate on the road. We show the sensitivity of road users to signals that are sent through vehicle motion, suggesting a need to design vehicle automation kinematics for communication and not just external lighting signals. The framework further points to interdependence in communication where road users modulate their behaviors concurrently to exchange information and develop common ground. Designing automation to support common ground may smooth negotiations by generating interpretable signals in ambiguous situations. We propose a process to make automation observable and directable for other road users by considering vehicle motion during development of algorithms, interfaces, and interactions. Road users will be incidental users of vehicle automation;users whose goals are not directly supported by the technology;and poor communication with them may undermine the safety and acceptance of vehicle automation. As the reach of automation grows, communication among humans and machines may fundamentally change social interactions, requiring a framework to guide the process of making automation interactions smooth and natural.

AB Several problems can be encountered in the design of autonomous vehicles. Their software is organized into three main layers: perception, planning, and actuation. The planning layer deals with the sort and long-term situation prediction, which are crucial for intelligent vehicles. Whatever method is used to make forecasts, vehicles' dynamic environment must be processed for accurate long-term forecasting. In the present article, a method is proposed to preprocess the dynamic environment in a freeway traffic situation. The method uses the structured data of surrounding vehicles and transforms it to an occupancy grid which a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) processes. The grids (2048 pixels) are compressed to a 64-dimensional latent vector by the encoder and reconstructed by the decoder. The output pixel intensities are interpreted as probabilities of the corresponding field is occupied by a vehicle. This method's benefit is to preprocess the structured data of the dynamic environment and represent it in a lower-dimensional vector that can be used in any further tasks built on it. This representation is not handmade or heuristic but extracted from the database patterns in an unsupervised way.

AB Automated vehicles (AVs), the wide adoption of which is expected to improve traffic safety significantly, are penetrating our roads. The AVs that are testing on public roads have been bullied by human road users. We are not sure whether the bullying incidents are isolated or will be common in the future. In a cross-national survey (N = 998 drivers in China and South Korea), we developed an eleven-item bullying intention questionnaire. We assumed and confirmed that, overall, participants had a greater intention to bully machine drivers than to bully other human drivers. Compared to the Korean participants, the Chinese participants reported a greater intention to drive aggressively. The correlations of their intention to bully AVs with their attitude toward AVs and with risk-benefit perception of AVs were weak. Male participants (vs. female participants) and younger participants (vs. older participants) reported a greater intention to drive aggressively. Drivers' aggressive behaviors toward AVs might be common in the future, which might increase traffic risk and hinder the implementation of this technology.

AB In the last few years, robotic technology has been increasingly employed in agriculture to develop intelligent vehicles that can improve productivity and competitiveness. Accurate and robust environmental perception is a critical requirement to address unsolved issues including safe interaction with field workers and animals, obstacle detection in controlled traffic applications, crop row guidance, surveying for variable rate applications, and situation awareness, in general, towards increased process automation. Given the variety of conditions that may be encountered in the field, no single sensor exists that can guarantee reliable results in every scenario. The development of a multi-sensory perception system to increase the ambient awareness of an agricultural vehicle operating in crop fields is the objective of the Ambient Awareness for Autonomous Agricultural Vehicles (QUAD-AV) project. Different onboard sensor technologies, namely stereovision, LIDAR, radar, and thermography, are considered. Novel methods for their combination are proposed to automatically detect obstacles and discem traversable from non-traversable areas. Experimental results, obtained in agricultural contexts, are presented showing the effectiveness of the proposed methods. (C) 2015 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) have played an increasingly significant role in the military and civil fields. The flight control system, as the "hub" of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), is responsible for the key function of autonomous flight, while a reliable and stable navigation system provides important information such as position status for flight control and represents the "sensory" function of the UAV. A highly autonomous and credible UAV requires a navigation system that meets specific requirements for accuracy, integrity, and continuity, resulting in a multitude of sensors on-board the UAV that are heterogeneous, redundant, and multisource, creating a highly complex navigation system. In this article, we review multisensor fusion (MSF) technology for small UAVs over the last 20 years and provide an overview of three typical multisource fusion architectures based on filtering, factor graph optimization, and data-driven, focusing on inductive identification of key technologies for multisource information fusion state estimation systems, including calibration techniques to improve data quality, observability analysis to provide theoretical support, additional model constraint correction using aircraft, and resilient fusion management techniques across all sources. Finally, we propose future directions for UAS navigation systems to address the limitations of the existing systems.

TI Multi-Sensor-Based Fully Autonomous Non-Cooperative Collision Avoidance
   System for Unmanned Air Vehicles
SO JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION

DT Article
ID TRACKING
AB This paper presents a fully autonomous multi-sensor anti-collision system for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. This system is being developed by the Italian Aerospace Research Center in collaboration with the Department of Aerospace Engineering of the University of Naples "Federico II". The research project is entitled TECVOL and is funded in the frame of the National Aerospace Research Program. The system prototype will be initially installed onboard a manned laboratory aircraft equipped for automatic control, therefore flight tests will verify the adequacy of attained performances for supporting fully autonomous flight. The obstacle detection and tracking function is performed by a multi-sensor configuration made up by a pulsed Ka-band radar, two visible (panchromatic and color) video cameras, two infrared video cameras, and two computers. One computer is dedicated to real time sensor fusion and communication with the radar and the flight control computer (by means of a deterministic data bus), the other is devoted to image processing. On the basis of the tracking estimates and of a Collision Avoidance Software, the flight control computer generates and follows in real-time a proper escape trajectory. In order to evaluate the performance of the collision avoidance system, numerical simulations have been performed taking into account the obstacle detection sensors' accuracy, unmanned aircraft's and intruder's flight dynamics, navigation system accuracy and latencies, and collision avoidance logic. The relevant results helped to assess overall system performances and are discussed in depth.

TI YOLO-FA: Type-1 fuzzy attention based YOLO detector for vehicle

SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

AB Vehicle detection is an important component of intelligent transportation systems and autonomous driving. However, in real-world vehicle detection scenarios, the presence of many complex and high uncertainty factors, such as illumination differences, motion blur, occlusion, weather, etc., makes accurate and real-time vehicle detection still challenging. In order to reduce the influence of these uncertainties in real scenarios and improve the accuracy and real-time performance of vehicle detection, this paper proposes a type-1 fuzzy attention (T1FA), in which fuzzy entropy is introduced to re-weight the feature map in order to reduce the uncertainty of the feature map and facilitates the detector's focus on the target center as a way to effectively improve the accuracy of vehicle detection. Furthermore, to detect vehicles with different sizes more effectively, mixed depth convolution in MetaFormer (MDFormer) is employed as a token mixer to capture multi-scale perceptual fields. And a novel YOLO detector based on fuzzy attention (YOLO-FA) is proposed. Experimental results show that T1FA can boost 3.2% AP50 on challenging vehicle detection dataset UA-DETRAC, which is better than other commonly used attention mechanisms, especially in scenarios of rain and nighttime with higher uncertainty by 4.2% and 8.1% AP50, respectively. Finally, without pretraining on extra data, YOLO-FA achieves 70.0% AP50 and 50.3% AP on UA-DETRAC, which achieves better balance between accuracy and speed compared with state-of-the-art detectors. The remarkable improvement of T1FA in different detectors and datasets also shows the considerable generalization of T1FA.

AB The key problems of the steering system and vehicle handling stability of distributed drive electric vehicles are studied in the paper. According to the performance of the distributed drive electric vehicle, a seven-degree-of-freedom is established to match the parameters with the model of CarSim software. Based on the maneuverability improvement control algorithm of the active front wheel system [Active Front Steering (AFS)]/differential power steering system coupling redundancy between differential drive assist steering (DDAS), a AFS/DDAS system coordination control strategy is formulated to reduce the influence of undesirable cross-pendulum moments on vehicle stability. Through the requirements for vehicle stability, a distributed control strategy for the steering stratification of electric vehicles is developed. In the upper layer, the direct transverse moment controller is designed by the linear quadratic regulator algorithm, and the stability control area is divided into a stable region, a transition region, and an unstable region according to the center-of-mass deviation angle. Then the weights of the three subsystems are determined by judging the control area of the vehicle. The lower controller distributes the additional torque from the final calculation of the upper controller to the driving wheels through an allocation algorithm. Finally, using the CarSim/Simulink simulation platform and the dSPACE hardware-in-the-loop real-time simulation platform, the effectiveness and real-time performance of the steering coordination control strategy are verified by simulation experiments under typical working conditions, such as double shift line, step, and sinusoid.

AB For the last two decades, an extensive transition in automotive X-in-the-loop activities from isolated electronic control units to real-time related, geographically distributed validation tasks has occurred. Benefits are strengthening frontloading, enabling concurrent engineering and reducing prototypes and testing efforts. As a downside, comprehensive system understanding and adequate simulation models must be provided. New technological trends like software-over-the-air-updates denote a continuous validation process even after the start of production. The present review focuses on the virtual validation of vehicle longitudinal dynamics. This exemplary field of application receives more and more attention as electrification of the vehicle powertrain accelerates, and this property directly influences the vehicle DNA. A systematic review process based on the PRISMA workflow has been conducted, focusing on drivability-related powertrain applications. The investigation reveals the following trends: First, increasing complexity of virtualisation methods and models for validation activities influenced by vehicle-to-everything and geographically distributed development. Second, missing standards for virtual validation and proof of representativeness for combined real-virtual testing. In addition, many studies only contemplate the advantages of hardware-in-the-loop-driven development, disregarding crucial limitations and risks for such approaches. In conclusion, there is no longer the question of whether to validate virtually but how to comprehensible realise virtual validation.

AB Research is being conducted on developing a compact deep-sea-monitoring robot system. In the first stage of a mission, a launcher (containing a vehicle inside) descends under gravity from the surface to the seafloor and approaches a target point on the seafloor. To clarify the best configuration for effective horizontal movement during this descending motion, preliminary calculations are made for two types of configurations: a fuselage with fins and rudders, and a fuselage with rudders but no fins. Experiments conducted in a deep-sea model basin confirmed the basic mechanism for descending motion under both configurations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, realizing machine learning (ML)-based technologies with the aid of mobile edge computing (MEC) in the vehicular network to establish an intelligent transportation system (ITS) has gained considerable interest. To fully utilize the data and onboard units of vehicles, it is possible to implement federated learning (FL), which can locally train the model and centrally aggregate the results, in the vehicular edge computing (VEC) system for a vision of connected and autonomous vehicles. In this article, we review and present the concept of FL and introduce a general architecture of FL-assisted VEC to advance development of FL in the vehicular network. The enabling technologies for designing such a system are discussed and, with a focus on the vehicle selection algorithm, performance evaluations are conducted. Recommendations on future research directions are highlighted as well.

AB This article presents a novel rapidly-exploring adaptive sampling tree algorithm for adaptive sampling missions using a hybrid aerial underwater vehicle (HAUV) in an air-sea 3-D environment. This algorithm innovatively combines the tournament-based point selection sampling strategy, the information heuristic search process, and the framework of the rapidly-exploring random tree algorithm. Hence, the vehicle can be guided to a region of interest to scientists for sampling and generate a collision-free path for maximizing information collection by the HAUV under the constraints of environmental effects of currents or wind and a limited budget. The simulation results show that the fast search adaptive sampling tree algorithm has higher optimization performance, faster solution speed, and better stability than the rapidly-exploring information gathering tree algorithm and the particle swarm optimization algorithm.

AB Recently, unmanned surface vehicles (USV) are being actively developed. For USVs to be put to practical use, it is necessary to secure safety by preventing collisions with general ships. To this end, USVs must avoid opposing vessels based on international regulations for preventing collisions at sea (COLREGs, 1972). This paper proposes an algorithm for USVs to avoid collisions with opposing vessels based on COLREG rules. The proposed algorithm predicts dangerous situations based on distance to closest point of approach (DCPA) and time to closest point of approach (TCPA). It allows USVs to avoid opponent ships based on the dynamic window approach (DWA). The DWA has been improved to comply with COLREGs, and we implemented a simulation and compared the standard DWA with the COLREG-compliant DWA (CCDWA) proposed in this paper. The results confirm that the CCDWA complies with COLREGs.

AB Minimum time to target is one of the primary goals of a global strike mission. The Hypersonic Cruise Vehicle and the Common Aero Vehicle are currently being investigated for mission effectiveness. Additional mission requirements include passage through intermediate waypoints and avoidance of no-fly zones. Thus, a real-time or near real-time autonomous trajectory generation technique is desired to minimize the flight time, satisfy terminal and multiple intermediate state constraints, and remain within specified control limitations. The research herein presents a baseline technique, an analytical geometric trajectory optimization technique, and a dynamic optimization technique. Numerical examples for constant speed trajectories as well as decelerating flight are used to demonstrate and compare the presented techniques. These results show the significant time savings achievable through optimization, the accuracy and computation efficiency of the geometric solution, and the robustness and application of the dynamic optimization technique.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are a vital direction for intelligent transportation; nevertheless, the current research is insufficient, and the aspects and mechanisms that influence individuals' adoption of AVs require additional investigation. This study examines the acceptance of the popularity of AVs from three perspectives: personal-psychological attributes, travel characteristics attributes, and latent variables. The descriptive statistical analysis revealed that the acceptance rate of AVs was 54.6% based on 304 valid questionnaires received through online questionnaires. And the proportion of the 18 similar to 50 group in the article reached 92.8%; thus, this study takes the young group as the object to investigate the acceptance of AVs. A quantitative analysis of each factor's impact on the acceptability of AVs was conducted using the hybrid choice model (HCM), which was utilized to observe the link between latent variables. Results from parameter estimates demonstrate that the HCM's fitting impact when latent factors are taken into account is superior to that when latent variables are not taken into account. When latent variables are taken into account, the associated goodness ratio coefficient rises by 0.2337 to 0.2898, which is greater than the model as a whole. The three factors with the highest impact on AV acceptability among the five latent variables were attitude toward use, sense of use gain, and perceived trust, with matching z-test values of 2.42, 2.44, and 2.12, respectively. The development and marketing of AVs by pertinent businesses and government agencies would benefit greatly from this research as a source of reference.

AB Routing controllability of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) has been shown to reduce the adverse effects of selfish routing on the network efficiency. However, the assumption that CAV owners would readily allow themselves to be controlled externally by a central agency for the good of the system is unrealistic. In this paper, we propose a joint routing and pricing control scheme that aims to incentivize CAVs to seek centrally controlled system-optimal (SO) routing by saving on tolls while user equilibrium (UE) seeking human-driven vehicles (HVs) are subject to a congestion charge. The problem is formulated as a bi-level optimization program where the upper level optimizes the dynamic toll rates using the network fundamental diagram (NFD) and the lower level is a mixed equilibrium simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment model (SBDTA) considering different combinations of SO-seeking CAVs. We apply a feedback-based controller to solve for the optimal spatially differentiated distance-based congestion charge from which SO seeking CAVs are exempt; but UE-seeking HVs are subject to the charge for entering the city center. To capture the distinct microscopic behavior of CAVs in the mixed autonomy traffic, we also implement an adaptive link fundamental diagram (FD) within the SBDTA model. The proposed joint control scheme encourages CAV owners to seek SO routing resulting in less total system travel time. It also discourages UE-seeking HVs from congesting the city center. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme in both a small network and a large-scale network of Melbourne, Australia.

AB Anti-jerk controllers, commonly implemented in production vehicles, reduce the longitudinal acceleration oscillations transmitted to the passengers, which are caused by the torsional dynamics of the drivetrain during torque transients. Hence, these controllers enhance comfort, drivability, and drivetrain component durability. Although anti-jerk controllers are commonly implemented in conventional production internal-combustion-engine-driven vehicles, the topic of anti-jerk control has recently been the subject of increased academic and industrial interest, because of the trend towards powertrain electrification, and the distinctive features of electric powertrains, such as the high torque generation bandwidth and absence of clutch dampers. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of automotive anti-jerk control, with particular attention to control structures that are practically implementable on real vehicles. The survey starts with an overview of the causes of the longitudinal vehicle acceleration oscillations that follow abrupt changes in the powertrain torque delivery. The main body of the text reviews examples of anti-jerk controllers, and categorizes them according to the adopted error variable. The ancillary functions of typical anti-jerk controllers, e.g., their activation and deactivation conditions, are explained. The paper concludes with the most recent development trends, and ideas for future work, including possible applications of model predictive control as well as integration of anti-jerk controllers with autonomous driving systems and other vehicle control functions.

AB The increasing interest in autonomous marine systems and related applications has motivated, among others, the development of systems and algorithms for the dynamic positioning of underactuated marine vehicles (ships, surface vessels and underwater vehicles) under the influence of unknown environmental disturbances. In this paper, we present a state feedback control solution for the navigation and practical stabilisation of an underactuated marine vehicle under non-vanishing current disturbances, by means of hybrid control. The proposed solution involves a logic-based switching control strategy among simple state feedback controllers, which renders the position trajectories of the vehicle practically stable to a goal set around a desired position. The control scheme consists of three control laws; the first one is active out of the goal set and drives the system trajectories into this set, based on a novel dipolar vector field. The other two control laws are active in the goal set and alternately regulate the position and the orientation of the vehicle, so that the switched system is practically stable around the desired position. The overall system is shown to be robust, in the sense that the vehicle enters and remains into the goal set even if the external current disturbance is unknown, varying and only its maximum bound (magnitude) is given. The efficacy of the proposed solution is demonstrated through simulation results.

AB This paper presents an original guidance system able to confer a tactical behavior to multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), such as quadcopters, that operate in potentially hostile, unknown, cluttered environments. By applying this guidance system, UAVs complete the assigned tasks, such as reaching a goal set, while minimizing both their exposure to opponents, whose location is unknown, and the predictability of their trajectories. A taxonomy of flight behaviors is provided to help users tuning those parameters that characterize the UAV's level of cautiousness. This guidance system is supported by an original navigation system that exploits exclusively information gathered by onboard cameras and inertial measurement units. Numerical simulations and flight tests validate the applicability of the proposed guidance system in real-time, while performing all calculations aboard the UAV.

AB This paper presents an open-source indoor navigation system for quadrotor micro aerial vehicles (MAVs), implemented in the ROS framework. The system requires a minimal set of sensors including a planar laser range-finder and an inertial measurement unit. We address the issues of autonomous control, state estimation, path-planning, and teleoperation, and provide interfaces that allow the system to seamlessly integrate with existing ROS navigation tools for 2D SLAM and 3D mapping. All components run in real time onboard the MAV, with state estimation and control operating at 1 kHz. A major focus in our work is modularity and abstraction, allowing the system to be both flexible and hardware-independent. All the software and hardware components which we have developed, as well as documentation and test data, are available online.

AB Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction enables safe, comfortable, and optimal proactive motion planning for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Because of rapid advances in learning techniques and increasing access to massive amounts of data, deep learning techniques have been applied to predict vehicle trajectories, especially the long short-term memory (LSTM) model. However, the accurate prediction of vehicle trajectories for congested urban traffic remains problematic, as existing LSTM models do not perform well. To address this gap, this paper proposes to leverage an emerging deep learning technique-transformer-and utilizes a recently released dataset (pNEUMA) for predicting vehicle trajectories in congested urban traffic. The proposed transformer model uses the self-attention mechanism, which helps to identify dependencies within the model inputs, to systematically determine the impacts of vehicular interactions on the target vehicle's future trajectory. The pNEUMA dataset, which provides drone-based large-scale data of congested urban traffic, is processed to fit a typical trajectory prediction scenario, and used to train the transformer model. Numerical studies are conducted to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed modeling approach. A comparison of the proposed model with representative LSTM models highlights the advantages of leveraging the transformer model characteristics for the vehicle trajectory prediction of congested urban traffic. By contrast, existing LSTM models may suffice for the trajectory prediction of freeway traffic. The results also indicate that, unlike for vehicle trajectory prediction for freeway traffic, a longer time window of inputs does not guarantee better prediction performance for congested urban traffic.

ID ALGORITHM; PATHS
AB Nowadays transportation represents an important field for CPS applications due to the rapid development of highly automated or autonomous vehicles, e.g. warehouse vehicles, airport people movers, public transport, etc. These vehicles are usually designed to circulate on fixed routes independently of the actual state of the network in order to fulfil a given criterion, such as traveling on the shortest path or including scheduled stops. This paper introduces a routing approach that allows automated vehicles to travel on different paths between given points, minimising the generalised cost of the route. Between fixed points, which can be either different storage points in a warehouse or simply public transport stops, possible routes are modelled as a continuously updated weighted directed graph. The weights represent relevant parameters of links, collected from surrounding sensors and monitoring systems of the network. Route optimisation is done by Yen's algorithm depending on the timetable: if the vehicle will reach the next stop on time, the alternative with the lowest generalised cost is chosen; else the fastest route is followed. The method is introduced specifically via the problem of traffic congestion on public transport paths, but can be generalised, e.g. any transport system within factories or warehouses.

AB This research on odometry based GPS-denied navigation on multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is focused among the interactions between the odometry sensors and the navigation controller. More precisely, we present a controller architecture that allows to specify a speed specified flight envelope where the quality of the odometry measurements is guaranteed. The controller utilizes a simple point mass kinematic model, described by a set of configurable parameters, to generate a complying speed plan. For experimental testing, we have used down-facing camera optical-flow as odometry measurement. This work is a continuation of prior research to outdoors environments using an AR Drone 2.0 vehicle, as it provides reliable optical flow on a wide range of flying conditions and floor textures. Our experiments show that the architecture is realiable for outdoors flight on altitudes lower than 9 m. A prior version of our code was utilized to compete in the International Micro Air Vehicle Conference and Flight Competition IMAV 2012. The code will be released as an open-source ROS stack hosted on GitHub.

AB Advances in information and signal processing technologies have a significant impact on autonomous driving (AD), improving driving safety while minimizing the efforts of human drivers with the help of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Recently, deep learning (DL) approaches have solved several real-world problems of complex nature. However, their strengths in terms of control processes for AD have not been deeply investigated and highlighted yet. This survey highlights the power of DL architectures in terms of reliability and efficient real-time performance and overviews state-of-the-art strategies for safe AD, with their major achievements and limitations. Furthermore, it covers major embodiments of DL along the AD pipeline including measurement, analysis, and execution, with a focus on road, lane, vehicle, pedestrian, drowsiness detection, collision avoidance, and traffic sign detection through sensing and vision-based DL methods. In addition, we discuss on the performance of several reviewed methods by using different evaluation metrics, with critics on their pros and cons. Finally, this survey highlights the current issues of safe DL-based AD with a prospect of recommendations for future research, rounding up a reference material for newcomers and researchers willing to join this vibrant area of Intelligent Transportation Systems.

ID CONFLICT-RESOLUTION; AIRCRAFT; ALGORITHM
AB Safety in the operations of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) depends on the current and future reduction of technical barriers and on the improvements related to their autonomous capabilities. Since the early stages, aviation has been based on pilots and Air Traffic Controllers that take decisions to make aircraft follow their routes while avoiding collisions. RPA (Remotely Piloted Aircraft) can still involve pilots as they are UAVs controlled from ground, but need the definition of common rules, of a dedicated Traffic Controller and exit strategies in the case of lack of communication between the Ground Control Station and the aircraft. On the other hand, completely autonomous aircraft are currently banned from civil airspace, but researchers and engineers are spending great effort in developing methodologies and technologies to increase the reliability of fully autonomous flight in view of a safe and efficient integration of UAVs in the civil airspace. This paper deals with the design of a collision avoidance system based on a Distributed Model Predictive Controller (DMPC) for trajectory tracking, where anticollision constraints are defined in accordance with the Right of Way rules, as prescribed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for human piloted flights. To reduce the computational burden, the DMPC is formulated as a Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming optimization problem. Simulation results are shown to prove the effectiveness of the approach, also in the presence of a densely populated airspace.

AB A high-precision relative navigation system with applications in the aerospace industry is proposed and validated for the accurate autonomous landing of drones. It relays on the generation of an optical grid from two dual optical comb generators that projects that grid into space where an object, such as an unmanned aerial vehicle, detects its relative position related to the origin of the grid to aid in the high resolution obtaining of the positioning and subsequent guidance of the object. A prototype of the proposed system has been developed, characterized, and tested in a highly relevant environment. The results of flight tests using the proposed system for the high-precision relative positioning of a drone are also presented.

ID SLIDING-MODE CONTROL; PATTERN SEARCH; ZONE
AB An approach of air-to-air autonomous attack occupation for Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAVs) is proposed to improve attack precision and combat effectiveness. According to the shortage of UCAV in the task of attack occupation, kinematic and dynamic models of UCAV and missile loaded on it are formed. Then, attack zone and no-escape zone are calculated by pattern search algorithm, and the optimum attack position is indicated. To arrive at the optimum attack position accurately with restriction of gesture, a novel adaptive sliding mode control method is suggested to design the integrated guidance and control system of UCAV in the process of autonomous attack occupation. Key parameters of the control system are adaptively regulated, which further economize control energy at the same time. The simulation results show that compared with traditional methods our approach can guide the UCAV to the optimum attack position with stable gesture and economize nearly 25% control energy.

AB The hybrid minimum principle is presented for the optimal control of deterministic hybrid systems with both autonomous and controlled switchings and jumps where state jumps at the switching instants are permitted to be accompanied by changes in the dimension of the state space. A feature of particular importance is the explicit presentation of the boundary conditions on the Hamiltonians and the adjoint processes before and after switchings and jumps. The numerical benefit of these expressions are demonstrated on a modified version of the multiple autonomous switchings algorithm. The results are illustrated for the hybrid model of an electric vehicle powertrain with a two-speed transmission.

AB Experiments with a new concept for the precise application of herbicides in a seed line have been conducted. The concept,combines plant recognition, micro-dosing and autonomous robotics. A machine vision system recognises objects to be sprayed, and a micro-dosing system targets very small doses of liquid at the detected objects, while the autonomous vehicle takes care of the navigation. The experiments were carried out under controlled indoor conditions. The results show that the spray liquid can be applied at subcentimetre accuracy and that the application rate can be reduced by two orders of magnitude compared to recommendations used for conventional broadcast spraying.

AB This paper analyzes the potential effects of connected and automated vehicles on saturation headway and capacity at signalized intersections. A signalized intersection is created in Vissim as a testbed, where four vehicle types are modeled and tested: (I) human-driven vehicles (HVs), (II) connected vehicles (CVs), (III) automated vehicles (AVs), and (IV) connected automated vehicles (CAVs). Various scenarios are defined based on different market-penetration rates of these four vehicle types. AVs are assumed to move more cautiously than HVs. CVs and CAVs are supposed to receive information about the future state of traffic lights and adjust their speeds to avoid stopping at the intersection. As a result, their movements are expected to be smoother with a lower number of stops. The effects of these vehicle types in mixed traffic are investigated in relation to saturation headway, capacity, travel time, delay, and queue length in different lane groups of an intersection. A Python script code developed by Vissim is used to provide the communication between the signal controller and CVs and CAVs to adjust their speeds accordingly. The results show that increasing CV and CAV market-penetration rate reduces saturation headway and consequently increases capacity at signalized intersections. On the other hand, increasing the AV market-penetration rate deteriorates traffic operations. Results also indicate that the highest increase (80%) and decrease (20%) in lane-group capacity are observed respectively in a traffic stream of 100% CAVs and 100% AVs.

AB Driving in a human-like manner is important for an autonomous vehicle to be a smart and predictable traffic participant. To achieve this goal, parameters of the motion planning module should be carefully tuned, which needs great effort and expert knowledge. In this study, a method of learning cost parameters of a motion planner from naturalistic driving data is proposed. The learning is achieved by encouraging the selected trajectory to approximate the human driving trajectory under the same traffic situation. The employed motion planner follows a widely accepted methodology that first samples candidate trajectories in the trajectory space, then select the one with minimal cost as the planned trajectory. Moreover, in addition to traditional factors such as comfort, efficiency and safety, the cost function is proposed to incorporate incentive of behavior decision like a human driver, so that both lane change decision and motion planning are coupled into one framework. Two types of lane incentive cost - heuristic and learning based - are proposed and implemented. To verify the validity of the proposed method, a data set is developed by using the naturalistic trajectory data of human drivers collected on the motorways in Beijing, containing samples of lane changes to the left and right lanes, and car followings. Experiments are conducted with respect to both lane change decision and motion planning, and promising results are achieved.

AB With the rise of Deep Learning approaches in computer vision applications, significant strides have been made towards vehicular autonomy. Research activity in autonomous drone navigation has increased rapidly in the past five years, and drones are moving fast towards the ultimate goal of near-complete autonomy. However, while much work in the area focuses on specific tasks in drone navigation, the contribution to the overall goal of autonomy is often not assessed, and a comprehensive overview is needed. In this work, a taxonomy of drone navigation autonomy is established by mapping the definitions of vehicular autonomy levels, as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers, to specific drone tasks in order to create a clear definition of autonomy when applied to drones. A top-down examination of research work in the area is conducted, focusing on drone navigation tasks, in order to understand the extent of research activity in each area. Autonomy levels are cross-checked against the drone navigation tasks addressed in each work to provide a framework for understanding the trajectory of current research. This work serves as a guide to research in drone autonomy with a particular focus on Deep Learning-based solutions, indicating key works and areas of opportunity for development of this area in the future.

AB The demand for freight transportation is on the rise as a result of population growth, increase in the need for energy, and the expansion of global trade. Existing infrastructure for freight transportation seems inadequate for future growth, and new facilities are required to cover the deficiencies in cargo movement. Underground Freight Transportation (UFT) is a new mode of transportation that uses the space below the ground to carry cargo within autonomous vehicles in tunnels and pipelines. Different propulsion systems have been used for freight pipeline systems. The goal of this research is to find the proper propulsion system for the UFT system. In addition, this research aims at finding the minimum power of the propulsion system and energy consumption for the UFT system operation. Two short-haul and long-haul UFT systems with different load sizes are used to test and apply the results of this research. The findings of this research suggest that because of its light weight and short thickness, a Linear Induction Motor (LIM) is an appropriate propulsion system for UFT. Besides, this research estimates that the energy consumption and power requirement of a LIM system is low. The energy consumption of LIM system is calculated as a function of UFT system operating speed. Therefore, the results of this research can be applied in the design, operation and cost estimating of other UFT systems.

AB This paper introduces an effective Foreign Object Debris (FOD) clearance system based on multi-robot coordination. The main objective of this study is to minimize the amount of time airports need to close for the execution of the FOD collection process. At the present time, FOD collection is done by human-operated follow-me vehicles, which is time consuming, expensive and error-prone. Time is a very critical parameter for the aviation domain and a delay of even one minute may cause the failure of a critical military mission or the loss of thousands of dollars at civil aviation. To this end, a multi-robot coordination approach based on auction-based task allocation is proposed in order to handle dynamic task occurrences on the runways of an airport. Robots that are located at stations are coordinated to collect active FOD in the shortest time. An agent-based experimental simulation framework is developed and several FOD collection scenarios are executed on Istanbul Ataturk Airport. The proposed model, which is based on effective robot locating by using heat maps and optimal task assignments, has provided promising results when compared to existing well-known techniques. Application of this study will enable a fully autonomous, safe and fast system that collects FOD, and human-operated vehicles will no longer be needed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This studypresents an analysis of a wide-area side-scansonar survey conducted with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs)at a deep water dump site in the San Pedro Basin, California.
   Disposal of industrial and hazardous waste in the oceanwas a pervasiveglobal practice in the 20th century. Uncertainty in the quantity,location, and contents of dumped materials underscores ongoing risksto marine ecosystems and human health. This study presents an analysisof a wide-area side-scan sonar survey conducted with autonomous underwatervehicles (AUVs) at a dump site in the San Pedro Basin, California.Previous camera surveys located 60 barrels and other debris. Sedimentanalysis in the region showed varying concentrations of the insecticidalchemical dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), of which an estimated350-700 t were discarded in the San Pedro Basin between 1947and 1961. A lack of primary historical documents specifying DDT acidwaste disposal methods has contributed to the ambiguity surroundingwhether dumping occurred via bulk discharge or containerized units.Barrels and debris observed during previous surveys were used forground truth classification algorithms based on size and acousticintensity characteristics. Image and signal processing techniquesidentified over 74,000 debris targets within the survey region. Statistical,spectral, and machine learning methods characterize seabed variabilityand classify bottom-type. These analytical techniques combined withAUV capabilities provide a framework for efficient mapping and characterizationof uncharted deep-water disposal sites.

AB As technology advances, cities are getting smarter. Smart mobility is the key element in smart cities and Autonomous Driving (AV) are an essential part of smart mobility. However, the vulnerability of unmanned vehicles can also affect the value of life and human safety. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of 3D Point-Cloud (3DPC) processing and learning in terms of development, advancement, and performance for the AV system. 3DPC has recently attracted growing interest due to its extensive applications, such as autonomous driving, computer vision, and robotics. Light Detection and Ranging Sensors (LiDAR) is one of the most significant sensors in AV, which collects 3DPC that can accurately capture the outer surfaces of scenes and objects. Learning and processing tools in the 3DPC are essential for creating maps, perceptions, and localization devices in AV. The intention behind 3DPC learning and practical processing tools is to be considered the most essential modules to create, locate, and perceive maps in an AV system. The goal of the study is to know ``what has been tested in AV system so far and what is necessary to make it safer and more practical in AV system.'' We also provide insights into the necessary open problems that are required to be resolved in the future.

AB Highly automated vehicles (AVs) have the potential to improve the journey experience for all users by allowing them to partake in Non-Driving Related Tasks (NDRTs). Using a 42-question online survey of drivers (n = 1378, 59% males, 40% females), and in-depth interviews (n = 18, 56% males, 44% females), this study investigated NDRTs and the motivations for private ownership of highly automated vehicles (AVs). 42% of participants were identified to be more likely to own an AV and, believed that they were safer, would reduce congestion and the risk of accidents. There was also a genuine desire to actively fill the non-driving time being productive or using a device rather than passive tasks such as listening to music or watching their surroundings. Commuting was reported to be the most likely journey type amongst those more likely to own an AV. The commuting journey also showed the most diverse range of NDRTs including social (e.g., conversation, playing games), wellbeing (e.g., eating a meal, sleep), leisure (e.g., watching a video), and being productive (e.g., working on a laptop). This study provides insights into NDRTs to inform future interior vehicle design and motivations for owning highly automated vehicles.

AB Vespa velutina, also known as the Asian hornet, is considered as an invasive species out of its native zone. In particular, since it preys on honey bees, its recent progression in Europe could soon pose a significant risk to the local apiculture activity. European beekeepers are therefore investigating adapted control strategies, including V. velutina nest destruction. Unfortunately, nest location pinpointing generally follows a manual process which can prove tedious, time-consuming and inaccurate. In this article, we propose the use of a network of micro aerial vehicles featuring autonomous and cooperative flight capabilities. We describe an adapted controlled mobility strategy and detail the design of our Virtual Force Protocol (VFP) which allows a swarm of vehicles to track and follow hornets to their nests, while maintaining connectivity through a wireless multi-hop communication route with a remote ground station used to store applicative data such as hornet trajectory and vehicle telemetry. In order to achieve the mission objectives with a minimum of vehicles, we identify through simulations appropriate value for the key parameters of VFP and discuss the obtained network performance.

AB Due to inevitable parameter uncertainties and disturbances, four-wheel independent drive automated vehicles (4WIDAVs) will produce tracking deviation during the path following process, which have a negative impact on driving safety. Meanwhile, the over-actuated feature of 4WIDAVs will also increase the deviation if not properly handled. To solve this problem, a specific adaptive model predictive control strategy for path following of 4WIDAVs is proposed. Firstly, to obtain a real-time and accurate vehicle dynamics model, the recursive least square method is used to estimate the time-varying uncertainty of tire cornering stiffness. Secondly, based on the real-time updating system model, the modified tube-based model predictive control method is applied to realize path following under the influence of the disturbance. Meanwhile, the compensating yaw moment for controlling vehicle is generated by the designed torque distribution algorithm, which makes full use of the over-actuated feature of 4WIDAVs. Finally, different maneuvers are performed both in simulation and experiment. Results show that the proposed strategy can achieve more accurate path following than the traditional model predictive control and linear quadratic regulator. Compared with the existing controller, the path following accuracy is improved by 41.6% and 60% in simulation and experiment, respectively. Therefore, the proposed strategy is proved to be effective, which provides a theoretical reference for vehicle control in reality.

AB For evaluation of vehicle handling, subjective assessment is currently almost the only criterion. For the purpose of reducing cycle time and avoiding error of subjective assessment, the close-loop objective evaluation system through computer simulations has become an inevitable choice [Gwanghun, G.I.M. and Yongchul, C.H.O.I., 2001, Role of tire modeling on the design process of a tire and vehicle system. ITEC ASIA 2001, Busan, Korea, September 18-20; Guo, K., Ding, H., Zhang, J., Lu, J. and Wang, R., 2003, Development of longitudinal and lateral driver model for autonomous vehicle control. International Journal of Vehicle Design, 36(1), 50-65]. For this reason, the more accurate models of vehicle, tire and driver are necessary.
   Since structure and operating conditions of tires are very complicated, many researchers have paid more attention to the modeling of tire properties and varieties of tire model have been done to describe the tire behaviour of longitudinal, lateral forces and aligning moment [Pacejka, H.B., 2002, Tyre and Vehicle Dynamics. Butterworth-Heinemann, an imprint of Elsevier Science, ISBN 0-7506-5141-5]. However, there are few studies for the tire overturning moment (TOM), especially under large slip angle and camber angle. For the simulation of vehicle rollover, the expression accuracy of TOM is rather important. In addition, the difference of the loaded radius of left and right tires yields tire roll angle and that also affects vehicle roll behavior. In this paper, the modeling of TOM and loaded radius are presented first, and then the modeling results are compared with tire test data.

AB With the development of vehicle navigation, autonomous driving and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), increasing spoofing attacks of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) have emerged towards vehicles, which can mislead users by false position, velocity and time (PVT) solutions, resulting in serious consequences. Spoofer localization is a necessary step to fundamentally address the spoofing attacks. Most of the conventional spoofer localization methods are based on time of arrival (TOA) or time difference of arrival (TDOA), where time synchronization is indispensable and therefore is hard to apply to the existing vehicles equipped with independent commercial receivers. To cope with this problem, in this paper we develop a flexible method for vehicles to locate a stationary spoofer based on Doppler and clock drift double difference (DCDD). DCDD is calculated using Doppler measurements and clock drift solutions of one vehicular receiver and another reference receiver. Generally, Doppler frequency of GNSS signals changes slowly with time, which releases the restriction for high-precision time synchronization. DCDD represents the Doppler frequency caused by the vehicle motion, from which the spoofer position can be estimated. Utilizing DCDD, an iterative weighted least squares (WLS) algorithm is used to solve the spoofer position, and a closed-form initial value is given to improve the convergence rate. We evaluate the localization performance by the derived Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) in the presence of vehicle position and velocity errors. Simulations and field vehicle experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility and effective of the proposed method.

AB Technological advances with connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have opened opportunities to increase the efficiency of transportation networks. A novel control framework called combined flexible lane assignment and reservation-based intersection control (CFLARIC) system has been recently proposed for better management of directionally unrestricted CAVs traffic flows in an urban environment. CFLARIC offers a full spectrum of lane assignment possibilities in combination with the appropriate reservation-based intersection control. In CFLARIC, vehicles position themselves in a proper lane before they reach the downstream intersection, which enables resolution of vehicular conflicts both between intersections and within the intersection boxes. Although CFLARIC has shown promising results, only a limited number of lane assignment scenarios have been designed and tested using some preset rules and based on the previous research objectives. Therefore, the optimality of their performance has never been studied. The objective of this study is to address the flexible traffic lane assignment in such a system as a network optimization problem, in which an optimal lane assignment schema is achieved using metaheuristic optimization algorithms. To this end, a combination of NetLogo and the BehaviorSearch tool is utilized for the simulation modeling and optimization process using random search and brute-force as the search algorithms. The output of the optimization process is the lane assignment that leads to a minimum total travel time for a given network geometry and traffic volumes. Results indicate that a flexible control concept such as optimized CFLARIC has great potential to improve the efficiency of traffic control strategies with CAVs.

TI Joint Optimization Scheme for the Planning and Operations of Shared
   Autonomous Electric Vehicle Fleets Serving Mobility on Demand
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB As the transportation sector undergoes three major transformations-electrification, shared/on-demand mobility, and automation-there are new challenges to analyzing the impacts of these trends on both the transportation system and the power sector. Most models that analyze the requirements of fleets of shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEVs) operate at the scale of an urban region, or smaller. A quadratically constrained, quadratic programming problem is formulated, designed to model the requirements of SAEVs at a national scale. The size of the SAEV fleet, the necessary charging infrastructure, the fleet charging schedule, and the dispatch required to serve demand for trips in a region are treated as decision variables. By minimizing both the amortized cost of the fleet and chargers as well as the operational costs of charging, it is possible to explore the coupled interactions between system design and operation. To apply the model at a national scale, key complications about fleet operations are simplified; but a detailed agent-based regional simulation model to parameterize those simplifications is leveraged. Preliminary results are presented, finding that all mobility in the United States (U.S.) currently served by 276 million personally owned vehicles could be served by 12.5 million SAEVs at a cost of $ 0.27/vehicle-mile or $ 0.18/passenger-mile. The energy requirements for this fleet would be 1142 GWh/day (8.5% of 2017 U.S. electricity demand) and the peak charging load 76.7 GW (11% of U.S. power peak). Several model sensitivities are explored, and it is found that sharing is a key factor in the analysis.

AB The automotive market today has seen the entry of Level-3 conditional automated driving vehicles equipped with an automated driving system that waits for the drivers to start it on the road. Before making a full assessment of the use of automated driving systems, drivers should be made to experience real-world conditional automated driving. A driver may have a mood change when driving a real-world automated vehicle. This emotion points to the mediation of motivation, which affects a driver's cognition and intention to start an automated driving system on the road. In this study, the emotion of experiencing autonomous driving, cognition, and satisfaction of the driving performance were introduced to construct an intention model to start an automated driving system. Online and off-line questionnaires were adopted, and the emotional response, cognition of automated driving, and intention of 133 drivers who experienced real-world conditional automated driving were determined. Driver experience was assessed in four scenarios as part of emotional tests: during manual driving, during conditional automated driving, during takeover under the influence of the warning system, and during takeover driving. The results of the questionnaire showed a significant positive correlation between emotion and cognition, satisfaction of autonomous driving performance, and the intent to start the automated driving system. Emotions play a mediating role between cognition, satisfaction, and intention to start automated driving. Drivers who experienced conditional automated driving appeared to exhibit a moderately high level of emotional response in terms of joy, interest, and surprise, whereas medium-level negative emotions included fear and anger. Drivers experienced some intensity of emotional changes during conditional automated driving and takeover driving. The emotional changes were uneven but encouraging support was reported. In addition, specific hypotheses relating the driving performance of the automated vehicles (in terms of programmed design of takeover and warning system of takeover) to the emotional dimensions were tested. A cluster analysis of the emotional response measures revealed five different emotional patterns when experiencing the real-world automated vehicle, among which the happy/satisfied group had higher intention to start an automated driving system on the road, followed by the emotional group, whereas the disgust group showed the lowest intention. The cluster analysis was supported by demographic and driving cognitive characteristics (age, education, and self-evaluation of the driving level and driving experience) of the five groups of drivers. Finally, the theoretical and practical significance of this study was expounded. The research results may provide some suggestions and hints for the government and enterprises to promote the development of automated driving.

AB In order for any construction to arise on the sea bottom, the area around has to be carefully cleaned from all dangerous objects including ferromagnetic objects like ammunition or the remains of sea mines. Magnetic anomaly detectors (MAD) which are composed of a set of magnetometers are applied to detect such objects. The combined signal of all the magnetometers moving near the sea bottom is a base for detecting anomalies in the Earth magnetic field produced by ferromagnetic objects. To carry the magnetometers, underwater vehicles can be used. However, in order for the vehicles to be able to fulfill the role of MAD, they have to move near the sea bottom in a tight swarm formation. In the paper, a modular neuro-evolutionary controller is presented which leads each swarm member along a desired trajectory, with the time synchronization, and at the certain distance from the sea bottom. In order to design the controller, two neuro-evolutionary algorithms were applied, i.e. Hill Climb Modular Assembler Encoding (HCMAE) and Differential Evolution (DE). During tests carried out in simulation conditions, initially in 2D and then also in a 3D environment, under the influence of sea current, neuro-controllers evolved by HCMAE and DE were compared with algorithmic and PID-like controllers. The tests showed that the solutions proposed in the paper are more effective than the reference solutions and proved that even in unfavorable underwater conditions it is possible to precisely keep the trajectory specified both spatially and temporally.

AB Multi-vehicle rear-end (MVRE) crashes during small-scale inclement (SSI) weather cause high fatality rates on freeways, which cannot be solved by traditional speed limit strategies. This study aimed to reduce MVRE crash risks during SSI weather using different longitudinal driver assistance systems (LDAS). The impact factors on MVRE crashes during SSI weather were firstly analyzed. Then, four LDAS, including Forward collision warning (FCW), Autonomous emergency braking (AEB), Adaptive cruise control (ACC) and Cooperative ACC (CACC), were modeled based on a unified platform, the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM). Simulation experiments were designed and a large number of simulations were then conducted to evaluate safety effects of different LDAS. Results indicate that the FCW and ACC system have poor performance on reducing WIRE crashes during SSI weather. The slight improvement of sight distance of FCW and the limitation of perception-reaction time of ACC lead the failure of avoiding MVRE crashes in most scenarios. The AEB system has the better effect due to automatic perception and reaction, as well as performing the full brake when encountering SSI weather. The CACC system has the best performance because wireless communication provides a larger sight distance and a shorter time delay at the sub-second level. Sensitivity analyses also indicated that the larger number of vehicles and speed changes after encountering SSI weather have negative impacts on safety performances. Results of this study provide useful information for accident prevention during SSI weather.

AB Early detection of marine invasive species is key for mitigating and managing their impacts to marine ecosystems and industries. Human divers are considered the gold standard tool for detecting marine invasive species, especially when dive teams are familiar with the local biodiversity. However, diver operations can be expensive and dangerous, and are not always practical. Remote operated vehicles (ROVs) can potentially overcome these limitations, but it is unclear how sensitive they are compared to trained divers for detecting pests. We assessed the sensitivity and efficiency of ROVs and divers for detecting marine non-indigenous species (NIS), including the potential for automated detection algorithms to reduce post-processing costs of ROV methods. We show that ROVs can detect comparable assemblages of invasive species as divers, but with lower detection rates (0.2 NIS min(-1)) than divers (0.5 NIS min(-1)) and covered less seafloor than divers per unit time. While small invertebrates (e.g., skeleton shrimp Caprella mutica) were more easily detected by divers, the invasive goby Acentrogobius pflaumii was only detected by the ROV. We show that implementation of computer vision algorithms can provide accurate identification of larger biofouling organisms and reduce overall survey costs, yet the relative costs of ROV surveys remain almost twice that of diver surveys. We expect that as ROV technologies improve and investment in autonomous and semi-autonomous underwater vehicles increases, much of the current inefficiencies of ROVs will be mitigated, yet practitioners should be aware of limitations in taxonomic resolution and the strengths of specialist diver teams.

AB Recent academic research and industrial commitments highlight the potential of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in transforming the way we travel. However, there are some anticipated barriers associated with the widespread consumer adoption of CAVs, including but not limited to low user acceptance, cybersecurity, safety, and legislation. The existing literature is non-existent in capturing the impact of information received from multiple sources (peers, car dealers, media advertisements, and personal research) on the consumers' acceptance of CAVs while considering these barriers associated with CAV. In this direction, we quantify the impact of the multiple information sources on the individuals concerned and indifferent about the anticipated barriers of CAVs to boost their acceptance while utilizing a two-step econometric framework based on an online survey of 4,448 Tennesseans. The two-step modeling framework utilizes latent class analysis followed by a multivariate ordered logit model. Results indicated that the elderly, three or more person households, and residents interested in owning a CAV are more likely to be concerned about CAV barriers. In contrast, males, physically challenged, and residents willing to pay higher for CAV are more likely to be indifferent toward CAV barriers. Among concerned individuals, the elderly, females, and residents willing to pay more than $30 k for a conventional car are more likely to rely on car dealers when purchasing a CAV. The results of this study are expected to assist automakers, technology companies, policymakers, and third-party agencies to advertise, promote and introduce CAVs effectively through appropriate information channel(s) to boost their consumer acceptance.

AB This article investigates the consensus tracking problem of the heterogeneous multivehicle systems (MVSs) under a repeatable control environment. First, a unified iterative learning control (ILC) algorithm is presented for all autonomous vehicles, each of which is governed by both discrete- and continuous-time nonlinear dynamics. Then, several consensus criteria for MVSs with switching topology and external disturbances are established based on our proposed distributed ILC protocols. For discrete-time systems, all vehicles can perfectly track to the common reference trajectory over a specified finite time interval, and the corresponding digraphs may not have spanning trees. Existing approaches dealing with the continuous-time systems generally require that all vehicles have strictly identical initial conditions, being too ideal in practice. We relax this unpractical assumption and propose an extra distributed initial state learning protocol such that vehicles can take different initial states, leading to the fact that the finite time tracking is achieved ultimately regardless of the initial errors. Finally, a numerical example demonstrates the effectiveness of our theoretical results.

AB Information Centric Networks (ICNs) overcome the current IP-based networks weakness and aim to ensure efficient data distribution. The Main ICN features are location-independent naming, in-network caching, name based routing, built-in security, and high mobility. ICN vehicular networks stratify the ICN architecture on the Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) to reinforce a massive amount of data transmission and handle the critical time interests inside the vehicular networks while taking into consideration the vehicles' high mobility. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) gather the real-time data from the vehicular networks to build their own platforms and figure out new features serving autonomous vehicles, vehicle safety, and traffic management. This introduces new vulnerabilities through the vehicles' interaction with the outside networks. Accordingly, it is important to understand the VANETs' attacks to fulfill the security goals. In this paper, we survey the different attacks on VANETs and ICN, and focus on the newly introduced attacks in the integrated platform between ICN and VANETs. We propose a taxonomy for ICN vehicular attacks. In addition, evaluate the attacks and identify their security levels.

AB Three main changes are currently taking place in the context of the automotive industry: electrification of vehicle propulsion, automated driving and a shift towards mobility as a service. While the first two represent opportunities for the industry growth, the later questions the private ownership of a car. Keeping the concept of a privately owned car will involve reducing the economical and environmental cost of such ownership. In this paper, we address the reduction of the parking footprint of cars, leveraging on electrification and low-level driving automation to more than double the density of cars parked in a given area, compared to conventional parking lots. We perform a complete evaluation of different strategies of vehicle coordination based on large-scale datasets of parking sessions in distinct scenarios and under varying demand patterns. Our results on the key metrics, namely area per vehicle, travel distance while parked, and removal time - clearly highlight the relevance and efficiency of this novel approach to parking. We also empirically derive guidelines for designing high-density parking systems (e.g. parking lot layout or capacity) and show the involved trade-offs.

AB Fully automated vehicles (FAVs) are predicted to enter the passenger vehicle market in the near future. Being a new technology, there is significant uncertainty on adoption by users. There is a need for studies on the user acceptance of autonomous vehicles. This study aims to assess user acceptance of FAVs in a middle-income country, Iran, by adopting and comparing three popular user acceptance models: Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). The data were collected via an online survey of 1381 drivers (with valid driver's license) from different cities in Iran.The results showed that while 49.4% of participants had never heard of FAVs, the majority of them showed a high intention to use FAVs in the future. All three models successfully explained the behavioral intention to use FAVs. The TPB model was the best performing model to represent acceptance, which explained 70.9% of the variance in behavioral intention with subjective norms as the strongest predictor of the model, followed by attitudes toward FAVs as a significant predictor of intention to use them. The UTAUT model constructs accounted for 69.6% of the variance in intention, followed by the TAM model, which explained 57.6% of the variance in intention to use FAVs.Considering that the study on public perceptions of FAVs in middle-income countries is almost non-existent in the literature, it is expected that the current study will be a benchmarking resource for a comparative study for countries with a similar socio-economic and cultural context as the current study.

TI Optimization Model of Autonomous Vehicle Parking Facilities, Developed

AB Fully self-driving cars, or autonomous vehicles (AVs), will have self-parking functions, which will revolutionize and reshape parking facilities in several ways. Automated parking technology could realize high-density and intensive parking space efficiency through multirow layouts and with narrower spaces per vehicle, which would completely change traditional parking facilities. Nonetheless, extra movements and congestion are generated by releasing stuck vehicles inside rows of parking spaces. Profits in parking space efficiency might be reduced by losses extra movements and congestion. This article aims to optimize the multirow and multichannel layout of parking facilities for AVs, balancing maximal space utilization and minimal movements while satisfying a designated parking demand. A new moving strategy, "first storage and shortest moving to outdistance (FSSMD), " is put forward first. Then, the geometric attributes, other movement strategies, demand characteristics, and other design elements of parking facilities are comprehensively quantified to describe the profit and loss of self-parking. An optimization model for the multirow layout of parking spaces is constructed with the dual goals of maximizing the number of berths and minimizing the number of movements. The nondominated sorting genetic algorithm with an elite strategy 2 is designed to solve the optimal model. Finally, the optimal zones and layouts of parking facilities are put forward by numerical experiments, and the sensitivity of different moving strategies is discussed. The results show that the moving strategy based on the FSSMD significantly reduces expected movement times, without decreasing the utilization rate of parking spaces. Although having only one zone enables maximizing the number of parking berths and the utilization rate of parking facilities, such benefits and improvements might be compromised by additional movements. Therefore, the multirow optimal layout with a zoning of 4 and 2 interzone channels should be decided by assessing the paradoxical relationships between the maximal utilization rate and minimal movements.

AB This paper outlines the design and testing process of the hull of a deep small Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), rated at 2000m depth. Many existing AUV pressure housings use aluminum or other isotropic traditional metals, instead of composites due to the complexities of the design of composites at such big load. The research at hand explains the process of design starting from setting the geometrical constraints for the design to mass production. To the best of the authors' knowledge, none of the previous studies has presented such detailed description of the work. Carbon fiber reinforced epoxy material was chosen thanks to its high strength-to-weight ratio and similarity of its compressibility to sea water. Material characterization was performed to obtain the material properties under loading conditions using a modified method of the Combined Loading Compression testing technique. A specific fixture was designed and manufactured to test filament-wound tubes. An analytical model was developed using MATLAB, a finite element model was created using ABAQUS, and the results of the two models were compared. A set of recommendations was introduced for the stacking sequence to provide the lowest possible stresses, regardless on the diving depth of the vehicle. Afterwards, a quality control set of tests was conducted, including seawater absorption under high pressure and void analysis using destructive and non-destructive tests. Pilot samples were manufactured and tested in a pressure vessel, where it was cycle-tested and inspected using visual and ultrasonic testing. Other samples were fail-tested and showed a failure at similar to 93% of the expected failure load. Such range can be considered good to provide safe operation for the vehicle at the designated depth, given that the factor of safety included covers more than 7% of the failure load. The proposed design methodology has shown that CFRE can be safely used even at such high depths.

AB For the parallel parking problem in narrow space, this paper proposes a trajectory tracking control method with a novel trajectory planning layer for autonomous parallel parking based on a numerical optimization algorithm and model predictive control. In the trajectory planning layer, the vehicle kinematics model suitable for the low-velocity parking scene is established. Considering the vehicle physical constraints, boundary condition constraints, and obstacle avoidance constraints during the parking process, the parking trajectory planning task is described as an optimal control problem, further transformed into a nonlinear programming problem by Gauss pseudo-spectral method. Taking the shortest parking completion time as the optimization objective function, the parking trajectories of the large, medium and small parking spaces are obtained, respectively. A parking trajectory tracking controller based on the model predictive control algorithm is designed in the trajectory tracking control layer. The linear error model is used as the prediction model, and the quadratic programming is adopted as the rolling optimization algorithm in the tracking controller. The velocity and front-wheel swing angle are obtained as control signals for parking trajectory tracking. Through CarSim and Simulink's co-simulation, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed parallel parking trajectory planning and tracking control method are verified. The co-simulation results show that the maximum tracking errors of horizontal and longitudinal positions are less than 0.15m. The maximum tracking errors of heading angle are less than 2 degrees under three different parking spaces. Real vehicle tests are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical control method. The test results show that the vehicle can park in the parking space safely, quickly and accurately when the actual parking space is detected. The proposed method can plan the parking trajectory with the constraints and the shortest time and control the vehicle to complete the parking operation accurately along the planned trajectory.

AB Introduction: In recent years, Australia is seeing an increase in the total number of cyclists. However, the rise of serious injuries and fatalities to cyclists has been a major concern. Understanding the factors affecting the fatalities and injuries of bicyclists in crashes with motor vehicles is important to develop effective policy measures aimed at improving the safety of bicyclists. This study aims to identify the factors affecting motor vehicle-bicycle (MVB) crashes in Victoria, Australia and introducing effective countermeasures for the identified risk factors. Method: A data set of 14,759 MVB crash records from Victoria, Australia between 2006 and 2019 was analyzed using the binary logit model and latent class clustering. Results: It was observed that the factors that increase the risk of fatalities and serious injuries of bicyclists (FSI) in all clusters are: elderly bicyclist, not using a helmet, and darkness condition. Likewise, in areas with no traffic control, clear weather, and dry surface condition (cluster 1), high speed limits increase the risk of FSI, but the occurrence of MVB crashes in cross intersection and T-intersection has been significantly associated with a reduction in the risk of FSI. In areas with traffic control and unfavorable weather conditions (cluster 2), wet road surface increases the risk of FSI, but the areas with give way sign and pedestrian crossing signs reduce the risk of FSI. Practical Applications: Recommendations to reduce the risk of fatalities or serious injury to bicyclists are: improvement of road lighting and more exposure of bicyclists using reflective clothing and reflectors, separation of the bicycle and vehicle path in mid blocks especially in high-speed areas, using a more stable bicycle for the older people, monitoring helmet use, improving autonomous emergency braking, and using bicyclist detection technology for vehicles.

AB In this letter, we analyze a terrestrial wireless communication network assisted by an aerial intelligent reflecting surface (AIRS). We consider a packet scheduling problem at the ground base station (BS) aimed at improving the information freshness by selecting packets based on their ages of information (AoIs). To further improve the communication quality, the trajectory of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) which carries the IRS is optimized with joint active and passive beamforming design. To solve the formulated non-convex problem, we propose an iterative optimization problem based on successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm. The simulation results show significant performance improvement in terms of weighted sum AoI, and the SCA solution converges quickly with low computational complexity.

ID OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE
AB This paper presents an integrated planning and control algorithm for the navigation of an autonomous rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicle in a cluttered environment. The model predictive control combined with a potential fieldlike function integrates planning and control in a single step. This strategy enables the generation of dynamically feasible motion because the planning is done in the action space of the rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicle. Moreover, it is able to respond promptly to abrupt changes in the environment because the reactive obstacle-avoidance method only considers local sensory information. Finally, the shortsightedness of control-based reactive methods can be relieved by the larger planning horizon of the model predictive control. Simulation results show that the proposed integrated planning and control method can complete the navigation mission successfully in a cluttered environment, and it can be applicable to more complicated missions, such as weed surveillance and management.

AB This paper proposes a unique Graph SLAM framework to generate precise 2.5D LIDAR maps in an XYZ plane. A node strategy was invented to divide the road into a set of nodes. The LIDAR point clouds are smoothly accumulated in intensity and elevation images in each node. The optimization process is decomposed into applying Graph SLAM on nodes' intensity images for eliminating the ghosting effects of the road surface in the XY plane. This step ensures true loop-closure events between nodes and precise common area estimations in the real world. Accordingly, another Graph SLAM framework was designed to bring the nodes' elevation images into the same Z-level by making the altitudinal errors in the common areas as small as possible. A robust cost function is detailed to properly constitute the relationships between nodes and generate the map in the Absolute Coordinate System. The framework is tested against an accurate GNSS/INS-RTK system in a very challenging environment of high buildings, dense trees and longitudinal railway bridges. The experimental results verified the robustness, reliability and efficiency of the proposed framework to generate accurate 2.5D maps with eliminating the relative and global position errors in XY and Z planes. Therefore, the generated maps significantly contribute to increasing the safety of autonomous driving regardless of the road structures and environmental factors.

AB The work presented in this paper deals with the problem of autonomous and intelligent navigation of mobile manipulator, where the unavailability of a complete mathematical model of robot systems and uncertainties of sensor data make the used of approximate reasoning to the design of autonomous motion control very attractive.
   A modular fuzzy navigation method in changing and dynamic unstructured environments has been developed. For a manipulator arm, we apply the robust adaptive fuzzy reactive motion planning developed in [J.B. Mbede, X. Huang, M. Wang, Robust neuro-fuzzy sensor-based motion control among dynamic obstacles for robot manipu- lators, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems 11 (2) (2003) 249-261]. But for the vehicle platform, we combine the advantages of probabilistic roadmap as global planner and fuzzy reactive based on idea of elastic band. This fuzzy local planner based on a computational efficient processing scheme maintains a permanent flexible path between two nodes in network generated by a probabilistic roadmap approach. In order to consider the compatibility of stabilization, mobilization and manipulation, we add the input of system stability in vehicle fuzzy navigation so that the mobile manipulator can avoid stably unknown and/or dynamic obstacles. The purpose of an integration of robust controller and modified Elman neural network (MENN) is to deal with uncertainties, which can be translated in the output membership functions of fuzzy systems.

AB The growing concern about the risk and safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has made it vital to understand driver trust and behavior when operating AVs. While research has uncovered human factors and design issues based on individual driver performance, there remains a lack of insight into how trust in automation evolves in groups of people who face risk and uncertainty while traveling in AVs. To this end, we conducted a naturalistic experiment with groups of participants who were encouraged to engage in conversation while riding a Tesla Model X on campus roads. Our methodology was uniquely suited to uncover these issues through naturalistic interaction by groups in the face of a risky driving context. Conversations were analyzed, revealing several themes pertaining to trust in automation: (1) collective risk perception, (2) experimenting with automation, (3) group sense-making, (4) human-automation interaction issues, and (5) benefits of automation. Our findings highlight the untested and experimental nature of AVs and confirm serious concerns about the safety and readiness of this technology for on-road use. The process of determining appropriate trust and reliance in AVs will therefore be essential for drivers and passengers to ensure the safe use of this experimental and continuously changing technology. Revealing insights into social group-vehicle interaction, our results speak to the potential dangers and ethical challenges with AVs as well as provide theoretical insights on group trust processes with advanced technology.

AB Accident detection in autonomous vehicles could save lives by reducing the time it takes for information to reach emergency responder. One of the most common reason for the death of humans is accident. Indeed, it was determined throughout the survey that road accidents are indeed the second greatest cause of death in the United States for people aged 30 to 44 years, representing for 1/3 among all deaths. The transportation industry is increasingly relying on mathematical methods and new data assets to detect injuries. Many machine learning and deep learning models have already been proposed for accident detection but still there is much space for further improvement to be done to save human lives in case of accident detection, if accidents are not identified well. In our present study, we proposed modified restricted Boltzmann machine for accident detection. Our proposed methodology consists of the following steps. In the first step, we took different accidental and nonaccidental images as an input. In the second step, we applied our proposed deep learning technique modified restricted Boltzmann machine. In the third step, when weight acceleration and coefficient adjustments are run as a generalization mechanism, then we check our model performance after applying through multiple procedures. As a result, multiple images are classified as accidental and nonaccidental images of vehicles. Proposed methodology has been applied for data set, and data have been divided into different training and testing ratios. The proposed MRBM model has an accuracy of 98% in classification of both accidental and nonaccidental images of vehicles. The proposed model outperforms the competition significantly than other in which they are compared like artificial neural network, support vector machine, and restricted Boltzmann machine techniques.

AB A major effort is put into the production of green energy as a countermeasure to climatic changes and sustainability. Thus, the energy industry is currently betting on offshore wind energy, using wind turbines with fixed and floating platforms. This technology can benefit greatly from interventive autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to assist in the maintenance and control of underwater structures. A wireless charger system can extend the time the AUV remains underwater, by allowing it to charge its batteries through a docking station. The present work details the development process of a housing component for a wireless charging system to be implemented in an AUV, addressed as wireless charger housing (WCH), from the concept stage to the final physical verification and operation stage. The wireless charger system prepared in this research aims to improve the longevity of the vehicle mission, without having to return to the surface, by enabling battery charging at a docking station. This product was designed following a design for excellence (DfX) and modular design philosophy, implementing visual scorecards to measure the success of certain design aspects. For an adequate choice of materials, the Ashby method was implemented. The structural performance of the prototypes was validated via a linear static finite element analysis (FEA). These prototypes were further physically verified in a hyperbaric chamber. Results showed that the application of FEA, together with well-defined design goals, enable the WCH optimisation while ensuring up to 75% power efficiency. This methodology produced a system capable of transmitting energy for underwater robotic applications.

AB This study offers an early glimpse of how individuals perceive the advantages/disadvantages of AVs, their mode-use intentions, and potential market segments with respect to mode use, should AVs eventually become the only way to travel by car. To do so, we implemented a statewide survey of Georgia residents (N = 2890) and using that data, we applied factor analyses to two blocks of AV-related statements. The first block measured 12 perceptions of AVs, and yielded two psychological constructs: AV pros (advantages/ benefits) and AV overuse cons (negative outcomes specifically associated with the excessive use of AVs). The second block of statements measured respondents' inclinations between AV and non-AV options for 12 hypothetical transportation "needs", and factor analysis identified four mode-use propensity constructs: AV(-inclined) over walk/bike, AV over flight, zero-occupant AV over occupied AV, and AV over transit. The main goal of the paper was to segment the sample on the basis of these four mode-use propensities, to identify clusters with similar propensity profiles or response vectors. We applied latent class cluster analysis to do so, and identified seven potential market segments: some preferring AV options in general, others preferring non-AV options or having unique propensity patterns based on certain contexts (e.g. long distance travel and vehicle occupancy). In the model, socio-demographics, geography, attitudes, and perceptions of AVs help characterize those market segments, and this provides a basis for deeper interpretation and consideration of policy implications.

AB We present a novel method for planning coverage paths for inspecting complex structures on the ocean floor using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Our method initially uses a 2.5-dimensional (2.5D) prior bathymetric map to plan a nominal coverage path that allows the AUV to pass its sensors over all points on the target area. The nominal path uses a standard mowing-the-lawn pattern in effectively planar regions, while in regions with substantial 3D relief it follows horizontal contours of the terrain at a given offset distance. We then go beyond previous approaches in the literature by considering the vehicle's state uncertainty rather than relying on the unrealistic assumption of an idealized path execution. Toward that end, we present a replanning algorithm based on a stochastic trajectory optimization that reshapes the nominal path to cope with the actual target structure perceived in situ. The replanning algorithm runs onboard the AUV in real time during the inspection mission, adapting the path according to the measurements provided by the vehicle's range-sensing sonars. Furthermore, we propose a pipeline of state-of-the-art surface reconstruction techniques we apply to the data acquired by the AUV to obtain 3D models of the inspected structures that show the benefits of our planning method for 3D mapping. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in experiments at sea using the GIRONA 500 AUV, where we cover part of a breakwater structure in a harbor and an underwater boulder rising from 40m up to 27m depth.

AB Autonomous mobile robots are usually faced with challenging situations when driving in complex environments. Namely, they have to recognize the static and dynamic obstacles, plan the driving path and execute their motion. For addressing the issue of perception and path planning, in this paper, we introduce OctoPath, which is an encoder-decoder deep neural network, trained in a self-supervised manner to predict the local optimal trajectory for the ego-vehicle. Using the discretization provided by a 3D octree environment model, our approach reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification problem with a configurable resolution. During training, OctoPath minimizes the error between the predicted and the manually driven trajectories in a given training dataset. This allows us to avoid the pitfall of regression-based trajectory estimation, in which there is an infinite state space for the output trajectory points. Environment sensing is performed using a 40-channel mechanical LiDAR sensor, fused with an inertial measurement unit and wheels odometry for state estimation. The experiments are performed both in simulation and real-life, using our own developed GridSim simulator and RovisLab's Autonomous Mobile Test Unit platform. We evaluate the predictions of OctoPath in different driving scenarios, both indoor and outdoor, while benchmarking our system against a baseline hybrid A-Star algorithm and a regression-based supervised learning method, as well as against a CNN learning-based optimal path planning method.

AB An environment-aware millimeter wave radar (EMWR) is one of the most important sensors in an autonomous driving system. With the increasing penetration of an EMWR on an autonomous vehicle, the possibility of radar interference increases accordingly. Interference may seriously affect the detection performance of an EMWR. When the transmitted signals from other EMWRs are received by the EMWR on an autonomous vehicle, the accuracy of target detection will be affected, which may affect the environment-aware performance. Therefore, more and more attention is paid to how to restrain the interference between EMWR signals. Radar interference can be divided into two types: same-frequency interference (SFI) and different-frequency interference (DFI). In this paper, an anti-DFI algorithm of an EMWR is proposed. Firstly, the causes and signal characteristics of DFI are analyzed. Secondly, the signal amplitude is obtained via Hilbert transform to locate the interference according to the signal characteristics. Then, the Lagrange interpolation based on empirical-mode decomposition (EMD) is used to reconstruct the interference signal to reduce the influence of DFI. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed algorithm is verified by the simulation results. The simulation results validate that the interference signal after EMD filtering and Lagrange interpolation can repair the interference region and achieve the purpose of anti-DFI.

AB Oil spills caused by accidents from oil tankers and blowouts of oil and gas from offshore platforms cause tremendous damage to the environment as well as to marine and human life. To prevent oil and gas accidentally released from deep water from spreading and causing further damage over time to the environment, early detection and monitoring systems can be deployed to the area where underwater releases of oil and gas first occurred. Monitoring systems can provide a rapid inspection of the area by detecting chemical substances and collecting oceanography data necessary for enhancing the accuracy of simulation of behavior of oil and gas. An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) called the Spilled Oil and Gas Tracking Autonomous Buoy system (SOTAB-I) is being developed to perform onsite measurements of oceanographic data as well as dissolved chemical substances using underwater mass spectrometry. The scope of this paper is limited to the surveying abilities of SOTAB-I in shallow water, although it also has functions for surveying in deep water. The experiment results obtained during the early deployments of SOTAB-I in the shallow water of the Gulf of Mexico in the United States are provided. Oceanographic data, such as the water column distribution of temperature, salinity, and density, as well as the dissolution of chemical substances were measured. In addition, a high-resolution water current profile was obtainable near the seabed.

AB This paper addresses formation control of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles in three-dimensional space, using a hybrid protocol that combines aspects of centralized and decentralized control with constraints that are particular to underwater vehicles, including switching topologies, unmeasurable velocities, and system constraints. Using a distributed leader-follower model, the hybrid formation protocol does not require velocity sensing, access to global information, or static and connected topologies. To handle switching jointly connected networks-that is, to tolerate temporary disconnections-a distributed observer is designed for followers to cooperatively estimate leader states using local measurements and local interactions. On this basis, a compound formation control strategy is proposed to achieve geometric convergence. Firstly, cascaded extended state observers are developed to recover the unmeasurable velocities and unknown dynamic uncertainties induced by internal model uncertainty and external disturbances. Secondly, an improved three-dimensional line-of-sight guidance law at the kinematic level is used to address the underactuated configuration and the nonzero attack and sideslip angles. Thirdly, to overcome potential instability as a result of system constraints, including velocity constraints and input saturations, two adaptive compensators in the dynamic controller are used to address the negative effects of truncation. Using the proposed approach, the estimation errors and formation tracking errors are proved to be uniformly and ultimately bounded. Additionally, the numerical simulation results verify the performance of the approach and demonstrate improvement over both distributed and centralized state-of-the-art approaches.(c) 2022 ISA.

AB Maintaining situation awareness (SA) is essential for drivers to deal with the situations that Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Level 3 automated vehicle systems are not designed to handle. Although advanced physiological sensors can enable continuous SA assessments, previous single-modality approaches may not be sufficient to capture SA. To address this limitation, the current study demonstrates a multimodal sensing approach for objective SA monitoring. Physiological sensor data from electroencephalogram and eye-tracking were recorded for 30 participants as they performed three secondary tasks during automated driving scenarios that consisted of a pre-takeover (pre-TOR) request segment and a post-TOR segment. The tasks varied in terms of how visual attention was allocated in the pre-TOR segment. In the post-TOR segment, drivers were expected to gather information from the driving environment in preparation for a vehicle-to-driver transition. Participants' ground-truth SA level was measured using the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Techniques (SAGAT) after the post-TOR segment. A total of 23 physiological features were extracted from the post-TOR segment to train computational intelligence models. Results compared the performance of five different classifiers, the ground-truth labeling strategies, and the features included in the model. Overall, the proposed neural network model outperformed other machine learning models and achieved the best classification accuracy (90.6%). A model with 11 features was optimal. In addition, the multi-physiological sensor-model outperformed the single sensing model by comparing prediction performance. Our results suggest that multimodal sensing model can objectively predict SA. The results of this study provide new insight into how physiological features contribute to the SA assessment.

AB The current planning and operational analysis tools utilised by researchers and practitioners for transportation facilities evaluation purposes are limited in their relevance to evaluate the future impact of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Since CAV technologies are becoming more prevalent on the market, the adaptation of the conventional methodologies to estimate highway performance is becoming essential to accommodate these technologies. This study tries to fill up this gap in the literature by formulating capacity analysis model estimate the potential impacts of CAVs on the capacity of highways at different market penetration (MP) levels of CAVs. The developed analytical model would present itself as a guideline to transportation agencies while developing CAV-based transportation infrastructure. Later, this study proposes an agent-based modelling and simulation framework to address the heterogeneity of drivers behaviour and the potential impact of CAVs on highway traffic performance under different MP levels. Results showed that deploying CAVs in the traffic stream has the potential to double the capacity of the highway corridor at high MP levels. The results show CAV operation and implementation readiness for both public agencies as well as state Departments of Transportation or private industries in the future.

AB For use in on-road scenarios, many driver assistance systems have reached series-production readiness or are close to doing so. But if the environment changes to off-road, the users' requirements and especially the environment's parameters demand other assistance and autonomy functions. In this article we present some functionalities developed by our institute which can decrease the driver's cognitive load in those off-road scenarios: The convoy assist enables precise following of other vehicles in nearly all environments, and the mule assist helps move load between two camps. The scenarios of the M-ELROB 2016 robotics competition are used for evaluation.

TI Communication Between Automated Vehicles and Drivers in Manual Driving
   Vehicles: Using a Mechanical Arm to Produce Gestures
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; DESIGN; SYSTEM
AB Effective communication between automated vehicles and human drivers in manual driving vehicles is of great importance for traffic safety during the transition phase of automated vehicles. Gestures, which were widely used in road users' communication, were promising in conveying the intentions of automated vehicles naturally and intuitively without extra learning costs. However, the effect of gestures in conveying the automated vehicles' intentions on human understanding remains unknown. This study proposed the idea of adopting mechanical arms to produce gestures. An experiment based on video recordings was conducted to explore the effect of arms type (slow-waved mechanical arm (80 beats/min) vs. fast waved mechanical arm (120 beats/min) vs. human arm) and gesture type (taking the road vs. giving the road) on the participants' objective responses and subjective opinions. A total of 30 participants were recruited as human drivers in a manual driving vehicle, who received and responded to the gestures transferred by an encountering automated vehicle. Results indicated that regardless of the gesture type, the slow-waved mechanical arm led to a longer response time (mean +/- SD: 4.871 +/- 0.947 s) and lower response accuracy (88.3 +/- 32.4%) when compared with the human arm (response time: 4.457 +/- 0.727 s, response accuracy: 95.0 +/- 22.0%). It was also rated less understandable and comfortable than the human arm. Nevertheless, the fast-waved mechanical arm not only exerted as fast (4.484 +/- 0.818 s) and accurate responses (98.3 +/- 12.9%) as the human arm but was also rated as understandable, polite, and comfortable as the human arm. This indicated the implication of conveying gestures by utilizing the fast-waved mechanical arm (120 beats/min) to facilitate effective communication from automated vehicles to human drivers in manual driving vehicles. The present study's findings provided reference implications for manufacturers and designers to adopt this gesture-based communication method to develop safe and user-friendly automated vehicles.

AB The droop control strategies can realise an autonomous power allocation among virtual synchronous generators (VSGs) that can provide the recompenses of reduced system complexity and enhanced reliability. The stability of a low-inertia microgrid can be improved by implementing a VSG, designed for the coordination between multiple variable electric vehicle (EV) based charging loads. This study mainly investigates two control schemes. Firstly, the instantaneous contribution from EV charging control for any disturbance that can provide adequate damping and inertia to a low-inertia microgrid without degradation of the battery. Secondly, the adjustment ofQ-Vdroop control is suggested by correcting the excitation voltage of a VSG. This method can reduce the influence of line impedances and power ratings on reactive power sharing in a multi-VSGs system. Additionally, four different active and reactive power control modes of VSG are discussed to emphasise EV charging and discharging control through the VSG controller. These modes are explained through circuit and vector diagrams in direct and quadratic coordinates. The efficacy of the proposed strategies and their influence on power sharing is theoretically demonstrated and analysed. Finally, the theoretical results are validated through extensive simulation and experimental verification.

AB Traditional indoor facility inspections on pipelines and boilers are conducted manually and can be logistically challenging, labor-intensive, costly, and dangerous for the inspectors. With the maturity of unmanned technology, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is becoming a promising alternative to the problematic manual inspection. However, due to the lack of GPS signal indoor, the localization of UAVs is a big challenge to achieve fully autonomous inspection. Moreover, the narrow and complex indoor environment makes it difficult to guarantee flight safety. This paper presents a UAV-based explore-then-exploit system to tackle these problems for autonomous indoor facility data collection and scene reconstruction. The proposed system consists of a hardware description and integration of two UAVs, a two-step simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) method for UAV localization and 3D environmental mapping, a safety-guaranteed coverage path planning algorithm for inspection and data collection, as well as an obstacle-aware trajectory generation method. The proposed system is examined in GPS-denied and cluttered indoor environment and 3D scene reconstruction is conducted. The quantitative analysis shows that the positioning accuracy is centimeter -level and the reconstruction error is within 3 cm. The performance analysis demonstrates the robustness and feasibility of our system in reconstructing and inspecting complex indoor environments for high-efficiency and low-cost facility management.

AB Objective: Autonomous emergency braking (AEB) acts to slow down a vehicle when an unavoidable impending collision is detected. In addition to documented benefits when applied to passenger cars, AEB has also shown potential when applied to motorcycles (MAEB). However, the feasibility of MAEB as practically applied to motorcycles in the real world is not well understood.Methods: In this study we performed a field trial involving 16 riders on a test motorcycle subjected to automatic decelerations, thus simulating MAEB activation. The tests were conducted along a rectilinear path at nominal speed of 40km/h and with mean deceleration of 0.15 g (15% of full braking) deployed at random times. Riders were also exposed to one final undeclared brake activation with the aim of providing genuinely unexpected automatic braking events.Results: Participants were consistently able to manage automatic decelerations of the vehicle with minor to moderate effort. Results of undeclared activations were consistent with those of standard runs.Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility of a moderate automatic deceleration in a scenario of motorcycle travelling in a straight path, supporting the notion that the application of AEB on motorcycles is practicable. Furthermore, the proposed field trial can be used as a reference for future regulation or consumer tests in order to address safety and acceptability of unexpected automatic decelerations on a motorcycle.

AB In this paper, we present a novel autonomous vehicle (AV) localization design and its implementation, which we recommend to employ in challenging navigation conditions with a poor quality of the satellite navigation system signals and computer vision images. In the case when the GPS signal becomes unstable, other auxiliary navigation systems, such as computer-vision-based positioning, are employed for more accurate localization and mapping. However, the quality of data obtained from AV's sensors might be deteriorated by the extreme environmental conditions too, which infinitely leads to the decrease in navigation performance. To verify our computer-vision-based localization system design, we considered the Arctic region use case, which poses additional challenges for the AV's navigation and might employ artificial visual landmarks for improving the localization quality, which we used for the computer vision training. We further enhanced our data by applying affine transformations to increase its diversity. We selected YOLOv4 image detection architecture for our system design, as it demonstrated the highest performance in our experiments. For the computational platform, we employed a Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier device, as it is well known and widely used in robotic and AV computer vision, as well as deep learning applications. Our empirical study showed that the proposed computer vision system that was further trained on the dataset enhanced by affine transformations became robust regarding image quality degradation caused by extreme environmental conditions. It was effectively able to detect and recognize images of artificial visual landmarks captured in the extreme Arctic region's conditions. The developed system can be integrated into vehicle navigation facilities to improve their effectiveness and efficiency and to prevent possible navigation performance deterioration.

AB The rapid development of connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology and the outperformance of the managed lane have drawn increasing attention with respect to wonder whether the CAV operating in the managed lane is helpful. Therefore, this study focuses on the methodology applied to explore whether the managed lane is beneficial in the gradual application of CAVs. Three managed lanes are considered, namely a bus lane, CAV dedicated lane, and high-occupancy vehicle lane. Given the unfamiliarity with the travel mode related to CAVs, the attitudinal variables for CAVs and their influencing relationship are designed and quantified by a structural equation model based on the extended technology acceptance model. A two-level nested logit model with different types of managed lanes as explanatory variables is further developed to analyze the travel choice of traditional modes and CAV modes. The difference in probabilities of travel choices under managed lanes is also explored. The results indicate that the three managed lanes have a positive influence on promoting the adoption of the CAV modes, with an increase of at least 13.5% shifted from traditional modes in the conventional lane. Moreover, the influences of managed lanes differ between transit CAVs and non-transit CAVs. The probabilities of choosing transit CAVs under three managed lanes increase in the range of 12.9%-27.2%, while those of non-transit CAVs only show a maximum 6.5% increase in the CAV dedicated lane. The study is expected to assist in designing differentiated development of CAVs with the deployment of managed lanes.

AB Mechanical Scanning Sonars (MSS) are popular devices for Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV), i.e., Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV), as they function under low visibility conditions and over extended ranges. They are comparatively low-cost and easy to integrate. But they require motion-compensation due to the low updates rates caused by the mechanical scanning and the slow speed of sound. We present here a new form of scan formation for MSS where the data from single beams is embedded into a pose-graph. The rendering of scans is not as usual based on only core navigation sensors, but it can improve in the spirit of a synthetic aperture. To this end, online Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is used to form scans from the single beams. These can be optimized and improved scans in turn lead to improved registration results in subsequent steps. This Synthetic Scan Formation (SSF) leads to better mapping results than state-of-the-art SLAM with MSS. The method is validated with several real-world experiments. First, different trajectories with precise ground-truth in a pool with a gantry set-up are used. Second, results from field trials in a WW-II submarine bunker are presented. It is shown that there are clear quantitative and qualitative improvements, and that SSF can be used in real-time for mapping during a mission.

AB Even entirely driverless vehicles will sometimes require remote human intervention. Existing SA frameworks do not acknowledge the significant human factors challenges unique to a driver in charge of a vehicle that they are not physically occupying. Remote operators will have to build up a mental model of the remote environment facilitated by monitor view and video feed. We took a novel approach to "freeze and probe" techniques to measure SA, employing a qualitative verbal elicitation task to uncover what people "see" in a remote scene when they are not constrained by rigid questioning. Participants (n = 10) watched eight videos of driving scenes randomized and counterbalanced across four road types (motorway, rural, residential and A road). Participants recorded spoken descriptions when each video stopped, detailing what was happening (SA Comprehension) and what could happen next (SA Prediction). Participant transcripts provided a rich catalog of verbal data reflecting clear interactions between different SA levels. This suggests that acquiring SA in remote scenes is a flexible and fluctuating process of combining comprehension and prediction globally rather than serially, in contrast to what has sometimes been implied by previous SA methodologies (Jones and Endsley, 1996; Endsley, 2000, 2017b). Inductive thematic analysis was used to categorize participants' responses into a taxonomy aimed at capturing the key elements of people's reported SA for videos of driving situations. We suggest that existing theories of SA need to be more sensitively applied to remote driving contexts such as remote operators of autonomous vehicles.

AB The transportation industries forecast that by 2050 more than 50% of vehicles on the road will be autonomous vehicles, and automotive services will dynamically support all vehicles. All of them will be serviced using the latest technology, which includes the Software Defined Network (SDN) and available new generations (5G+ or 6G) at the time. Although many transportation services and rapid facilities are achievable dynamically, transportation services with automation and intelligent actions are still not mature because the legacy of transport services cannot be corporate with the 5G+. These expected problems can be improved through the following possible and manageable approaches: flexible framework of 5G automotive services from the legacy systems, designing energy-efficient and intelligent infrastructures with SDN, and managing security solutions that evolve with the emerging technology. An efficient model (flexible framework) is proposed to secure smart transportation services with a secure and intelligent connected system and security solutions based on the 5G concept. Although 5G is considered in this framework, the method and steps of design and solution phases will be adaptable to the 5G+ framework. Furthermore, the basic properties of SDN allowed us to design a novel approach for measuring data traffic related to transport services and transport management, such as the priority of the transportation services. With the emergence of 5G+ capabilities, transportation services expect more challenges through future user requirements, including dynamic security solutions, minimum latency, maximum energy efficiency (EE), etc. Future automotive services depend on many sensors and their messages received through secure communication systems with 5G+ capabilities. As a result, this theoretical model will prove that 5G capabilities provide security facilities, better latency, and EE within the transportation system. Moreover, this model can be extendable to improve the 5G+ transportation services.</p>

AB Hybrid-driven underwater glider is a new type of unmanned underwater vehicle, which combines the advantages of autonomous underwater vehicles and traditional underwater gliders. The autonomous underwater vehicles have good maneuverability and can travel with a high speed, while the traditional underwater gliders are highlighted by low power consumption, long voyage, long endurance and good stealth characteristics. The hybrid-driven underwater gliders can realize variable motion profiles by their own buoyancy-driven and propeller propulsion systems. Stability of the mechanical system determines the performance of the system. In this paper, the Petrel-II hybrid-driven underwater glider developed by Tianjin University is selected as the research object and the stability of hybrid-driven underwater glider unitedly controlled by buoyancy and propeller has been targeted and evidenced. The dimensionless equations of the hybrid-driven underwater glider are obtained when the propeller is working. Then, the steady speed and steady glide path angle under steady-state motion have also been achieved. The steady-state operating conditions can be calculated when the hybrid-driven underwater glider reaches the desired steady-state motion. And the steadystate operating conditions are relatively conservative at the lower bound of the velocity range compared with the range of the velocity derived from the method of the composite Lyapunov function. By calculating the hydrodynamic coefficients of the Petrel-II hybrid-driven underwater glider, the simulation analysis has been conducted. In addition, the results of the field trials conducted in the South China Sea and the Danjiangkou Reservoir of China have been presented to illustrate the validity of the analysis and simulation, and to show the feasibility of the method of the composite Lyapunov function which verifies the stability of the Petrel-II hybrid-driven underwater glider.

AB The active scene flow estimation technology aims at higher quality of scene flow data through actively changing the ego-vehicle's trajectory as well as sensor observation position. The major challenges for active 3D point cloud scene flow estimation for autonomous driving (AD) include mis-registrations of point cloud frames, inaccurate scene prediction, and inefficient scene similarity evaluation. This paper presents a framework of active scene flow estimation for AD applications, which consists of three main modules: robust scene flow estimation, reliable reachable area detection, and efficient observation position decision. The novelty of this work is threefold: 1) developing a robust bi-direction attention-based mechanism neural network scene flow estimation method; 2) developing a reliable reachable area detection strategy through hidden points removing (HPR) based scene prediction and a legality checking scheme between the ego-vehicle and the road as well as the predicted scene; 3) developing an efficient observation position decision strategy through building a scene similarity measure, which can help evaluate the differences between two frames of point clouds from different views. The proposed method is trained and verified using a CARLA simulator based dataset, the FlyingThings3D and KiTTI datasets, which have the accurate scene flow ground-truth. The experiment results demonstrate the superior estimation performance and generalization capacity of our method for various AD scenes as well as different system configurations, compared with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

AB Background Automated Vehicles (AVs) are central to the new mobility paradigm that promises to transform transportation systems and cities across the globe. To date, much of the research on AVs has focused on technological advancements with little emphasis on how this emerging technology will impact population-level health. This scoping study examines the potential health impacts of AVs based on the existing literature. Methods Using Arksey and O'Malley's scoping protocol, we searched academic and 'grey' literature to anticipate the effects of AVs on human health. Results Our search captured 43 information sources that discussed a least one of the five thematic areas related to health. The bulk of the evidence is related to road safety (n = 37), followed by a relatively equal distribution between social equity (n = 24), environment (n = 22), lifestyle (n = 20), and built environment (n = 18) themes. There is general agreement that AVs will improve road safety overall, thus reducing injuries and fatalities from human errors in operating motorized vehicles. However, the relationships with air quality, physical activity, and stress, among other health factors may be more complex. The broader health implications of AVs will be dependent on how the technology is adopted in various transportation systems. Regulatory action will be a significant determinant of how AVs could affect health, as well as how AVs influence social and environmental determinants of health. Conclusion To support researchers and practitioners considering the health implications of AVs, we provide a conceptual map of the direct and indirect linkages between AV use and health outcomes. It is important that stakeholders, including public health agencies work to ensure that population health outcomes and equitable distribution of health impacts are priority considerations as regulators develop their response to AVs. We recommend that public health and transportation officials actively monitor trends in AV introduction and adoption, regulators focus on protecting human health and safety in AV implementation, and researchers work to expand the body of evidence surrounding AVs and population health.

AB We propose a novel semi-autonomous teleoperation control framework for two nonholonomic wheeled mobile robots, which are cooperatively grasping and transporting a deformable object without any physical grip-enforcing fixture and are teleoperated by a single remote human user via a first-person view camera attached on the over-seeing wheeled mobile robot with some visuo-haptic feedback. First, we apply nonholonomic passive decomposition to split the kinematics of the two wheeled mobile robots into the grasping/first-person view-centering behavior and the teleoperation-related behavior. We reveal that, under a mixed constraint of the system (i.e. physical/nonholonomic no-slip/drift constraint and artificial/holonomic grasping/first-person view-centering constraint), the first-person view camera cannot track an arbitrary human command. We then design the semi-autonomous control architecture, consisting of an autonomous grasping-enforcing and first-person view-centering control and a first-person view camera teleoperation control, which in turns stands upon autonomous human command tracking control. We also design visual and haptic feedback to notify the user of, and also nudge them to reduce, the command-behavior mismatch caused by the mixed constraint, which is difficult for the user to understand via the limited first-person view, we can thus induce user confusion/frustration and consequently performance deterioration. Experiment verification and a human subject study are performed to show the efficacy of our proposed first-person view semi-autonomous teleoperation framework with the visuo-haptic feedback.

AB Without public support, the deployment of Automated Vehicles (AVs) is doomed to failure. Therefore, their acceptability has been widely studied. On the basis of a systematic literature review of 113 empirical studies, the present paper studies the influence of the modes of contact with the AV (no explanation provided, written or pictorial description only, simulator, real experience) on sociodemographic variables, acceptability, behavioural intention and their determinants. The analysis of the dependent variables shows a lack of clarification of what is actually measured and a heterogeneity of measurements that makes comparisons difficult. The determinants were separated in two groups: preferences, which refer to projections in use, and perceptions, which refer to beliefs. The determinants in the preferences group, and some determinants in the perceptions group (perceived ease of use and usefulness and attitudes), are not influenced by the mode of contact with the AV. Indeed, a more concrete mode of contact does not change the participants' responses for these variables. For the other determinants of the perceptions group, the mode of contact with AVs impacts participants' responses. Trust and perceived safety are influenced by the mode of contact. More significantly, we observed that the relationship between acceptability and the level of knowledge or control was moderated by the mode of contact with AVs. These results lead us to encourage research favouring direct experience with the AV to study its acceptability. A discussion of these recurring results but also the significant methodological and theoretical shortcomings highlighted by the review is presented such as the research gaps in terms of sampling or statistical robustness. In conclusion, a few methodological approaches are proposed for the study of technological devices that are little or not known to future users, as well as a reflection on the usefulness of studying the acceptability of these little-known devices.

AB Autonomous aerial refueling is a key enabling technology for both manned and unmanned aircraft where extended flight duration or range are required. The results presented within this paper offer one potential vision-based sensing solution, together with a unique test environment. A hierarchical visual tracking algorithm based on direct methods is proposed and developed for the purposes of tracking a drogue during the capture stage of autonomous aerial refueling, and of estimating its 3D position. Intended to be applied in real time to a video stream from a single monocular camera mounted on the receiver aircraft, the algorithm is shown to be highly robust, and capable of tracking large, rapid drogue motions within the frame of reference. The proposed strategy has been tested using a complex robotic testbed and with actual flight hardware consisting of a full size probe and drogue. Results show that the vision tracking algorithm can detect and track the drogue at real-time frame rates of more than thirty frames per second, obtaining a robust position estimation even with strong motions and multiple occlusions of the drogue.

AB Path tracking control of intelligent vehicles has to deal with the difficulties of model uncertainties and nonlinearities. As a class of adaptive optimal control methods, reinforcement learning (RL) has received increasing attention in solving difficult control problems. However, feature representation and online learning ability are two major problems to be solved for learning control of uncertain dynamic systems. In this article, we propose a multi-kernel online RL approach for path tracking control of intelligent vehicles. In the proposed approach, a multiple kernel feature learning framework is designed for online learning control based on dual heuristic programming (DHP) and the new online learning control algorithm is called multi-kernel DHP (MKDHP). In MKDHP, instead of the expert knowledge for selecting and fine-tuning of a suitable kernel function, only a set of basic kernel functions is required to be predefined and the multi-kernel features can be learned for value function approximation in the critic. The simulation studies on path tracking control for intelligent vehicles have been conducted under S-curve and urban road conditions. The results demonstrated that compared with other typical path tracking controllers for intelligent vehicles, such as the linear quadratic regulator (LQR), the pure pursuit controller and the ribbon-based controller, the proposed multi-kernel learning controller can achieve better performance in terms of tracking precision and smoothness.

AB We study the collaborative transport planning for two autonomous business units of Fritom, a Dutch logistics service provider. This difficult planning problem does not fit any existing type of vehicle routing problem proposed in the academic literature; therefore, we define a new problem class, the generalized pickup and delivery problem. We also propose and evaluate methods to structure and improve Fritom's existing collaborative transport planning process. Using an extensive real-world data set from Fritom, our experiments show that our proposed methods significantly outperform Fritom's collaborative planning approach in total travel distance. We formulate managerial recommendations for Fritom and describe the implementation process for these recommendations. Finally, we present several recommendations for future research.

ID AERIAL
AB This letter introduces a small hybrid aerial underwater vehicle (HAUV), which we named Nezha-F, that can fly in the air, perform vertical profiling underwater, and vertically take off and land from both the water surface and ground. A foldable and self-deployable arm mechanism linked to and driven by a piston variable buoyancy system (PVBS) is proposed to reduce the excessive underwater drag caused by aerial structures. By having a compact size and successfully balanced aerial and underwater performance without adding excessive actuators, this design provides a feasible idea for the miniaturization of amphibious floats. The dynamic characteristics of the small PVBS are linear fitted, and modeled. The originally nonlinear actuator performance is linearized by the post-fitting mapping. Asymmetric dead zones of the actuator are removed by adding compensation to the algorithm. During a 10-day field test, the vehicle showed good aerial performance and underwater control effect. Several full mission cycle tests proved the vehicle's ability in semi-autonomous operation and robust domain crossing and verified the vehicle's endurance during each mission stage.

TI On Dynamic Vehicle Routing With Time Constraints
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Autonomous agents; motion planning; service robots; vehicle routing
AB We consider the problem of dynamic vehicle routing under exact-time constraints on servicing demands. Demands are sequentially generated in an environment, and every demand needs to be serviced exactly after a fixed finite interval of time after it is generated. We design routing policies for a service vehicle to maximize the fraction of demands serviced at steady state. The main contributions are as follows. First, we demonstrate that this problem is described by an appropriate directed acyclic graph structure which leads to a computationally efficient routing algorithm based on a longest-path computation. Second, under the assumption of the demands being generated uniformly randomly in the environment and via a Poisson process in time, we provide two analytic lower bounds on the service fraction of the longest path policy. The first bound is relative to an optimal noncausal version of the policy, i.e., a policy based on knowledge of all future demand requests. The second bound is an explicit function of the vehicle dynamics and demand generation rate and, therefore, useful as a design tool. Finally, we present numerical results to support the analytic bounds.

ID OMNIDIRECTIONAL VISION; UAV
AB Almost all autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles are used for reconnaissance and intelligence gathering roles. This means that cameras, video transmitters, and/or video recorders are already integrated in the system and are part of the unmanned aerial vehicle payload. Current attitude estimation sensors are expensive, heavy, and consume more power than most micro aerial vehicles can tolerate. Vision-based attitude estimation can be used to augment inertial sensors for increased accuracy, or as primary pitch and roll sensing resulting in reduced vehicle cost, size, and weight. This paper presents a fast, real-time algorithm to estimate pitch and roll angles for an aerial vehicle from video frames captured using a downward-pointing camera with a mounted fisheye lens. The fisheye lens is installed to ensure the visibility of most of the earth's horizon at sufficient altitudes. Attitude angles are estimated by the horizontal and vertical movement of the horizon circle, which moves in relation to the center of the video frame image. The system was tested and implemented on a radio controlled plane and the results proved to be successful with over 85% of the results within +/- 3 degrees when compared to a traditional inertial measurement unit.

AB Connected and automated vehicle technologies provide an opportunity for a more efficient distribution of traffic in urban networks through cooperative routing behavior. Controlling the route choice of a proportion of autonomous vehicles (AVs) to establish the system optimum (SO) condition has already been investigated in static networks. This study aims to develop a timedependent optimal ratio control scheme (TORCS) in which an optimal ratio of AVs is identified and selected to seek SO routing. The objective of the control scheme is to achieve a reasonable compromise between the system efficiency (i.e., total travel time savings) and the control cost that is proportional to the total distance traveled by SO-seeking AVs. The proposed distance-based TORCS is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem. A mixed equilibrium simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment model (SBDTA) estimates time-dependent mixed traffic patterns in the lower level based on the time-dependent optimal ratios of SO-seeking AVs obtained from the upper level. We also introduce a new concept of frequency control within the TORCS application. The frequency-based TORCS enables the central agent to control the route choice of selected AVs only in the time periods with the most significant impact on system travel time reduction. This is formulated with a binary variable within the TORCS problem indicating an action/no action regarding controlling AVs at a given assignment interval. The applicability of the model is demonstrated on a real large-scale network of Melbourne, Australia.

AB An increase in autonomous vehicles (AVs) would result in a decline in traffic congestion; however, the travel cost associated with AVs is always higher than that of manually-driven vehicles (MV). This situation is interpreted as a so-called multi-player social dilemma. This study designed an economic experiment to investigate the effect of AVs on mode choice in mixed traffic flows. Participants were informed about the cost function in both modes and were asked to choose the travel mode for more than 60 rounds. In full information (FI) treatment, participants received information about the travel costs of the AV and MV modes at the end of each round. In the partial information (PI) treatment, participants received information only about the travel cost of the mode they chose. We found that participants were sensitive to cost differences in the FI treatments. Based on inequality aversion models, we proposed a perceived cost that could better explain the experimental equilibrium. A monetary reward was provided to encourage participants to take AVs and solve social dilemmas. The results demonstrated that the reward mechanism reduces traffic congestion and increases social benefits, especially in the FI treatment. Finally, a learning model that considers inertia and perceived cost is proposed to explain the decision making process of the participants during the experiment. The findings have implications for traffic forecasting in the mixed flow of MVs and AVs and provide insights and policy suggestions for AV management.

TI Secure Automated Valet Parking: A Privacy-Preserving Reservation Scheme

ID SIGNATURE
AB It is believed that automated valet parking (AVP) system has great potential to mitigate the parking headache for the future smart city, as it can provide on-demand parking services, bringing immense benefits from energy saving for vehicles to time saving for drivers. For an AVP system, parking reservation is an indispensable part so that vehicles can accomplish automated parking in accordance with the reserved parking information. However, the reservation requests may not only reveal the driver identity, but also disclose higher sensitive locations, e.g., the most visited places, which are of great concerns to users. To deal with this challenge, the anonymous techniques can be naturally applied during parking reservation, but directly applying the anonymous techniques in AVP will introduce a new security issue, i.e., the anonymous user may maliciously crash the AVP system by repetitively sending the reservation requests, which is called "double-reservation attack." In this paper, we propose a new privacy-preserving reservation scheme for securing AVP system. Specifically, each anonymous user must have only one valid reservation token at any moment, and the token can only be used for hooking one vacant parking space once. The proposed scheme does not only preserve the user's identity privacy and location privacy but also prevents the "double-reservation attack" based on several elegant building blocks, i.e., zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge and proxy resignature. Detailed security analysis confirms the security properties of our proposed scheme. In addition, extensive simulations are conducted to compare our proposed scheme with three previous schemes, and the experiment results demonstrate that our scheme is also much efficient in a WiFi-based testbed.

AB The autonomous vehicles (AV) industry has a growing demand for reliable, continuous, and accurate positioning information to ensure safe traffic and for other various applications. Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers have been widely used for this purpose. However, GNSS positioning accuracy deteriorates drastically in challenging environments such as urban environments and downtown cores. Therefore, inertial sensors are widely deployed inside the land vehicle for various purposes, including the integration with GNSS receivers to provide positioning information that can bridge potential GNSS failures. However, in dense urban areas and downtown cores where GNSS receivers may incur prolonged outages, the integrated positioning solution may become prone to severe drift resulting in substantial position errors. Therefore, it is becoming necessary to include other sensors and systems that can be available in future land vehicles to be integrated with both the GNSS receivers and inertial sensors to enhance the positioning performance in such challenging environments. This work aims to design and examine the performance of a multi-sensor system that fuses the GNSS receiver data with not only the three-dimensional reduced inertial sensor system (3D-RISS), but also with the three-dimensional point cloud of onboard light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system. In this paper, a comprehensive LiDAR processing and odometry method is developed to provide a continuous and reliable positioning solution. In addition, a multi-sensor Extended Kalman filtering (EKF)-based fusion is developed to integrate the LiDAR positioning information with both GNSS and 3D-RISS and utilize the LiDAR updates to limit the drift in the positioning solution, even in challenging or ultimately denied GNSS environment. The performance of the proposed positioning solution is examined using several road test trajectories in both Kingston and Toronto downtown areas involving different vehicle dynamics and driving scenarios. The proposed solution provided a performance improvement over the standalone inertial solution by 64%. Over a GNSS outage of 10 min and 2 km distance traveled, our solution achieved position errors less than 2% of the distance travelled.

AB As an indispensable branch of machine learning (ML), reinforcement learning (RL) plays a prominent role in the decision-making process of autonomous driving (AD), which enables autonomous vehicles (AVs) to learn an optimal driving strategy through continuous interaction with the environment. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based motion planning strategy for AD tasks in the highway scenarios where an AV merges into two-lane road traffic flow and realizes the lane changing (LC) maneuvers. We integrate the DRL model into the AD system relying on the end-to-end learning method. An improved DRL algorithm based on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is developed with well-defined reward functions. In particular, safety rules (SR), safety prediction (SP) module and trauma memory (TM) as well as the dynamic potential-based reward shaping (DPBRS) function are adopted to further enhance safety and accelerate learning of the LC behavior. For validation, the proposed DSSTD algorithm is trained and tested on the dual-computer co-simulation platform. The comparative experimental results show that our proposal outperforms other benchmark algorithms in both driving safety and efficiency.

AB Mobile robots are designed to perform different tasks in many different fields such as production, fast delivery, defence industry and space exploration. Advances in mobile robots are crucial as they can perform tasks that are difficult, dangerous or inefficient for humans. In this context, we discuss the improvement of velocity planning in the rapidly evolving field of autonomous mobile robots. In this study, we focus on mobile robots with high variance in their weight. Mobile robots can transport loads or autonomous personal transportation vehicles such as wheelchairs, which can be given as an example of these types of systems. This study focuses specifically on linear velocity planning for providing the same performance for all payloads on the mobile robot considering comfort and safety. For this aim, we propose a new velocity planning method based on fuzzy logic which has several advantages over previous methods. The suggested algorithm is tested in simulations using certain performance measurement metrics. After the observation of successful results, real-world experimental tests are performed to prove the real-time applicability of the proposed approach.

AB We propose a framework for cooperative search using a combination of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Such a combination allows search platforms to adapt to changes in both mission objectives and environmental parameters. We propose three strategies for coordination between an UAV and AUV to maximize the area explored while minimizing the idle time of the UAV and AUV. We evaluate the efficacy of these strategies while varying the speed, communication range and the number of targets. Preliminary results suggest the feasibility of our approach to combine UAVs and AUVs for effectively searching a given area.

AB This paper studies the visibility maintenance problem (VMP) for a leader-follower pair of Dubins-like vehicles with input constraints and proposes an original solution based on the notion of controlled invariance. The nonlinear model describing the relative dynamics of the vehicles is interpreted as a linear uncertain system, with the leader robot acting as an external disturbance. The VMP is then reformulated as a linear constrained regulation problem with additive disturbances (DLCRP). Positive D-invariance conditions for linear uncertain systems with parametric disturbance matrix are introduced and used to solve the VMP when box bounds on the state, control input and disturbance are considered. The proposed design procedure can be easily adapted to more general scenarios. Simulation results illustrate the theory and show the effectiveness of our approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper describes a prototype of a full-view spherical image sensor, gives a method for sensor calibration, and discusses display modalities of the captured full-view image for monitoring around a vehicle. To monitor the whole surrounding situation of a dynamic environment by a single camera, a spherical field of view (FOV) is divided into two hemispherical views. Each hemispherical FOV is imaged by a fisheye lens. Both of the hemispherical views are fused by a mirror to acquire them on a single image plane. To calibrate the full-view spherical image sensor, a three-dimensional (3-D) calibration pattern is used to compute the internal parameters of each fisheye lens and their relative orientation based upon a spherical camera model. Finally, several display modalities are discussed to show drivers the relevant spherical image information on planar displays for monitoring around a vehicle.

AB This paper addresses real-time implementation of the simultaneous localization and map-building (SLAM) algorithm. It presents optimal algorithms that consider the special form of the matrices and a new compressed filter that can significantly reduce the computation requirements when working in local areas or with high frequency external sensors. It is shown that by extending the standard Kalman filter models the information gained in a local area can be maintained with a cost similar to O(Na-alpha(2)), where Na-alpha is the number of landmarks in the local area, and then transferred to the overall map in only one iteration at full SLAM computational cost. Additional simplifications are also presented that are very close to optimal when an appropriate map representation is used. Finally the algorithms are validated with experimental results obtained with a standard vehicle running in a completely unstructured outdoor environment.

TI Optical Attitude Determination from Horizon Orientation Using Image
   Segmentation
SO JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Images from cameras onboard an aircraft or spacecraft frequently contain a wealth of information that may be exploited for navigation and other purposes. One feature that may be used for aircraft navigation in many situations is the orientation of the horizon. If the area around which the vehicle is flying is known to have little local topography, then the orientation of the observed horizon in a camera image may be used to estimate vehicle pitch and roll. This paper presents a new approach for detecting the horizon based on image segmentation along with a detailed discussion of the optimality of the segmentation result. The technique developed here is a contributing algorithm to the miniature autonomous flight testbed.

TI Evaluating Collaborative and Autonomous Agents in Data-Stream-Supported

DT Article
DE crowdsourcing; data stream learning; multiagent systems; collaborative
   coordination; market-based coordination
AB Mobile crowdsourcing refers to systems where the completion of tasks necessarily requires physical movement of crowdworkers in an on-demand workforce. Evidence suggests that in such systems, tasks often get assigned to crowdworkers who struggle to complete those tasks successfully, resulting in high failure rates and low service quality. A promising solution to ensure higher quality of service is to continuously adapt the assignment and respond to failure-causing events by transferring tasks to better-suited workers who use different routes or vehicles. However, implementing task transfers in mobile crowdsourcing is difficult because workers are autonomous and may reject transfer requests. Moreover, task outcomes are uncertain and need to be predicted. In this paper, we propose different mechanisms to achieve outcome prediction and task coordination in mobile crowdsourcing. First, we analyze different data stream learning approaches for the prediction of task outcomes. Second, based on the suggested prediction model, we propose and evaluate two different approaches for task coordination with different degrees of autonomy: an opportunistic approach for crowdshipping with collaborative, but non-autonomous workers, and a market-based model with autonomous workers for crowdsensing.

AB Autonomous driving can obtain accurate perception and reliable motion prediction with the support of multi-modal fusion. Recently, there has been growing interest in leveraging features from various onboard sensors to enhance the primary stages of autonomous driving. This paper proposes LiCaNext to capture additional accuracy advancements in joint perception and motion prediction while maintaining real-time requirements. LiCaNext is the next version of LiCaNet, which fuses LIDAR data in both bird's-eye view (BEV) and range view (RV) representations with a camera image. In contrast to LiCaNet, we introduce sequential range residual images into the multi-modal fusion network to further improve performance, with minimal increase in inference time. Employing sequential range residual images has a substantial direct impact on motion prediction and positively influences perception. We provide an extensive evaluation on the public nuScenes dataset. Our experiments show that incorporating sequential range residuals secures significant performance gain, with monotonic progress for a larger number of exploited residuals.

AB We introduce the KAIST multi-spectral data set, which covers a great range of drivable regions, from urban to residential, for autonomous systems. Our data set provides the different perspectives of the world captured in coarse time slots (day and night), in addition to fine time slots (sunrise, morning, afternoon, sunset, night, and dawn). For all-day perception of autonomous systems, we propose the use of a different spectral sensor, i.e., a thermal imaging camera. Toward this goal, we develop a multi-sensor platform, which supports the use of a co-aligned RGB/Thermal camera, RGB stereo, 3-D LiDAR, and inertial sensors (GPS/IMU) and a related calibration technique. We design a wide range of visual perception tasks including the object detection, drivable region detection, localization, image enhancement, depth estimation, and colorization using a single/multi-spectral approach. In this paper, we provide a description of our benchmark with the recording platform, data format, development toolkits, and lessons about the progress of capturing data sets.

AB This paper presents a framework for navigating in obstacle-dense environments as posed in the 2016 International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) Autonomous Drone Racing Challenge. Our framework is based on direct visual servoing and leg-by-leg planning to navigate in a complex environment filled with many similar frame-shaped obstacles to fly through. Our indoor navigation method relies on the velocity measurement by an optical flow sensor since the position measurements from GPS or external cameras are not available. For precision navigation through a sequence of obstacles, a center point-matching method is used with the depth information from the onboard stereo camera. The guidance points is directly generated in three-dimensional space using the two-dimensional image data to avoid accumulating the error from the sensor drift. The proposed framework is implemented on a quadrotor-based aerial vehicle, which carries an onboard vision-processing computer for self-contained operation. Using the proposed method, our drone was able to finished in first place in the world-premier IROS Autonomous Drone Racing Challenge.

AB Cities around the world are expanding dramatically, with urban population growth reaching nearly 2.5 billion people in urban areas and road traffic growth exceeding 1.2 billion cars by 2050. The economic contribution of the transport sector represents 5% of the GDP in Europe and casts an average of US $482.05 billion in the United States. These figures indicate the rapid rise of industrial cities and the urgent need to move from traditional cities to smart cities. This article provides a survey of different approaches and technologies such as intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that leverage communication technologies to help maintain road users safe while driving, as well as support autonomous mobility through the optimization of control systems. The role of ITS is strengthened when combined with accurate artificial intelligence models that are built to optimize urban planning, analyze crowd behavior and predict traffic conditions. AI-driven ITS is becoming possible thanks to the existence of a large volume of mobility data generated by billions of users through their use of new technologies and online social media. The optimization of urban planning enhances vehicle routing capabilities and solves traffic congestion problems, as discussed in this paper. From an ecological perspective, we discuss the measures and incentives provided to foster the use of mobility systems. We also underline the role of the political will in promoting open data in the transport sector, considered as an essential ingredient for developing technological solutions necessary for cities to become healthier and more sustainable.

AB Many studies in the field of robot navigation have focused on environment representation and localization. The goal of map representation is to summarize spatial information in topological and geometrical abstracts. By providing strong priors, maps improve the performance and reliability of automated robots. Due to the transition to fully automated driving in recent years, there has been a constant effort to design methods and technologies to improve the precision of road participants and the environment's information. Among these efforts is the high-definition (HD) map concept. Making HD maps requires accuracy, completeness, verifiability, and extensibility. Because of the complexity of HD mapping, it is currently expensive and difficult to implement, particularly in an urban environment. In an urban traffic system, the road model is at least a map with sets of roads, lanes, and lane markers. While more research is being dedicated to mapping and localization, a comprehensive review of the various types of map representation is still required. This paper presents a brief overview of map representation, followed by a detailed literature review of HD maps for automated vehicles. The current state of autonomous vehicle (AV) mapping is encouraging, the field has matured to a point where detailed maps of complex environments are built in real time and have been proved useful. Many existing techniques are robust to noise and can cope with a large range of environments. Nevertheless, there are still open problems for future research. AV mapping will continue to be a highly active research area essential to the goal of achieving full autonomy.

TI Optimization-Based Traffic Safety Improvement Strategy for Autonomous

AB Railway level crossings pose a serious threat to the safety and mobility of drivers traversing them. Globally, a significant number of traffic violations occur annually at level crossings. This study proposes an optimization-based autonomous vehicle (AV) driving strategy to improve the traffic safety of AVs at level crossings. First, an optimization model considering the operational constraints is developed. The cost function of the proposed optimization-based driving strategy is the time difference between the time required by the train to reach the level crossing and the time taken by the AV to complete the whole crossing maneuver. Second, a MATLAB simulation model is developed to validate the proposed driving strategy. Simulation results show that the proposed driving strategy delivers optimized AV driving without stoppage. The comparative study also shows that the proposed method improves driving performance. For instance, when a train is 1 m away from the light signal while the AV's initial speed is 36 km/h, the time required for the AV to reach the speed limit sign is about 0.44 s, while the time required by the train to reach the car block area is 0.13 s. Thus, the AV is forced to stop and then go after the train leaves the level crossing. Contrary to this, the proposed method allows a safe passage of the vehicle within 1.66 s without stoppage. Most importantly, the driving strategy is a collision avoidance strategy without unnecessary enforcement of stop-and-go when AVs have the chance of crossing safely. Consequently, the optimization-based driving strategy both improves traffic safety and reduces traveling time.

ID AUTOMATIC GUIDANCE; SYSTEM
AB There is an increasing trend in Japan towards consolidating, and thus enlarging, paddy fields. Because this demands more efficient operations, the authors developed an automated six-row rice transplanter. It employs a real-time kinematic global positioning system (RTKGPS) for precise positioning, fiber optic gyroscope (FOG) sensors to measure direction, and actuators to control steering, engine throttle, clutch, brake, etc. The RTKGPS achieves 2 cm precision at 10 Hz data output rate, and the FOG sensors are employed to maintain vehicle inclination. RTKGPS position data, influenced by vehicle inclination, are corrected by the FOG sensor data. FOG sensor drift is corrected by referring to the position data. To eliminate the influence of drift, deviation from the desired path, calculated from yaw angle and vehicle speed, is first compared with the deviation calculated using GPS data. Heading angle drift is then calculated. An experiment was conducted two days after flooding the field. The authors used a simple proportional steering controller. Root mean square deviation from the desired straight path after correcting for the yaw angle offset was approximately 5.5 cm at a speed of 0.7 m/s. The maximum deviation from the desired path is less than 12 cm which does not include the first 2 m after starting operation. Transplanting a 10 m x 50 m field was completed in 15 min. The autonomous operation was accurate enough for the rice transplanting. However, the authors could not obtain enough accuracy for spraying or mechanical weeding operations after rice transplanting because the vehicle must travel between the crop rows. For this to occur, it is necessary to improve the turn control algorithm and steering controller to obtain more precise operations. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A ground-based tracking camera and coaligned slitless spectrograph were used to measure the spectral signature of visible radiation emitted from the Hayabusa capsule as it entered into the Earth's atmosphere in June 2010. Good quality spectra were obtained, which showed the presence of radiation from the heat shield of the vehicle and the shock-heated air in front of the vehicle. An analysis of the blackbody nature of the radiation concluded that the peak average temperature of the surface was about (3100 +/- 100) K. Line spectra from oxygen and nitrogen atoms were used to infer a peak average shock-heated gas temperature of around (7000 +/- 400) K.

AB A conceptual design of an Earth return vehicle is presented with the goal of safely returning biological samples from orbit. Key entry, descent, and landing trade studies were completed at the conceptual level for two different mission scenarios: return from the International Space Station and an autonomous, free-flying vehicle returning from low Earth orbit. The analyses that follow for each key subsystem drove design decisions to create the Biopan Deployment in Orbit for Microgravity Exposure vehicle with the versatility to satisfy both of the aforementioned mission scenarios. The final design features a ballistic entry, a 45deg sphere-cone aeroshell with a diameter of 88cm, a phenolic impregnated carbon ablator heat shield with a thickness of 7.7cm, and a passive landing system containing an 8-m-diam ringsail parachute combined with a 7.8-cm-thick crushable carbon foam. Analysis of the vehicle performance verified survivability of biological samples due to heat and deceleration loads from entry. Trajectory dispersion analysis yielded crossrange and downrange limited to +/- 1.5 and +/- 30km, respectively, whereas landing velocity was confirmed to be 4.0m/s for all cases.

AB This paper proposes a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) scheme applicable to the autonomous navigation of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV). A SLAM scheme is an alternative navigation method for measuring the environment through which the vehicle in passing and providing the relative position of the unmanned vehicle. An unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is utilized in order to develop a SLAM that is suitable for estimating the locations of the UUV and the surrounding objects when the UUV's motion is highly nonlinear. A range sonar is used as a sensor for collecting the data of the spatial information of the environment in which the UUV navigates. The proposed UKF-SLAM scheme was tested in experiments that used various 3 degrees-of-freedom motion conditions with a real UUV under a tank environment. The results of these experiments showed that the proposed SLAM algorithm was capable of estimating the position of the UUV and the surrounding objects in real environments, and that the algorithm will perform well in various conditions.

ID SECURITY
AB When developing cyber-physical systems such as automated vehicles, safety and cybersecurity analyses are often conducted separately. However, unlike in the IT world, safety hazards and cybersecurity threats converge in cyber-physical systems; a malicious party can exploit cyber-threats to create extremely hazardous situations, whether in autonomous vehicles or nuclear plants. The authors propose a framework for integrated system-level analyses for functional safety and cybersecurity. They present a generic model named Threat Identification and Refinement for Cyber-Physical Systems (TIRCPS) extending Microsoft's six classes of threat modelling including Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial-of-Service and Elevation Privilege. TIRCPS introduces three benefits of developing complex systems: first, it allows the refinement of abstract threats into specific ones as physical design information becomes available. Second, the approach provides support for constructing attack trees with traceability from high-level goals and hazardous events (HEs) to threats. Third, TIRCPS formalises the definition of threats such that intelligent tools can be built to automatically detect most of a system's vulnerable components requiring protection. They present a case study on an automated-driving system to illustrate the proposed approach. The analysis results of a hierarchical attack tree with cyber-threats traceable to high-level HEs are used to design mitigation solutions.

TI Fuzzy Docking Guidance Using Augmented Navigation System on an AUV
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV); docking guidance; docking station;
   fuzzy; Kalman filtering; navigation
AB A fundamental successful docking operation requires the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to be able to guide, navigate, and control itself into the docking station in a strategic manner and even possibly execute different maneuvers at different mission phases, depending on docking scenario, requirements, and homing sensor type. A docking station, due to environmental or mission requirements, is possibly oriented at a specific direction instead of allowing omnidirectional homing, and necessitates vehicle docking in only this direction. Depending on the operating environment, either wave or current presence or both can result in a dominating disturbance to the vehicle docking operation. In this work, an inverted ultrashort baseline (USBL) system is used as the main homing sensor to complement the existing navigation suite on the DSO-developed AUV. A docking guidance system was designed and implemented using the Sugeno fuzzy inference system (FIS). A desired heading vector field and the fuzzy rules were developed to perform the fuzzy docking maneuver. An error-state Kalman filter (KF) was designed, formulated, and implemented successfully on the AUV and has proven to perform excellent relative positioning estimation in sea trials. A software architecture was designed for the docking algorithms, and implemented onto a single board computer in the AUV. A sensor fusion approach to the software programming was adopted to ensure that navigation data from all navigation sensors are properly acquired and synchronized. A docking station was designed and eventually deployed at sea for docking trials. Successful AUV docking attempts at sea trials were demonstrated, thus showing the effectiveness of the implemented docking algorithms.

TI Car-following strategy of intelligent connected vehicle using extended

DE adaptive system; autonomous vehicle; intelligent control
ID SYSTEMS; DESIGN
AB Disturbance observer-based control method has achieved good results in the car-following scenario of intelligent and connected vehicle (ICV). However, the gain of conventional extended disturbance observer (EDO)-based control method is usually set manually rather than adjusted adaptively according to real time traffic conditions, thus declining the car-following performance. To solve this problem, a car-following strategy of ICV using EDO adjusted by reinforcement learning is proposed. Different from the conventional method, the gain of proposed strategy can be adjusted by reinforcement learning to improve its estimation accuracy. Since the "equivalent disturbance" can be compensated by EDO to a great extent, the disturbance rejection ability of the car-following method will be improved significantly. Both Lyapunov approach and numerical simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB In this letter, we investigate the ergodic capacity of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based free space optics (FSO) links over random foggy channel. More specifically, we derive composite probability density function (PDF) and close approximation for the moments of the composite PDF using the statistical model of a UAV-based 3D pointing error and a random foggy channel. With it, we obtain upper bound and asymptotic approximation of the ergodic capacity for the two possible detection techniques of intensity modulation/direct detection (IM/DD) and heterodyne detection at high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. The numerical results confirm all the presented analytic results via computer-based Monte-Carlo simulations.

AB The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in delivery logistics has become an efficient solution with the advancement of autonomous robotics. This paper proposes a novel mechanism that synchronizes drones and delivery trucks; particularly the case where trucks can work as mobile launching and retrieval sites. The problem is a Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Synchronized Drones. A multi-objective optimization model is developed with two conflicting objectives, minimizing the travel costs and maximizing the customer service level in terms of timely deliveries. A novel Collaborative Pareto Ant Colony Optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the model and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is used to compare and validate the proposed algorithm. The experimental results indicate that the proposed mechanism is an efficient solution to parcel delivery logistics.

AB Aiming at the problems of unstable motion and low tracking accuracy caused by complex external disturbance during the movement of the remote operated vehicle(ROV), the adaptive control method and sliding mode control method are combined to propose a ROV adaptive sliding mode motion controller(ASM controller). The sliding mode surface is designed by exponential reaching law and saturation function to achieve rapid convergence of the control system and eliminate high-frequency buffeting, combined with adaptive algorithm to improve the anti-disturbance ability of the system, and the Lyapunov stability criterion is used to verify the controller's stability under uncertain parameters and unknown external disturbances. Simulation experiments show that the designed adaptive sliding mode controller has good maneuverability and tracking performance.

AB Accurate localization of a vehicle is a fundamental challenge and one of the most important tasks of mobile robots. For autonomous navigation, motion tracking, and obstacle detection and avoidance, a robot must maintain knowledge of its position over time. Vision-based odometry is a robust technique utilized for this purpose. It allows a vehicle to localize itself robustly by using only a stream of images captured by a camera attached to the vehicle. This paper presents a review of state-of-the-art visual odometry (VO) and its types, approaches, applications, and challenges. VO is compared with the most common localization sensors and techniques, such as inertial navigation systems, global positioning systems, and laser sensors. Several areas for future research are also highlighted.

AB This paper addresses the development of a vision-based target tracking system for a small unmanned air vehicle. The algorithm performs autonomous tracking of a moving target, while simultaneously estimating geographic coordinates, speed, and heading of the target. Tight real-time integration of unmanned air vehicle's video and telemetry data streams with georeferenced database allows for reliable target identification, increased precision, and shortened time of target motion estimation. A low-cost off-the-shelf system is used, with a modified radiocontrolled aircraft airframe, gas engine, and servos. Tracking is enabled using a low-cost, miniature pan-tilt gimbal. The control algorithm provides rapid target acquisition and tracking capability. A target motion estimator was designed and shown in multiple flight tests to provide reasonable targeting accuracy. The impact of tracking loss events on the control and estimation algorithms is analyzed in detail.

AB With the development of autonomous driving technology, designing connected automated vehicles (CAVs) control strategies to mitigate traffic oscillations has become a hot topic. Most current control strategies are mainly oriented to single-lane highway scenarios and do not consider vehicles' lane-changing behaviors. To address the gap, this paper proposes the Follower-Stopper-Platoon (FSP) strategy, which attempts to mitigate traffic oscillation by controlling a platoon of CAVs in a two-lane scenario. Firstly, based on the Follower-Stopper (FS) control and considering CAVs' platoon behaviors, this paper proposes the FSP strategy and compares it with two comparative strategies, the Baseline and FS strategies. Then, a two-lane mixed traffic flow cellular automata model is developed and used to verify the effectiveness of the FSP strategy. Finally, this study demonstrates the efficacy of the FSP strategy by designing simulation experiments and analyzes the effect of CAVs' platoon size on the control effect. The result shows that (1) the FSP strategy can overcome the shortcomings of the FS control and will increase traffic flow speed while mitigating traffic oscillations. (2) In a two-lane scenario, as penetration rates of CAVs and traffic densities increase, the FSP strategy's advantages in mitigating traffic oscillations, reducing energy consumption and pollutant emissions, and improving speed and passenger comfort are gradually apparent. (3) Under the FSP strategy, the larger the maximum size of the CAVs platoon, the better the performance of the mixed traffic flow in terms of traffic efficiency, stability, fuel consumption, and pollutant emission.

DE Task and motion planning; Hybrid systems; Autonomous vehicle; Starch;
   Motion planning; Behavior planning
AB To achieve optimal robot behavior in dynamic scenarios we need to consider complex dynamics in a predictive manner. In the vehicle dynamics community, it is well know that to achieve time-optimal driving on low friction surface, the vehicle should utilize drifting. Hence, many authors have devised rules to split circuits and employ drifting on some segments. These rules are suboptimal and do not generalize to arbitrary circuit shapes (e.g., S-like curves). So, the question "When to go into which mode and how to drive in it?" remains unanswered. To choose the suitable mode (discrete decision), the algorithm needs information about the feasibility of different modes (continuous motion). This makes it a class of Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) problems, which are known to be hard to solve optimally in real-time. In the AI planning community, search methods are commonly used. However, they cannot be directly applied to TAMP problems due to the continuous component. Here, we present a search-based method that effectively solves this problem and efficiently searches in a highly dimensional state space with nonlinear and unstable dynamics. The space of the possible trajectories is explored by sampling different combinations of motion primitives guided by the search. Our approach allows to use multiple locally approximated models to generate motion primitives (e.g., learned models of drifting) and effectively simplify the problem without losing accuracy. The algorithm performance is evaluated in simulated driving on a mixed-track with segments of different curvatures (right and left). Our code is available at https://git.io/JenvB.

AB This paper presents a flexible framework to simulate transport systems based on automated guided vehicles (AGVs). The framework used to perform the simulation also serves to implement the different policies and algorithms in the global control system. For all mobile platforms, regardless of their application, there is great interest in having the model in a simulation environment. However, transport systems tend to be complex, with many vehicles needing to execute many tasks at the same time. Furthermore, when analyzing the global control system, there is no need for a detailed simulation of each AGV. That is why most researchers do not use modular control frameworks, such as the robotic operating system (ROS), to simulate the global system. Instead, they use specific simulation tools that require the definition of the simulated scheduling, routing and allocation policies in specific languages or models. As an alternative, our approach extends the global control framework by replacing the on-board control modules and devices by an event simulator that models the AGV behavior statistically. With this approach, the control policies and methods are only implemented once; they are used and tested in simulation and later in the final system. Also, tasks are easily model and verified using a Petri Net-based model. This model is directly implemented in the executive module that coordinates all the other modules in the framework. This simulation framework has been used during the implementation of several projects which included an autonomous logistics system for hospitals, a warehouse internal transport system using autonomous forklifts, and a factory logistics transport system using tugger trains. Examples of how the simulation can help in the design of some parameters such as fleet size and scheduling policies are also included in the paper.

AB Precision Agriculture aims to apply selective treatments and tasks at localized areas concerning crop fields. Robotized and autonomous tractors, equipped with perception, decision-making and actuation systems, can apply specific treatments as may be required. Correct plant identification through the perception system, including crops and weeds, is an important issue. Additionally, it is well known that, in autonomous vehicles, safety is a major challenge, where unexpected obstacles in the working area must be conveniently addressed in order to guarantee the security and the continuity of the process. The objective of this study was to design a tri-class Support Vector Machine classifier for identifying plants (crops and weeds), soil and objects in maize fields based on unsupervised learning. For this, a strategy for automatic sample selection was designed to obtain elements of the three involved classes for the training process. In this context, the identification of obstacles for safe navigation makes an important contribution. A comparative analysis of different texture descriptors and local patterns was carried out with the aim of determining the best for characterizing the classes under study; results have shown that the Speeded-Up Robust Features descriptor is the most appropriate to discriminate between plants, soil and objects. The development of an object detection algorithm for agricultural images proved the effectiveness of the tri-class classifier with an accuracy of 94.3%.

AB Seafloor volcanic eruptions are difficult to directly observe due to lengthy eruption cycles and the remote location of mid-ocean ridges. Volcanic eruptions in 2005-2006 at 9 degrees 50 ' N on the East Pacific Rise have been well documented, but the lava volume and flow extent remain uncertain because of the limited near-bottom bathymetric data. We present near-bottom data collected during 19 autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) Sentry dives at 9 degrees 50 ' N in 2018, 2019, and 2021. The resulting 1 m-resolution bathymetric grid and 20 cm-resolution sidescan sonar images cover 115 km(2), and span the entire area of the 2005-2006 eruptions, including an 8 km(2) pre-eruption survey collected with AUV ABE in 2001. Pre- and post-eruption surveys, combined with sidescan sonar images and seismo-acoustic impulsive events recorded during the eruptions, are used to quantify the lava flow extent and to estimate changes in seafloor depth caused by lava emplacement. During the 2005-2006 eruptions, lava flowed up to similar to 3 km away from the axial summit trough, covering an area of similar to 20.8 km(2); similar to 50% larger than previously thought. Where pre- and post-eruption surveys overlap, individual flow lobes can be resolved, confirming that lava thickness varies from similar to 1 to 10 m, and increases with distance from eruptive fissures. The resulting lava volume estimate indicates that similar to 57% of the melt extracted from the axial melt lens probably remained in the subsurface as dikes. These observations provide insights into recharge cycles in the subsurface magma system, and are a baseline for studying future eruptions at the 9 degrees 50 ' N area.

DE forward-looking sonar; object detection; underwater fishing net;

AB Underwater fishing nets represent a danger faced by autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). To avoid irreparable damage to the AUV caused by fishing nets, the AUV needs to be able to identify and locate them autonomously and avoid them in advance. Whether the AUV can avoid fishing nets successfully depends on the accuracy and efficiency of detection. In this paper, we propose an object detection multiple receptive field network (MRF-Net), which is used to recognize and locate fishing nets using forward-looking sonar (FLS) images. The proposed architecture is a center-point-based detector, which uses a novel encoder-decoder structure to extract features and predict the center points and bounding box size. In addition, to reduce the interference of reverberation and speckle noises in the FLS image, we used a series of preprocessing operations to reduce the noises. We trained and tested the network with data collected in the sea using a Gemini 720i multi-beam forward-looking sonar and compared it with state-of-the-art networks for object detection. In order to further prove that our detector can be applied to the actual detection task, we also carried out the experiment of detecting and avoiding fishing nets in real-time in the sea with the embedded single board computer (SBC) module and the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier embedded system of the AUV platform in our lab. The experimental results show that in terms of computational complexity, inference time, and prediction accuracy, MRF-Net is better than state-of-the-art networks. In addition, our fishing net avoidance experiment results indicate that the detection results of MRF-Net can support the accurate operation of the later obstacle avoidance algorithm.

AB UAV-assisted wireless power transfer D2D networks have great potential to improve flexibility, spectrum efficiency and lifetime of future wireless networks. We consider an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless powered device-to-device (D2D) wireless communication network in the presence of ground and flying eavesdroppers. We design optimization algorithms to allocate the resources of the network and maximize the secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) by optimizing energy harvesting time and power allocation. The effectiveness and viability of proposed algorithms are illustrated through numerical simulations.

AB Advanced light detecting and ranging (LIDAR) sensors are the primary sensing modality for autonomous vehicles and are seeing increasing adoption in consumer and commercial vehicles for robust advanced driver assist systems. LIDAR returns from the environment are typically predicted using elastic LIDAR models, which can help emulate the performance of LIDAR sensors in environments with multiple returns or heavy obscurants. We derive the first elastic LIDAR model for a random modulated continuous wave LIDAR system using a homodyne receiver and show good agreement with experimental measurements.

AB The paper introduces a new bidirectional microscopic inviscid Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) model that uses only spacing information from the preceding and following vehicles in order to select the proper control action to avoid collisions and maintain a desired speed. KL estimates that guarantee uniform convergence of the ACC model to the set of equilibria are provided. Moreover, the corresponding macroscopic model is derived, consisting of a conservation equation and a momentum equation that contains a nonlinear relaxation term. It is shown that, if the density is sufficiently small, then the macroscopic model has a solution that approaches exponentially the equilibrium speed (in the sup norm) while the density converges exponentially to a traveling wave. Numerical simulations are also provided, illustrating the properties of the microscopic and macroscopic inviscid ACC models.

AB This paper presents a method for integrating data acquired by unmanned surface vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles. The aim of this work was to create a uniform bathymetric surface extending to the shoreline. Such a body of water is usually characterized by ultra-shallow depths, which makes measurement impossible even with hydrographic autonomous vessels. Bathymetric data acquired by the photogrammetric method are, however, characterized by large errors with increasing depth. The presented method is based on processing of two data sets using a bathymetric reference surface and selection of points on the basis of generated masks. Numerical bathymetric models created by interpolation methods confirmed the usefulness of the concept adopted.

AB Autonomous vehicles enable the development of smart warehouses and smart factories with an increased visibility, flexibility and efficiency. Thus, effective and affordable localisation methods for indoor vehicles are attracting interest to implement real-time applications. This paper presents an Extended Kalman Smoother design to both localise a mobile agent and reconstruct its entire trajectory through a sensor-fusion employing the UHF-RFID passive technology. Extensive simulations are carried out by considering the smoother optimal-window length and the effect of missing measurements from reference tags. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted for different vehicle trajectories and for different linear and angular velocities to evaluate the method accuracy. Then, an experimental analysis with a unicycle wheeled robot is performed in real indoor scenario, showing a position and orientation root mean square errors of 15 cm, and 0.2 rad, respectively.

AB In this letter, we study the simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. Our goal is to maximize the sum rate of all users by jointly optimizing the STAR-RIS's beamforming vectors, the UAV's trajectory and power allocation. We decompose the formulated non-convex problem into three subproblems and solve them alternately to obtain the solution. Simulations show that: 1) the STAR-RIS achieves a higher sum rate than traditional RIS; 2) to exploit the benefits of STAR-RIS, the UAV's trajectory is closer to STAR-RIS than that of RIS; 3) the energy splitting for reflection and transmission highly depends on the real-time trajectory of UAV.

AB The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in scenarios with limited or no infrastructure can provide services for mobile devices flexibly. This letter investigates the UAV transmission energy minimization problem with high data rate and reliability requirements in a UAV-based Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) network. Considering that the formulated problem is a non-convex problem, we decompose the original problem into two subproblems: (i) joint subcarrier allocation and modulation mode selection subproblem, and (ii) UAV trajectory design subproblem. By solving these two subproblems, we propose the joint subcarrier allocation, modulation mode selection, and trajectory design (JSMT) algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed JSMT algorithm can efficiently reduce the transmission energy of the UAV while meeting high data rate and reliability requirements.

AB Automated vehicles (AV) have the potential to benefit our society. Providing explanations is one approach to facilitating AV trust by decreasing uncertainty about automated decision-making. However, it is not clear whether explanations are equally beneficial for drivers across age groups in terms of trust and anxiety. To examine this, we conducted a mixed-design experiment with 40 participants divided into three age groups (i.e., younger, middle-age, and older). Participants were presented with: (1) no explanation, or (2) explanation given before or (3) after the AV took action, or (4) explanation along with a request for permission to take action. Results highlight both commonalities and differences between age groups. These results have important implications in designing AV explanations and promoting trust.

AB This paper proposes an algorithm that will allow an autonomous aerial drone to approach and follow a steady or moving herd of cattle using only range measurements. The algorithm is also insensitive to the complexity of the herd's movement and the measurement noise. Once arrived at the herd of cattle, the aerial drone can follow it to a desired destination. The primary motivation for the development of this algorithm is to use simple, inexpensive and robust sensing hence range sensors. The algorithm does not depend on the accuracy of the range measurements, rather the rate of change of range measurements. The proposed method is based on sliding mode control which provides robustness. A mathematical analysis, simulations and experimental results with a real aerial drone are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB While multiple mechanisms for value creation from big data analytics (BDA) exist, their application in everyday life can create trade-offs, particularly in the context of service robotics where the dispersion of autonomous digital technologies creates potentials for data-driven efficiency gains. Attending to personal preferences in such contexts, increasingly vital for customer acceptance, may run counter to efficiency, thus constraining value creation and rendering efficiency-personalization trade-offs a key managerial challenge. For the case of autonomous vehicles (AVs), we formalize this trade-off and design a machine-learning approach to handle it by drawing on a unique dataset comprising 35,000 drives by 1,850 users. We consider the real-time dynamics and user interactions that affect the decisions of AVs and develop a model extension that allows for leveraging the properties of sharing business models to make better-informed decisions. Our study contributes to information systems (IS) AV research by providing an artifact that targets both efficiency and personalization of AV operations as well as the dynamic balance between the two. With the focus on everyday life contexts, our study points to the value of incorporating trade-offs between competing goals as well as human-centered perspectives in information systems designs for research on BDA value creation. For practitioners, our work provides a practical and generalizable approach to realize the potentials of service robots without risking customer acceptance.

AB This paper presents an experimental analysis of a nonlinear model predictive controller combined with an integral sliding mode control component and an explicit dead-time compensator applied to the closed-loop control of FlatFish, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The proposed strategy is composed of three control instances that can be integrated to deal with constraints, disturbances, and dead time. The integral sliding mode control instance is considered to attenuate unmeasured disturbance effects, the filtered Smith predictor component is used to compensate for the dead-time effect, and the model predictive control layer aims at systematically optimizing closed-loop performance with constraint satisfaction. The discussion highlights that any of these control layers can be either included or removed from the control chain, which depends on the challenges presented by the AUV problem. The benchmark for such evaluation is the original control chain of FlatFish, which is based on a P cascade controller. Experimental tests were performed with FlatFish in a saltwater tank located in Bremen, Germany, and showed the superior performance of the proposed system. The experimental results show that the proposed control chain may be effectively used to provide improved tracking performance as expected from theoretical analysis.

AB Motion estimation of surrounding objects is indispensable to any mobile machinery. The paper proposes a method to solve the estimation and reconstruction problem of dynamic objects with a mono camera. Using the relative camera motion and detected rigidly moving objects on the image, we estimate their movement up to a scale factor. Utilization priors about their moving direction are used to estimate the transformation, which maps the 3D object from the previous frame to the actual one. Our two-frame method works twice the speed or more as other methods using three frames or more for the estimation, and we do this without any constraints. We evaluate our method on various traffic scenarios of different autonomous driving datasets.

AB We propose an approach to navigation for an unmanned aerial vehicle based on finding elements of motion (EM) (linear and angular velocities) by processing the field of local velocities for the motion of an image taken by an onboard video camera. The field of velocities for the image motion, the so-called optical flow (OF), is a linear function of the EM, which allows to use it to find the latter and thus provides an additional way of navigation, which can be rather efficiently used for certain specific problems solved by an UAV in autonomous flight. In this work, we use an algorithm for computing the OF for a given motion of the vehicle (direct problem) and show how to reconstruct the motion of the vehicle by OF observations with methods of statistical estimation (inverse problem).

AB An energy-optimal coverage path planning algorithm is proposed for environment survey. First, 3D terrains are modelled by tensor product Bezier surfaces for a mesh representation. Then, a power estimator is derived to calculate the consumed energy for a piecewise spatial path. Based on the digital surface model, an energy consumption map is constructed for the whole area by means of a weighted directed graph. Finally, an energy-optimal path can be achieved through traversing the map by a genetic algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

AB This paper addresses the problem of autonomously maneuvering a miniature air vehicle (MAV) to follow a road using computer vision as the primary guidance sensor. We focus on low-altitude flight with the objective of maximizing the pixel density of the road in the image. The airframe is assumed to be a bank-to-turn fixed-wing MAV with a downward-looking strap-down camera. The road is identified in the image using HSV classification, flood-fill operations, and connected-component analysis. The main contribution of the paper is the derivation of explicit roll-angle and altitude-above-ground-level (AGL) constraints that guarantee that the road will remain in the footprint of the camera, assuming a flat earth. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through high fidelity simulation and through flight results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Specifically, we are interested in behaviors that facilitate the monitoring of organisms on a coral reef, and we present behaviors and interaction modes for a small underwater robot. In particular, we address some challenging issues arising from the underwater environment: visual processing, interactive communication with an underwater crew and, finally, orientation and motion of the vehicle through a hovering mode. The visual processing consists of target tracking using various techniques (color segmentation, color histogram and mean shift). Communication underwater is achieved through printed cards with robustly identifiable visual markers on them. Finally, the hovering gait developed for this vehicle relies on the planned motion of six flippers to generate the appropriate forces.

AB The paper presents a new methodology for the lateral control of autonomous vehicles. The proposed cascade structure realizes two main components: a model predictive control (MPC)-based outer loop and an internal model control (IMC) based inner loop. In the outer loop, a unique model predictive control is introduced that eliminates the tuning parameters of the system by introducing a hierarchical optimization system. Each cost function of the hierarchical optimization focuses on minimizing a physical phenomenon. The inner loop handles system dynamics and nonlinearities, providing a robust system against external disturbances and parameter changes. After presenting the proposed structure, proper comparisons were performed: firstly, to see the advantages of the tuning parameter-free method and secondly, to highlight the benefits of the IMC-based method. Finally, the whole system is compared to a reference controller, available in MatLab.

AB The intelligentization of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) has recently attracted intensive interest. Visual perception of the water scenes is critical for the autonomous navigation of USVs. In this paper, an adaptive semantic segmentation method is proposed to recognize the water scenes. A semantic segmentation network model is designed to classify each pixel of an image into water, land or sky. The segmentation result is refined by the conditional random field (CRF) method. It is further improved accordingly by referring to the superpixel map. A weight map is generated based on the prediction confidence. The network trains itself with the refined pseudo label and the weight map. A set of experiments were designed to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method exhibits excellent performance with few-shot learning and is quite adaptable to a new environment, very efficient for limited manual labeled data utilization.

AB Path planners, in which a hunter is required to chase after a moving target, are an important problem for robotic systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned underwater vehicles. This paper describes an incremental moving target path planning algorithm which leverages previous planning data to update the path in the case where the target moves. The algorithm in this paper addresses the need for a quick path-planner that can be used in an environment where the target is moving. The algorithm does this by sacrificing optimality in order to reduce the computational complexity of the problem. Examples show that the algorithm reduces the complexity of re-planning by approximately 12 times while only increasing path length taken by 1.5%. Analytical estimates of the best and worst case complexity of the algorithm were developed, and these estimates are validated with experimental data.

AB This paper deals with the position control of Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) without linear velocity measurements. We propose a multistage constructive procedure, exploiting the cascade property of the translational and rotational dynamics. More precisely, we consider the force as a virtual control input for the translational dynamics, from which we extract the required (desired) system attitude and thrust achieving the tracking objective. Thereafter, the control torque is designed to drive the actual attitude to the desired one. A nonlinear observer, as well as some instrumental auxiliary variables are used to obviate the need for the linear velocity. Global asymptotic stability of the overall closed loop system is achieved. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper considers the equations required to analyze the three-dimensional steady-state configuration of an underwater cable system. Both towed systems and autonomous remotely controlled systems are considered, and the equations used to simulate the cable configuration are given. A sea-buggy example, originally considered by De Zoysa in 1978, is given to demonstrate the solution of the resulting two-point boundary-value problem by a shooting method. The results correct those of Wang et al. in 1993. An example of a towed system using a stranded cable demonstrates the inclusion of cable lift. A simplified analysis of the dependence of the cable tension on the cable length is also given. The optimum length of cable required to product the minimum force on the vehicle is between three and six times the direct range of the vehicle from the ship, for a range of vehicle positions.

AB Heterogeneous robot teams offer significant advantages for exploration and navigation missions in unknown environments. Notably, the air-ground robot teams have superior efficiency due to their mixed abilities and shared sensor resources useful when completing missions. However, the high energy consumption and reduced payload capability of the vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aerial platforms limit the complete robot team's behavior. At some point in a mission, the aircraft needs to return to the base, land, and replenish its batteries. This task restricts the team to explore the environment in-depth and to work for longer durations. To solve this problem, we present an autonomous system for docking a VTOL-unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with a mobile manipulator. The central measurement-actuation unit consists of a robot manipulator mounted on a mobile platform with a visual sensor configured as an eye-in-hand device. The visual information is used to execute a stable UAV tracking to achieve air-ground robot contact firmly. This strategy allows the multirobot team to economize and potentially recover aircraft energy. It also enables the robust ground platform to protect and store the aircraft facilitating to continue the mission for a longer duration. The on-site autonomous docking can be initiated multiple times, allowing the team to explore larger areas and complete long-term missions. The proposed method has been tested in simulations and real environments with detailed experimental results.

ID CALIFORNIA CURRENT SYSTEM; NORTHERN MONTEREY BAY; THIN-LAYERS
AB Coastal upwelling occurs under the combined effect of wind stress and Earth's rotation. The nutrients carried up by upwelling have great impact on primary production and fisheries. For using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to investigate complex coastal upwelling ecosystems, we have developed algorithms for an AUV to autonomously distinguish between upwelling and stratified water columns based on the vertical temperature difference between shallow and deep depths, and to accurately detect an upwelling front based on the horizontal gradient of the vertical temperature difference in the water column. During a June 2011 experiment in Monterey Bay, California, the Dorado AUV flew on a transect from an upwelling shadow region (stratified water column), through an upwelling front, and into an upwelling water column. Running our algorithms, the AUV successfully classified the three distinct water types, accurately located the narrow front, and acquired targeted water samples from the three water types. Molecular analysis of the AUV-acquired water samples shows that mussels, calanoid copepods, and podoplean copepods were most abundant in the upwelling shadow region and nonexistent in the upwelling water column. Calanoid copepods were moderately abundant in the water samples collected from the upwelling front. These results are largely consistent with previous findings from zooplankton population surveys conducted with the Dorado AUV in Monterey Bay in 2009. The novel detecting and targeted sampling capabilities permit an AUV to autonomously conduct "surgical sampling" of a complex marine ecosystem.

AB Driving behavior modeling is of great importance for designing safe, smart, and personalized autonomous driving systems. In this paper, an internal reward function-based driving model that emulates the human's decision-making mechanism is utilized. To infer the reward function parameters from naturalistic human driving data, we propose a structural assumption about human driving behavior that focuses on discrete latent driving intentions. It converts the continuous behavior modeling problem to a discrete setting and thus makes maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) tractable to learn reward functions. Specifically, a polynomial trajectory sampler is adopted to generate candidate trajectories considering high-level intentions and approximate the partition function in the maximum entropy IRL framework. An environment model considering interactive behaviors among the ego and surrounding vehicles is built to better estimate the generated trajectories. The proposed method is applied to learn personalized reward functions for individual human drivers from the NGSIM highway driving dataset. The qualitative results demonstrate that the learned reward functions are able to explicitly express the preferences of different drivers and interpret their decisions. The quantitative results reveal that the learned reward functions are robust, which is manifested by only a marginal decline in proximity to the human driving trajectories when applying the reward function in the testing conditions. For the testing performance, the personalized modeling method outperforms the general modeling approach, significantly reducing the modeling errors in human likeness (a custom metric to gauge accuracy), and these two methods deliver better results compared to other baseline methods. Moreover, it is found that predicting the response actions of surrounding vehicles and incorporating their potential decelerations caused by the ego vehicle are critical in estimating the generated trajectories, and the accuracy of personalized planning using the learned reward functions relies on the accuracy of the forecasting model.

AB Advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs) and autonomous vehicles rely on different types of sensors, such as camera, radar, ultrasonic, and LiDAR, to sense the surrounding environment. Compared with the other types of sensors, millimeter-wave automotive radar has advantages in terms of cost and reliability under bad weather conditions (e.g., snow, rain, and fog) and does not suffer from light condition variations (e.g., darkness). Typical radar devices used in today's commercial vehicles with ADAS features produce sparse point clouds in low angular resolution with a limited number of antennas. In this article, we present a machine-learning-aided signal processing chain to suppress the radar imaging blur effect introduced by the phase migration in time-division multiplexing multiple-input multiple-output radar, to generate low-level high-resolution radar bird's-eye view (BEV) spectra with rich object's features. Compared with radar point clouds, there is no information loss in radar BEV spectra. We then propose a temporal-fusion distance-tolerant single-stage object detection network, termed as TDRadarNet, and an enhanced version, TDRadarNet+, to robustly detect vehicles in both long and short ranges on radar BEVs. We introduce a first-of-its-kind multimodel dataset, containing 14 800 frames of high-resolution low-level radar BEV spectra with synchronized stereo camera RGB images and 3-D LiDAR point clouds. Our dataset achieves 0.39-m range resolution and 1.2 degrees degree azimuth angular resolution with 100-m maximum detectable range. Moreover, we create a subdataset, the Doppler Unfolding dataset, containing 244 140 beam vectors extracted from the 3-D radar data cube. With extensive testing and evaluation, we demonstrate that our Doppler unfolding network achieves 93.46% Doppler unfolding accuracy. Compared to YOLOv7, a state-of-the-art image-based object detection network, TDRadarNet, achieves a 70.3% average precision (AP) for vehicle detection, demonstrating a 21.0% improvement; TDRadarNet+ achieves a 73.9% AP, showing a 24.6% improvement in performance.

AB The research on autonomous landing of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is well established. However, the research on autonomous deck landing using visual methods is relatively not so mature and many of them require the support of ground infrastructures. In order to reduce such dependencies, a ship landing guidance strategy based on on-board vision is studied. Considering the characteristics of the ship landing issue, we propose a three-phase landing scheme and a decision-making method to ensure landing safety is also studied. For improving the traditional two-dimensional (2D) optical-flow method, a three-dimensional (3D) velocity vector estimation method using image spherical optical flow is studied. Furthermore, a guidance law based on the tau theory is employed by only using the visual information of the line of sight to the target. In this phase, a trajectory-tracking controller is applied to generate the velocity commands of the UAV. Finally, the whole algorithm is validated by simulation in different wave conditions developed with Unity3D. Compared with traditional trajectory planning methods, our method does not require complex optimization iterations and can meet both the real-time and accuracy requirements of deck landing. The average tracking error of our method maintains in 0.2 m. Moreover, the whole algorithm runs efficiently at around 30 fps on a Raspberry-Pi 3B+ microcomputer which meets the real-time requirements.

ID RECOGNITION
AB For autonomous vehicles, it is critical to be aware of the driving environment to avoid collisions and drive safely. The recent evolution of convolutional neural networks has contributed significantly to accelerating the development of object detection techniques that enable autonomous vehicles to handle rapid changes in various driving environments. However, collisions in an autonomous driving environment can still occur due to undetected obstacles and various perception problems, particularly occlusion. Thus, we propose a robust object detection algorithm for environments in which objects are truncated or occluded by employing RGB image and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) bird's eye view (BEV) representations. This structure combines independent detection results obtained in parallel through "you only look once" networks using an RGB image and a height map converted from the BEV representations of LiDAR's point cloud data (PCD). The region proposal of an object is determined via non-maximum suppression, which suppresses the bounding boxes of adjacent regions. A performance evaluation of the proposed scheme was performed using the KITTI vision benchmark suite dataset. The results demonstrate the detection accuracy in the case of integration of PCD BEV representations is superior to when only an RGB camera is used. In addition, robustness is improved by significantly enhancing detection accuracy even when the target objects are partially occluded when viewed from the front, which demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional RGB-based model.

ID MOBILE; MECHANICS
AB This paper investigates a framework of real-time formation of autonomous vehicles by using potential field and variational integrator. Real-time formation requires vehicles to have coordinated motion and efficient computation. Interactions described by potential field can meet the former requirement which results in a nonlinear system. Stability analysis of such nonlinear system is difficult. Our methodology of stability analysis is discussed in error dynamic system. Transformation of coordinates from inertial frame to body frame can help the stability analysis focus on the structure instead of particular coordinates. Then, the Jacobian of reduced system can be calculated. It can be proved that the formation is stable at the equilibrium point of error dynamic system with the effect of damping force. For consideration of calculation, variational integrator is introduced. It is equivalent to solving algebraic equations. Forced Euler-Lagrange equation in discrete expression is used to construct a forced variational integrator for vehicles in potential field and obstacle environment. By applying forced variational integrator on computation of vehicles' motion, real-time formation of vehicles in obstacle environment can be implemented. Algorithm based on forced variational integrator is designed for a leader-follower formation.

AB Testing algorithms with real cars is a mandatory step in developing new intelligent abilities for future transportation systems. However, this step is sometimes hard to accomplish especially due to several problems. It is also difficult to reproduce the same scenario several times. Besides, some critical and/or real world forbidden scenarios cannot be tested. Thus, the comparison of several algorithms using the same experimental conditions is hard to realize. Considering that, it seems important to use simulation tools to perform scenarios with realistic conditions. The main problem with these tools is their distance from real conditions, since they deeply simplify the reality. This paper presents the architecture of the simulation/prototyping tool named Virtual Intelligent Vehicle Urban Simulator (VIVUS). The goal of VIVUS is thus to overcome the general drawbacks of classical solutions by providing the possibility of designing a vehicle virtual prototype with simulated embedded sensors and physical properties. Experiments made on linear platoon algorithms are exposed in this paper in order to illustrate the similarities between simulated results and those obtained with real cars. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper describes the estimation of hydrodynamic coefficients and the control algorithm based on a nonlinear mathematical modeling for a test bed autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) named by SNUUV I (Seoul National University Underwater Vehicle 1).
   A six degree of freedom mathematical model for SNUUV I is derived with linear and nonlinear hydrodynamic coefficients, which are estimated with the help of a potential code and also the system identification using multi-variable regression.
   A navigation algorithm is developed using three ranging sonars, pressure sensor and two inclinometers keeping towing tank applications in mind. Based on the mathematical model, a simulation program using a model-based control algorithm is designed for heading control and wall following control of SNUUV I.
   It is demonstrated numerically that the navigation system together with controller guides the vehicle to follow the desired heading and path with a sufficient accuracy. Therefore the model-based control algorithm can be designed efficiently using the system identification method based on vehicle motion experiments with the appropriate navigation system.

AB Neural networks are examined for use as optimal controllers. The effect of the addition of noise to the neural network input measurements is investigated to determine the performance robustness of the neural network controllers. These techniques are applied to the autonomous control of interceptor-to target rendezvous missions. For this example, the target lies in a circular orbit and remains passive throughout the maneuver. The linearized Clohessy-Wiltshire equations with thrust are used to describe the relative motion of the two vehicles. Parameter optimization is used to generate the training data for the neural network designs. A combination of open-loop and closed-loop control. is shown to work effectively for this problem.

AB A concept called Combined Alternate-Direction Lane Assignment and Reservation-based Intersection Control (CADLARIC) was recently proposed for better management of directionally unrestricted traffic flows in a Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) environment. In CADLARIC, vehicles must position themselves in a proper lane before they reach the downstream intersection, which enables the resolution of vehicular conflicts both between intersections and, as traditionally, within the intersection boxes. CADLARIC has shown very promising results, but it is quite infrastructurally demanding, requiring six lanes per intersection approach. To overcome this problem, we propose here Combined Flexible Lane Assignment and Reservation-based Intersection Control (CFLARIC), a more robust concept that offers a full spectrum of lane assignment possibilities in combination with the appropriate reservation-based intersection control. Three distinctive CFLARIC strategies are tested on a simulated three-intersection corridor from West Valley City, Utah. The efficiency and safety performance of the proposed CFLARIC scenarios are evaluated through a comparison with Fixed-Time Control (FTC) and Full Reservation-based Intersection Control (FRIC), both with conventional lane assignments. The results illustrate that CFLARIC scenarios: (i) outperform FTC and FRIC in terms of efficiency (delay and number of stops), and (ii) improve overall safety (by reducing a number of conflicting situations) when compared to FRIC. The findings of this study prove that flexible control concepts such as CFLARIC have a great potential to improve safety and efficiency in future CAV environment. Future research needs to define under which conditions and how the proposed concept could be partially implemented in field operations.

AB We consider a mission-driven multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs) network with millimeter-wave (mmWave) transmissions, where a leader UAV (LUAV) communicates with a large number of follower UAVs (FUAVs) simultaneously via a uniform planar array with only a limited number of radio frequency chains. Since only a few orthogonal beams are available and mission-driven UAV networks are autonomous and delay-sensitive, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) over these beams is considered for agility and efficiency. In particular, aiming to address these challenges of highly dynamic mobility, we propose a machine learning framework to enable agile analog beam management for mmWave-NOMA transmissions. The proposed beam management aims to achieve efficient beam tracking and NOMA-grouping-aware analog beamforming optimization to facilitate mmWave-NOMA transmissions by judiciously utilizing angular domain information (ADI). More specifically, a Gaussian process machine learning-based ADI prediction scheme is proposed to track the angular dynamics of FUAVs, which facilitates fast beam-tracking for mmWave-NOMA transmissions. Moreover, by exploiting the predicted ADI, an unsupervised-learning-based FUAV grouping scheme is proposed to facilitate mmWave-NOMA transmissions with high radio-frequency chain efficiency, while a deep learning-based NOMA-grouping-aware fast transmit beamforming optimization scheme is proposed to improve the coverage of mmWave-NOMA transmissions in highly dynamic multi-UAVs networks. Simulation results validate the performance advantages of our proposed beam management scheme against state-of-the-art schemes.

That is, digital technologies could fundamentally transform how people and goods are moved, with significant impacts on transport demand and on the related energy consumption and environmental impacts. This article proposes a scenario analysis for the future of European passenger transport, by evaluating the potential effects of digitalization on mobility demand, energy consumption and CO2 emissions under different assumptions. The analysis illustrates that the penetration of digital technologies can lead to opposite effects with regard to both energy consumption and emissions. Two opposite scenarios are compared, to evaluate the effects of a "responsible" digitalization, in the direction of a sustainable mobility, against a "selfish" digitalization, where the final users maximize their utility. The likelihood of these two possible pathways is related to multiple drivers, including users' behavior, economic conditions and transport and environmental policies. Results show the variability range of the potential effects on energy consumption and CO2 emissions in Europe by 2030 and 2050, by considering digitalization trends including Mobility as a Service, Shared Mobility and Autonomous Vehicles. The variability of key parameters is evaluated in a dedicated sensitivity analysis, where the effects of electric vehicles, electricity generation mixes and vehicles' efficiency improvements are assessed. The article concludes that in order to fully exploit the advantages of digitalization, proper policies are needed to support an efficient and effective deployment of available technologies through an optimized and shared use of alternative transport options.

AB This paper presents the detailed modeling and simulation of the dynamic coupling between an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and a manipulator. The modeling processes are described with the incorporation of the most dominating hydrodynamic effects such as added mass, lift and drag forces. The hydrodynamic coefficients are derived using strip theory and are adjusted according to dynamical similarity. A fuzzy decoupling controller (FDC) is proposed for an autonomous underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) which consists of two subsystems, an underwater vehicle and a manipulator. The proposed controller uses a fuzzy algorithm (FA) to adaptively tune the gain matrix of the error function (EF). The EF is described by the integral sliding surface function. This technique allows the off-diagonal elements developed for decoupling the system to be incorporated in the gain matrix. Tracing the FA and EF back to the principle of feedback linearization, one further obtains evidence about the decoupling and stability of the system. Moreover, a desired trajectory with the consideration of the dynamic coupling of the AUV is designed to reduce the thruster forces and manipulator's torques. This technique provides high performance in terms of tracking error norms and expended energy norms. A major contribution of this study is that it adopts the off-diagonal elements to exploit the dynamic coupling between the degrees of freedom of the subsystem and the dynamic coupling between the two subsystems. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique in the presence of parameter uncertainties and external disturbances.

AB The rapid development of V2X communication has made it possible to optimize and control the trajectories of vehicles from the whole traffic flow's perspective and improve traffic performance. Therefore, this paper discusses the trajectories management problem on highway facilitated with lanes exclusively for autonomous vehicles (AVs). The paper proposes a model that aims to search for optimal trajectories and minimize total travel time for AVs with multiple initial and target states while averting crashes and conforming to vehicles' kinetic. Dividing the time zone into discrete pieces, the model is analyzed as a large-scale discrete problem influenced by the randomness of the sequence of vehicles. A two-phase algorithm combined with upper evolution strategies and lower dynamic programming is developed to diminish stochastics and reduce computation step by step and solve the trajectories optimization model. Numerical experiments validate that the proposed method is capable of generating optimal trajectories for multiple AVs and approaching to system optimum by simultaneously solving all the spatial and temporal values of the trajectories. The two-phase algorithm can be applied efficiently in practice to obtain a feasible approximate solution for trajectories optimization by presetting appropriate algorithm parameters.

AB The owner-member relationship between wheels and vehicles contributes significantly to the 3D perception of vehicles, especially in embedded environments. However, two major challenges must be addressed to leverage the relationship: i) Standard IoU-based heuristics have difficulty dealing with instances of occluded traffic congestion. ii) It is challenging to demonstrate the solution's efficacy and applicability in a vehicle-mounted system. To address these issues, we propose a novel technique for relationship prediction called DeepWORD which is based on the architecture of a graph convolutional network (GCN). Specifically, we employ feature maps with local correlation as input to the nodes to improve the information richness. Subsequently, we present a graph attention network (GAT) to rectify the priori estimate bias dynamically. Furthermore, we created a large-scale benchmark dataset called WORD that includes annotated owner-member relationships. Sufficient experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of providing state-of-the-art performance and effects in real-time. The WORD dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/NamespaceMain/ownermember- relationship-dataset. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Micro rotorcraft have a great potential for both civilian and military applications, but for successful deployment, they must operate robustly in real-world environments including flight in winds. Due to their small size, common wind fields in and around buildings can represent a large percentage of the vehicle's full flight envelope resulting in highly non-linear motion. An experimental method has been developed to evaluate the capabilities of micro rotorcraft in realistic wind conditions to aid in the design and evaluation of these vehicles. A synthetic wind generation system is used to create repeatable and controllable gust excitations, and a motion capture system is used for precise measurement of vehicle response. Performance metrics associated with the accuracy of position tracking and angular rate excursions are proposed to quantify vehicle capabilities at different excitation levels for design assessment and cross-platform comparison. To demonstrate the experimental method, test results are shown to evaluate the capabilities of a micro coaxial helicopter in realistic winds as a function of gust excitation level and vehicle size. For this example system, light wind gusts degrade hover hold accuracy by a factor of 3 compared to a situation with quiescent winds.

AB In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained increasing popularity. These vehicles are employed in many applications, from military operations to civilian tasks. One of the main fields of UAV research is the vehicle positioning problem. Fully autonomous vehicles are required to be as self-sustained as possible in terms of external sensors. To achieve this in situations where the global positioning system (GPS) does not function, computer vision can be used. This paper presents an implementation of computer vision to hold a quadrotor aircraft in a stable hovering position using a low-cost, consumer-grade, video system. The successful implementation of this system required the development of a data-fusion algorithm that uses both inertial sensors and visual system measurements for the purpose of positioning. The system design is unique in its ability to successfully handle missing and considerably delayed video system data. Finally, a control algorithm was implemented and the whole system was tested experimentally. The results suggest the successful continuation of research in this field. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper presents a constrained connected automated vehicles (CAVs) trajectory optimization method on curved roads with infrastructure assistance. Specifically, this paper systematically formulates trajectory optimization problems in a spatial domain and a curvilinear coordinate. As an alternative of temporal domain and Cartesian coordinate formulation, our formulation provides the constrained trajectory optimization flexibility to describe complex road geometries, traffic regulations, and road obstacles, which are usually spatially varying rather than temporal varying, with assistances vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication. Based on the formulation, we first conducted a mathematical proof on the controllability of our system, to show that our system can be controlled in the spatial domain and curvilinear coordinate. Further, a multiobjective model predictive control (MPC) approach is designed to optimize the trajectories in a rolling horizon fashion and satisfy the collision avoidances, traffic regulations, and vehicle kinematics constraints simultaneously. To verify the control efficiency of our method, multiscenario numerical simulations are conducted. Suggested by the results, our proposed method can provide smooth vehicular trajectories, avoid road obstacles, and simultaneously follow traffic regulations in different scenarios. Moreover, our method is robust to the spatial change of road geometries and other potential disturbances by the road curvature, work zone, and speed limit change.

AB Track curvature is a key parameter in many active control systems for rail vehicles. The real-time autonomous acquisition of track curvature is currently an engineering challenge in the field of rail transit. In this study, the cause of the geometric inertia effect (GIE) when the car body attitude is used to perceive the track curvature was explained by a theoretical derivation using the plane trajectory equation of the rail vehicle. Then, the bogie attitude rather than car body attitude was selected as the sensing signal due to weak GIE. In addition, a new algorithm for measuring the track curvature in real-time using the bogie yaw angular rate and the running velocity was proposed by combining the curvature compensation algorithm (CCA) and percentile filtering (PF) algorithm. Subsequently, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was verified through simulations. The results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm could effectively improve the measurement accuracy of the track curvature. Finally, the algorithm proposed in this study was validated based on running tests. The results of this study can provide a reference for the real-time measurement of track curvature.

AB Articulated vehicles composed of a tractor and several passive trailers are commonly used for transportation purposes in agricultural applications. The increment of the number of trailers increases the payload capacity, but on the other hand, it also implies serious motion constraints, especially in turning scenarios where there is a greater risk of collisions with the crops. In this context, to reduce dangerous maneuvers during the headland turning scenarios, this paper presents a headland turning algorithmization for the N-trailers, characterized by unifying the motion planning stage with the motion control stage, in contrast to most of the available solutions which treat these stages independently. The proposed algorithmization delivers an admissible headland reference path and the location of the vehicle guidance point for the path-following task, to reduce both possible collisions with the crop and the intersegment collisions. The proposed approach was validated by solving several illustrative problems which address various field/crop dimensions and vehicles with different number of trailers. The results showed that the proposed system can find and execute a safe maneuver in a broad range of known situations from the agricultural domain.

AB During the last ten years, automatic guidance systems have become more common in agricultural vehicles. However, users of auto-guided systems can be confused by the growing variety of options commercially available, as well as by the guidance accuracies advertised by different manufacturers. This work proposes an algorithm to evaluate the performance of auto-steered machines for any kind of vehicle and any type of guidances system in the general case of straight row and curved row guidance. The core of the algorithm is based on the comparison of two trajectories: reference course and actual path. The algorithm searches in a neighboring area for the reference points and calculates the deviations. Statistical analysis of the errors provides quantitative information to evaluate the behavior of auto-steered vehicles. The advantage of this technique rests on its independence of regression methods and its immunity to outliers. This methodology was applied to an automatically guided self-propelled forage harvester at both low-speed and high-speed guidance. Results are presented, and when compared to those obtained applying conventional linear regression, they show a slighter impact of outliers and a more efficient procedure and data management.

AB A swarm of unmanned vehicles can provide fine-grained spatial-temporal information acquisition and monitoring in comparison to a single agent, which is beneficial in terms of environment mapping, terrain exploration, and target hunting. However, the cooperation of single type of unmanned vehicles may be not qualified for fulfilling complex underwater tasks considering the motion constraints. In this paper, a joint design of the unmanned aerial/surface/underwater vehicle (UAV-USV-UUV) network, also referred to as 3U network, is proposed for cooperative underwater target hunting. We first introduce the advantages of this 3U heterogeneous system in multi-task cooperation and portray its system model. Moreover, we propose an energy-oriented target hunting model by jointly optimizing the UAV's position, the UUV's trajectory as well as their inter-connectivity. Finally, DQN algorithms are conceived to solve the proposed target hunting problem. Simulation results show the proposed scheme is suitable for underwater target hunting with a high success rate considering a trade-off between the system energy consumption and inter-connectivity.

AB In order to reduce the energy consumption caused by the frequent braking of vehicles at signalized intersections, an optimized speed trajectory control method is proposed, based on braking energy recovery efficiency (BERE) in connection with an automated system for vehicle real-time interaction with roadside facilities and regional central control. Our objectives were as follows; firstly, to establish the simulation model of the hybrid energy regenerative braking system (HERBS) and to verify it by bench test. Secondly, to build up the genetic algorithm (GA) optimization model for the deceleration stopping of the HERBS. Then, to obtain signal light status and timing information to be the constraints; the BERE is to be the optimized objective, resulting in optimization for the speed trajectory under the deceleration stopping condition of a single signalized intersection. Finally, vehicle simulations in ADVISOR software are utilized to validate the optimization results. The results show that the BERE during deceleration stopping at a single signalized intersection after the speed trajectory optimization is 36.21% higher than that of inexperienced drivers, and 7.82% higher than that of experienced drivers.

AB In this paper, pedestrian path prediction at a signalized crosswalk with pedestrian-electric bicycle-vehicle mixed flow is investigated. Firstly, a waiting/crossing decision model (W/CDM) is developed to predict pedestrians' waiting/crossing intentions with approaching vehicles. Secondly, a Modified Social Force Model (MSFM) is developed by taking the evasion with conflicting road users, the reaction to traffic lights and crosswalk boundary into consideration. The influence of pedestrians' heterogeneous characteristics and mixed traf?c flow are considered for the first time. Then the mixed traffic data at a signalized crosswalk is recorded and analysed. A maximum likelihood estimation is proposed to calibrate the parameters. Finally, the integrated method (W/CDM-MSFM) is compared with the existing methods. The results show that the method outperforms the existing methods and accurately predicts the pedestrians' paths, which makes it possible for autonomous vehicles to present the feasibility to protect the safety of pedestrians and improve the efficiency of dynamic traffic.

AB Miniature Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are currently being researched for a wide range of tasks, including search and rescue, surveillance, reconnaissance, traffic monitoring, fire detection, pipe and electrical line inspection, and border patrol to name only a few of the application domains. Although small/miniature UAVs, including both Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) vehicles and small helicopters, have shown great potential in both civilian and military domains, including research and development, integration, prototyping, and field testing, these unmanned systems/vehicles are limited to only a handful of laboratories. This lack of development is due to both the extensive time and cost required to design, integrate and test a fully operational prototype as well as the shortcomings of published materials to fully describe how to design and build a "complete" and "operational" prototype system. This work attempts to overcome existing barriers and limitations by detailing the technical aspects of a small UAV helicopter designed specifically as a testbed vehicle. This design aims to provide a general framework that will not only allow researchers the ability to supplement the system with new technologies but will also allow researchers to add innovation to the vehicle itself.

ID VEHICLE
AB The most typical topological structure of Connected and Autonomous cars (CAVs) is a platoon formation, in which vehicles move closely together, following the leader's instructions, and offer autonomous and intelligent transport services. Nevertheless, several attacks that inject false data into networks and onboard sensors may endanger platoon stability, resulting in severe collisions over road networks in the worst case. This paper proposes a mechanism for cooperative CAV platoon recovery in the face of false data injection attacks called PReCAV. PReCAV employs virtual and physical system models to maintain the resilience of the CAV platoon despite network and sensor attacks. An evaluation by NS3 and SUMO simulations showed that PReCAV provided stability and resilience to the CAV platoon formation in a representative scenario face to false data injection attacks in the network and the sensors. For injecting false data into the network and sensors, we defined an attack model that manipulates information, such as speed and localization, using a uniform distribution to vary the falsification size over time, that is, how far does the information value vary from the correct one. During network and sensors attacks, PReCAV showed average values of 0.16 m/s2 acceleration, 21.76 m/s of speed, and 28.35 m of the distance between vehicles in the platoon when the desired speed was 22 m/s. Meanwhile, for a desired speed of 15 m/s, PReCAV maintained average values of 0.11 m/s2, 15.26 m/s, and 22.42 m in the platoon. Those results demonstrate the ability of PReCAV to maintain vehicle dynamics in the platoon in the face of attacks.

AB Occupants of autonomous vehicle have frequently indicated the desire to sleep or rest while driving, yet little has been known regarding the suitable design criteria for a biomechanically reasoned in-vehicle sleeping position. This study was aimed at evaluating the biomechanical quality of different backrest and seat pan angle combinations, and at predicting the most favourable sleeping positions based on vehicle restriction. More specifically, the interface pressure distribution and subjective suitability rating of 23 subjects was assessed in a total of nine (3 x 3) combinations of seat pan (20 degrees, 30 degrees, 40 degrees) and backrest (145 degrees, 155 degrees, 165 degrees) angles. Biomechanical quality was evaluated with an interface pressure score (IPS) based on sensitivity weighted pressures and the total contact area. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed that IPS significantly improves with increasing seat pan angle whereas backrest angles of 155 degrees or 165 degrees lead to significant better IPS compared to flatter ones (1451. The overall highest IPS was observed for a 40 degrees-seat pan angle in combination with a 155 degrees-backrest angle. Subjective suitability rating revealed that people prefer a combination of 165 degrees backrest angle with a seat pan of 20'; however, eight of nine combinations can be considered as suitable for sleeping. Therefore, the combination of a 40 degrees-seat pan angle and 155 degrees backrest is recommended by the present study for an in-vehicle sleeping position due to the increased biomechanical quality.

AB Automobility refers to the continued, self-perpetuating dominance of privately-owned, gasoline powered vehicles used primarily by single occupants a system which clearly has broad environmental and societal impacts. Despite increasing societal interest in transitions to more sustainable transportation technologies, there has been little consideration of how such innovations might challenge, maintain or support different aspects of automobility, and what that means for technology deployment, transport policy, and user practices. To bring attention to the complexity and apparent durability of the automobility system, in this paper we develop a conceptual framework that explores automobility through a categorization of frames, or shared cultural meanings. This framework moves beyond the typical focus on private, functional considerations of user choice, financial costs and time use to also consider symbolic and societal frames of automobility that exist among users, non-users, industry, policymakers and other relevant social groups. We illustrate this framework with eight particular frames of automobility that fall into four broad categories: private-functional frames such as (1) cocooning and fortressing and (2) mobile digital offices; private-symbolic frames such as (3) gender identity and (4) social status; societal-functional frames such as (5) environmental stewardship and (6) sub urbanization; and societal-symbolic frames such as (7) self-sufficiency and (8) innovativeness. Finally, we start the process of discussing several transportation innovations in light of these automobility frames, namely electrified, autonomous and shared mobility examining early evidence for which frames would be challenged or supported by such transitions. We believe that appreciation of the complex and varied frames of automobility can enrich discussion of transitions and policy relating to sustainable transportation.

AB An effective anomaly detection system is critical for marine autonomous systems operating in complex and dynamic marine environments to reduce operational costs and achieve concurrent large-scale fleet deployments. However, developing an automated fault detection system remains challenging for several reasons including limited data transmission via satellite services. Currently, most anomaly detection for marine autonomous systems, such as underwater gliders, rely on intensive analysis by pilots. This study proposes an unsupervised anomaly detection system using bidirectional generative adversarial networks guided by assistive hints for marine autonomous systems with time series data collected by multiple sensors. In this study, the anomaly detection system for a fleet of underwater gliders is trained on two healthy deployment datasets and tested on other nine deployment datasets collected by a selection of vehicles operating in a range of locations and environmental conditions. The system is successfully applied to detect anomalies in the nine test deployments, which include several different types of anomalies as well as healthy behaviour. Also, a sensitivity study of the data decimation settings suggests the proposed system is robust for Near Real-Time anomaly detection for underwater gliders.

ID UNDERWATER ROBOTS
AB Kinodynamic motion planning enables autonomous robots to find efficient paths while minimizing energy expenditure and avoiding hazards in the environment. However, during plan execution, the controller may deviate from the collision-free path found by the planner due to discrepancies between planning and control, causing inaccurate estimation of path costs and potentially collisions with obstacles. While this can be mitigated by incorporating the vehicle controller into planning, these approaches are generally bottlenecked by the high computation cost of simulating the vehicle dynamics and controller. This letter presents the Parallel Closed-Loop RRT* motion planner that uses a fast neural network controller as a substitute for a computationally-demanding controller during planning. Using a neural network controller and parallelizing the planning process makes closed-loop planning tractable for vehicles with nonlinear dynamics and significantly reduces planning time. Experiments on a simulated underwater vehicle with a model predictive controller demonstrate that our approach yields feasible plans that are more likely to be successfully executed without collisions compared to planners that do not consider the controller.

AB Automated Driving Systems (ADS) have received a considerable amount of attention in the last few decades, as part of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) field. However, this technology still lacks total automation capacities while keeping driving comfort and safety under risky scenarios, for example, overtaking, obstacle avoidance, or lane changing. Consequently, this work presents a novel method to resolve the obstacle avoidance and overtaking problems named Hybrid Planning. This solution combines the passenger's comfort associated with the smoothness of Bezier curves and the reliable capacities of Model Predictive Control (MPC) to react against unexpected conditions, such as obstacles on the lane, overtaking and lane-change based maneuvers. A decoupled linear-model was used for the MPC formulation to ensure short computation times. The obstacles and other vehicles' information are obtained via V2X (vehicle communications). The tests were performed in an automated Renault Twizy vehicle and they have shown good performance under complex scenarios involving static and moving obstacles at a maximum speed of 60 kph.

AB With the popularisation of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, relay communication based on multi-UAVs has advantages and application prospects. However, determining the location of UAV relay nodes is a fundamental problem. In particular, when multiple UAVs are required, it is important to design an efficient node placement method that optimises the layout of UAV nodes to minimise the number of required UAVs and provide reliable connectivity for all ground terminals. In this study, the node placement models for multi-UAV relay communication are constructed based on the non-linear constraint optimisation problem for typical application scenarios, and the solving algorithm of the models is proposed based on the smallest enclosing circle and genetic algorithm. Through the new placement method, the authors can locate UAV relay nodes and optimise the network topology with the minimum number of UAVs required. Finally, the implementation process and results are validated by simulation.

AB This paper presents a method of realizing driver-compatible steering systems in ITS, for vehicles that have capabilities of carrying out path following tasks. The method aims to maintain steering smoothness from high to low vehicle speed, including nonhighway environments, which may involve tighter turns. Multiple look-ahead points are introduced, which allows to guide the vehicle with minimum steering corrections, while maintaining the tracking accuracy. The look-ahead points, one for recognizing the path deviation for the error-cancel feedback control and the other for predicting the necessary steering for feedforward control, are varied independently according to vehicle speed. This appropriately distributes the controls and determines the final output of the steering system. The look-ahead distance for feedforward is extended longer than the look-ahead distance for feedback at low velocities, and is shortened according to velocity increase. The look-ahead distance for the feedback acts the opposite. The steering control system was implemented onto an experimental vehicle and tests were conducted. The results of path following experiments show that the method is capable of realizing smooth steering control when tracking paths involving various turns, in a wide speed range, while maintaining tracking accuracy.

AB Predicting accurate depth with monocular images is important for low-cost robotic applications and autonomous driving. This study proposes a comprehensive self-supervised framework for accurate scale-aware depth prediction on autonomous driving scenes utilizing inter-frame poses obtained from inertial measurements. In particular, we introduce a Full-Scale depth prediction network named FSNet. FSNet contains four important improvements over existing self-supervised models: (1) a multichannel output representation for stable training of depth prediction in driving scenarios, (2) an optical-flow-based mask designed for dynamic object removal, (3) a self-distillation training strategy to augment the training process, and (4) an optimization-based post-processing algorithm in test time, fusing the results from visual odometry. With this framework, robots and vehicles with only one well-calibrated camera can collect sequences of training image frames and camera poses, and infer accurate 3D depths of the environment without extra labeling work or 3D data. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset, KITTI-360 dataset and the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the potential of FSNet.

AB This letter presents GAMMA, a general motion prediction model that enables large-scale real-time simulation and planning for autonomous driving. GAMMA models heterogeneous, interactive traffic agents that operate under diverse road conditions, with various geometric and kinematic constraints. GAMMA treats the prediction task as constrained optimization in traffic agents' velocity space. The objective is to optimize an agent's driving performance, while obeying all the constraints resulting from the agent's kinematics, collision avoidance with other agents, and the environmental context. Further, GAMMA explicitly conditions the prediction on human behavioral states as parameters of the optimization model, in order to account for versatile human behaviors. We evaluated GAMMA on a set of real-world benchmark datasets. The results show that GAMMA achieves high prediction accuracy on both homogeneous and heterogeneous traffic datasets, with sub-millisecond execution time. Further, the computational efficiency and the flexibility of GAMMA enable (i) simulation of mixed urban traffic at many locations worldwide and (ii) planning for autonomous driving in dense traffic with uncertain driver behaviors, both in real-time. The open-source code of GAMMA is available online.

AB This review paper focuses on different aspects of perceived safety for a number of autonomous physical systems. This is a major aspect of robotics research, as more and more applications allow humans and autonomous systems to share their space, with crucial implications both on safety and on its perception. The alternative terms used to express related concepts (e.g., psychological safety, trust, comfort, stress, fear, and anxiety) are listed and explained. Then, the available methods to assess perceived safety (i.e., questionnaires, physiological measurements, behavioral assessment, and direct input devices) are described. Six categories of autonomous systems are considered (industrial polyarticulated manipulators, indoor mobile robots, mobile manipulators, humanoid robots, drones, and autonomous vehicles), providing an overview of the main themes related to perceived safety in the specific domain, a description of selected works, and an analysis of how motion and characteristics of the system influence the perception of safety. The survey also discusses experimental duration and location of the reviewed papers, and the connection between perceived safety and safety standards. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Autonomous systems, including airborne, land-based, marine, and underwater vehicles, are increasingly present in the world. One important aspect of autonomy is the capability to process information and to make independent decisions for achieving a mission goal. Information on the level of risk related to the operation may improve the decision-making process of autonomous systems. This article describes the integration of risk analysis methods with the control system of autonomous and highly automated systems that are evaluated during operation. Four main areas of implementation are identified; (i) risk models used to directly make decisions, (ii) use of the output of risk models as input to decision-making and optimization algorithms, (iii) the output of risk models may be used as a constraint in or modifying constraints of algorithms, and (iv) the output of risk models may be used to inform representations or maps of the environment to be used in path planning. A case study on a dynamic positioning controller of an offshore supply vessel exemplifies the concepts described in this article. In addition, it demonstrates how risk model output may be used within a hybrid controller.

ID SYSTEMS
AB Advances in autonomy offer the potential for dramatic positive outcomes in a number of domains, yet enabling their safe deployment remains an open problem. This work's motivating question is: In safety-critical settings, can we avoid the need to have one human supervise one machine at all times? The work formalizes this scalable supervision problem by considering remotely located human supervisors and investigating how autonomous agents can cooperate to achieve safety. This article focuses on the safety-critical context of autonomous vehicles (AVs) merging into traffic consisting of a mixture of AVs and human drivers. The analysis establishes high reliability upper bounds on human supervision requirements. It further shows that AV cooperation can improve supervision reliability by orders of magnitude and counterintuitively requires fewer supervisors (per AV) as more AVs are adopted. These analytical results leverage queuing-theoretic analysis, order statistics, and a conservative, reachability-based approach. A key takeaway is the potential value of cooperation in enabling the deployment of autonomy at scale. While this work focuses on AVs, the scalable supervision framework may be of independent interest to a broader array of autonomous control challenges.

ID PREDICTIVE CONTROL; AVOIDANCE
AB Motion planning for autonomous racing is a challenging task due to the safety requirement while driving aggressively. Most previous solutions utilize the prior information or depend on complex dynamics modeling. Classical model-free reinforcement learning methods are based on random sampling, which severely increases the training consumption and undermines the exploration efficiency. In this letter, we propose an efficient residual policy learning method for high-speed autonomous racing named ResRace, which leverages only the real-time raw observation of LiDAR and IMU for low-latency obstacle avoiding and navigation. We first design a controller based on the modified artificial potential field (MAPF) to generate a policy for navigation. Besides, we utilize the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to generate a residual policy as a supplement to obtain the optimal policy. Concurrently, the MAPF policy effectively guides the exploration and increases the update efficiency. This complementary property contributes to the fast convergence and few required resources of our method. We also provide extensive experiments to illustrate our method outperforms the leading algorithms and reaches the comparable level of professional human players on the five F1Tenth tracks.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Smart mobility is transforming the way the current transportation network is envisioned. It holds the promise of a more sustainable, safer, and efficient future for commuters. Nevertheless, traffic management centers are constantly facing the challenges of ensuring that transportation system components are operating as expected and in a safe manner. As a result, research efforts on improving traffic monitoring aim to design and implement novel approaches for safety applications. In this paper, we adopt formal methods to specify and apply reason to the traffic network's complex properties. Formal methods provide a framework to rigorously define the safe operation of the traffic network by capturing non-conforming travel behavior, exploring various possible states of vehicular traffic, and detecting any irregularities that may arise. In this work, a new approach to traffic monitoring is proposed, which uses specification-based monitoring. We develop monitors that define traffic parameters, such as conforming to speed limits and maintaining appropriate headway. A formal language known as Signal Temporal Logic is used to specify and analyze these traffic rules. The proposed framework is then applied to a calibrated micro-simulated highway network to identify whether individual vehicle trajectories violate or satisfy the proposed specifications. Statistical analysis of the outputs shows that our proposed approach is effective in differentiating between violating and conforming vehicles. This approach can be used by traffic management centers that are seeking to accommodate emerging mobility technologies that are autonomous and connected. In particular, the presented work can be valuable in studying traffic stream properties, identifying possible hazards, and providing valuable feedback for automating traffic monitoring systems.

AB This paper presents a robust predictive control scheme with a graphic-based delay boundary analysis to mitigate the electric vehicle (EV) drivetrain oscillating issues, subject to the multi-channel compounding-construction loop delays. The application of Controller Area Network (CAN) in autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) inevitably induces multi-channel compounding-construction loop delays into the control loop. The in-deep analyzing and understanding of the network-induced loop delays is critical for the electrified powertrain and its motion control. This study aims to guarantee, explicitly, the motion stability of AEV drivetrains as safe-critical and hard real-time applications. Firstly, a graphic-based constructional representation approach is presented for modeling of the compounding-construction loop delays. To resolve the upper bound of the compounding-construction loop delays further, a mathematic expression of delay boundary-envelopment analysis is derived. Secondly, based on the reasonable upper bound, Taylor series expansion is applied to make the system model with nonlinear uncertainties caused by the network-induced loop delays represent in the form of the convex polytope. Then, with the convex polytope of the drivetrain system model, a robust model predictive control (RMPC) approach is developed to enhance the system robustness against the unexpected network-induced delays. To attenuate the online calculation burden, a scheme combining off-line design and on-line synthesis is provided. Finally, the satisfactory motion control performance in both the co-simulations (Matlab&Carsim) and bench experimental tests can strongly verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

AB This paper describes a path planning method for a small autonomous aerial vehicle to be used for inspecting overhead electricity power lines. A computational algorithm is described which converts a standard three dimensional array representation of one or more obstacles in the vehicle's environment into an octree and a connectivity graph. This achieves a significant reduction in computer memory usage and an increase in execution speed when the graph is searched. Path planning is based on a three-dimensional extension of the distance transform. Test results demonstrate rapid and effective operation of the planner within different workspaces.

In particular, we generate sparse and interpretable models that relate the states of aquatic drones involved in autonomous water monitoring to the properties (e.g., statistical distribution) of data collected by drone sensors. The subspace clustering algorithm used is called SubCMedians. A quantitative experimental analysis is performed to investigate the connections between i) learning parameters and performance, ii) noise in the data and performance. The clustering obtained with this analysis outperforms those generated by previous approaches.

ID MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS
AB This paper investigates the problem of cooperative path-following control for underactuated autonomous surface vessels in the presence of the model uncertainties, environmental disturbance, actuator failures and limited communication. A novel intelligent controller is designed for autonomous surface vessels to track priori parameterized reference paths so that the desired formation can be achieved. In the algorithm, the model uncertainties are estimated by neural networks. By virtue of the dynamic surface control technique, the inherent problem "explosion of complexity" occurred in the traditional Backstepping design framework is avoided. A concise adaptive law is developed to compensate the upper bound of the weight matrix for neural networks, rather than the whole weight matrix. Furthermore, the event-triggered mechanism is embedded into the cooperative controller to reduce the frequency of inter-vehicle communication. The cooperative controller is updated only at the instant when the threshold condition is violated. By using the Lyapunov theory, both the semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded and fault-tolerance capability of the closed-loop system are guaranteed. Finally, numerical examples are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm.

AB The environmental benefits and burdens of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are still a subject of debate in the existing literature. This research aims to address this gap by conducting a life cycle assessment of CAVs, focusing on different transition phases in terms of the associated traffic operations and environmental impacts. A micro-simulation was carried out on a specific roadway section, considering varying CAVs market penetration rates (MPR) and traffic volumes, assuming all vehicles were powered by internal combustion engines. The findings revealed that the most optimal traffic and environmental performance occurred when the MPR ranged between 70 and 80%. Notably, the use phase contributed to 90% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy consumption. In comparison to the baseline conditions, the production phase experienced a 5% increase in CAV emissions, while the end-of-life phase saw a 1.5% increase. Conversely, emissions during the use phase decreased by 5%. Sensitivity analysis indicated statistically significant outcomes at higher traffic congestion levels, indicating that CAVs improved traffic operations and mitigated environmental impacts during periods of heavy traffic.

AB With the rapid development of electric vehicles and artificial intelligence technology, the automatic driving industry has entered a rapid development stage. However, there is a risk of traffic accidents due to the blind spot of vision, whether autonomous vehicles or traditional vehicles. In this article, a multi-sensor fusion perception method is proposed, in which the semantic information from the camera and the range information from the LiDAR are fused at the data layer and the LiDAR point cloud containing semantic information is clustered to obtain the type and location information of the objects. Based on the sensor equipments deployed on the roadside, the sensing information processed by the fusion method is sent to the nearby vehicles in real-time through 5G and V2X technology for blind spot early warning, and its feasibility is verified by experiments and simulations. The blind spot warning scheme based on roadside multi-sensor fusion perception proposed in this article has been experimentally verified in the closed park, which can obviously reduce the traffic accidents caused by the blind spot of vision, and is of great significance to improve traffic safety.

AB Artificial potential fields (APF) and reinforcement learning (RL) are two common methods for the intelligent decision of autonomous vehicles. The process of vehicle driving includes the constraints of vehicle dynamics, traffic rules, road conditions, and other traffic vehicles, which are quite complex. The existing APF methods perform inadequately since they consider only limited factors and their effects. As such, it is difficult to adapt to increasingly complex traffic environments. In this paper, we propose a new concept, compound traffic field (CTF). The concept makes use of field theory to model various traffic environments based on the physical properties and traffic rules, besides, introduces the concept of the force correction field to reveal the interaction between the vehicle and the surrounding environment during driving. Moreover, an intelligent decision method and a co-simulation platform are established based on combining RL and CTF. The method has passed the tests in various scenarios built by PreScan and compared with the Conventional APF and modeless algorithm. For solving intelligent decision problems in the complex environment provides an applicable field model and its application method.

AB The details of an onboard visual-based navigation system that allows an unmanned aerial vehicle to perform power line following are presented in this article. A histogram of oriented segments method was developed to establish the main angle orientation of power lines. The histogram of oriented segment is also used to discard segments that are not power lines in the images. The components of the unmanned aerial vehicle flight system which include the platform configuration and the hardware used are also presented. A set of tests were designed to validate the methods and the overall system. The system was tested with a sequence of images taken from different perspectives in real inspection tasks. Tests were performed with images taken using an unmanned aerial vehicle with a camera, pointing vertically downward, and also using different kinds of cameras. The techniques developed for unmanned aerial vehicle navigation were employed over power lines using a multirotor. The results showed that a vision system based on the developed techniques is able to give important information to an unmanned aerial vehicle in order to perform autonomous flight missions.

AB Active safety systems which assess highly dynamic traffic situations including pedestrians are required with growing demands in autonomous driving and Connected Vehicles. In this paper, we focus on one of the most hazardous traffic situations: the possible collision between a pedestrian and a turning vehicle at signalized intersections. This paper presents a probabilistic model of pedestrian behavior to signalized crosswalks. In order to model the behavior of pedestrian, we take not only pedestrian physical states but also contextual information into account. We propose a model based on the Dynamic Bayesian Network which integrates relationships among the intersection context information and the pedestrian behavior in the same way as a human. The particle filter is used to estimate the pedestrian states, including position, crossing decision and motion type. Experimental evaluation using real traffic data shows that this model is able to recognize the pedestrian crossing decision in a few seconds from the traffic signal and pedestrian position information. This information is assumed to be obtained with the development of Connected Vehicle. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The intelligent autonomous control of hypersonic vehicles has aroused great interest from the field of spacecraft. To solve the problem of longitudinal attitude control of hypersonic vehicle in gliding phase, a new intelligent controller is proposed in this paper. This new controller is based on the fuzzy dynamic characteristic modeling method. The fuzzy logic is introduced into the characteristic modeling by dividing the whole restriction range into several subspaces. Simulations show that this modification greatly improves the performance of the original method. With the same whole restriction range the fuzzy dynamic characteristic modeling decreases the time of convergence, and at the same time makes the attitude angle tracing more precise and robust. Since the sub-model is a characteristic model that has stronger adaptiveness than a fixed local model, the number of fuzzy rules is greatly reduced. Our model sharply reduces the complexity in constructing a fuzzy dynamic model. Finally, simulation results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in dealing with the attitude control problem of hypersonic vehicle in gliding phase.

AB Throughout the field of transportation and vehicle systems control is gaining importance. This paper focuses on the current key problems engineers in this field are facing and highlights some major recent accomplishments. The driving forces behind the increasing use of control are the rising need for transportation services and the demand for a higher safety level. While each domain takes specific approach to deal with these demands, a general trend towards automatic co-pilots or even autopilots is visible. In the automotive domain, this is aided by the design of drive by wire systems. In other fields like marine or aerospace systems, the focus of research is on the swarming behavior of multiple vessels. New sensors and networking will also enable more efficient traffic flow control which will allow for a better use of the resource network capacity. Another trend in the vehicle systems sector is the modeling of nonlinear system behavior which is starting to replace look-up tables in real time systems. A forecast on future trends is given at the end of the paper. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent years have seen an unprecedented spread of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ( UAVs, or "drones"), which are highly useful for both civilian and military applications. Flight safety is a crucial issue in UAV navigation, having to ensure accurate compliance with recently legislated rules and regulations. The emerging use of autonomous drones and UAV swarms raises additional issues, making it necessary to transfuse safety- and regulations-awareness to relevant algorithms and architectures. Computer vision plays a pivotal role in such autonomous functionalities. Although themain aspects of autonomous UAV technologies (e.g., path planning, navigation control, landing control, mapping and localization, target detection/tracking) are already mature and well-covered, ensuring safe flying in the vicinity of crowds, avoidance of passing over persons, or guaranteed emergency landing capabilities in case of malfunctions, are generally treated as an afterthought when designing autonomous UAV platforms for unstructured environments. This fact is reflected in the fragmentary coverage of the above issues in current literature. This overview attempts to remedy this situation, from the point of view of computer vision. It examines the field from multiple aspects, including regulations across the world and relevant current technologies. Finally, since very few attempts have been made so far towards a complete UAV safety flight and landing pipeline, an example computer vision-based UAV flight safety pipeline is introduced, taking into account all issues present in current autonomous drones. The content is relevant to any kind of autonomous drone flight (e.g., for movie/TV production, news-gathering, search and rescue, surveillance, inspection, mapping, wildlife monitoring, crowd monitoring/management), making this a topic of broad interest.

AB Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) has one of the most promising drivetrain technology. However, the BEVs are facing the limited cruising range which generally reduces their share in the automotive market. Velocity profile, acceleration characteristics, road gradients, and drive techniques around curves have significant impacts on the energy consumption of the BEVs. A semi-autonomous ecological driver assistance system to regulate the velocity with energy-efficient techniques is proposed to address the limitation. The main contribution of this paper is the design of a real-time nonlinear model predictive controller with improved inequality constraints handling and economic penalty function to plan the online cost-effective cruising velocity. This system is based on the extended cruise control driver assistance system which controls the longitudinal velocity of the BEV in a safe and energy efficient manner by taking advantage of road slopes, effective drive around curves, and respecting the traffic regulation. A real-time optimisation algorithm is adapted and extended with economic objective function. Instead of the conventional Euclidean norms, deadzone penalty functions are proposed to achieve the economic objectives. In addition, the states inequality constraints are handled based on the proposed soft nonlinear complementarity function aimed to preserve the relaxed complementary slackness to enhance the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) method. Obtained numerical simulation and field experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for a semi-autonomous electric vehicle in terms of real-time energy-efficient velocity regulation and constraints satisfaction intended to improve the cruising range capability of the BEVs.

AB The paper presents an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS), consisting of several aerial vehicles and a central station, for forest fire monitoring. Fire monitoring is defined as the computation in real-time of the evolution of the fire front shape and potentially other parameters related to the fire propagation, and is very important for forest fire fighting. The paper shows how an UAS can automatically obtain this information by means of on-board infrared or visual cameras. Moreover, it is shown how multiple aerial vehicles can collaborate in this application, allowing to cover bigger areas or to obtain complementary views of a fire. The paper presents results obtained in experiments considering actual controlled forest fires in quasi-operational conditions, involving a fleet of three vehicles, two autonomous helicopters and one blimp.

ID GUIDED-VEHICLE SYSTEM; ENVIRONMENT
AB When simple automated guided vehicles (AGVs) having no random access load transfer mechanism are used for carrying multiple loads between workstations, the loads cannot be handled independently. This paper considers the case when loads are placed in flat pallets and each new picked up pallet is loaded on the top of batch of pallets already carried by the AGV. To avoid use of excessive space and time needed to reorder pallets in the batch, the loading-unloading procedures should be performed in accordance with last-in-first-out (LIFO) rule. In this paper we formulate the condition of existence of AGV routes in which, it visits each workstation only once and meets LIFO constraint. We also suggest an algorithm for finding the shortest one among such routes. Examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the algorithm.

The KAUV-1 has a unique ducted propeller located at the aft end with yawing actuation acting as a rudder. For depth motion, the KAUV-1 is designed to have a mass shifter mechanism inside to change the vehicle center of gravity and to control its pitch angle and depth motion. The paper also presents an analysis on the equations of motion of the KAUV-1 with mass shifter mechanism and a new depth control strategy for the KAUV-1. The feasibility of the proposed control strategy is validated through simulation and experiment of performance of the vehicle.

AB This paper proposes a method for controlling formations of autonomous nonholonomic vehicles in order to reach a desired target region. The approach is based on utilization of pairs of virtual leaders whose control inputs are obtained in a single optimization process using model predictive control (MPC) methodology. The obtained solution of the optimization includes both a complete plan for the formation including the overall structure of robots' workspace and control inputs for each vehicle. This ensures collision-free trajectories between the robots as well as dynamic obstacles. The proposed method enables to autonomously design arbitrary manoeuvres, like reverse driving or rotations of compact formations of car-like robots. Such a complicated behavior is illustrated by simulations and by experiments. Furthermore, the requirements that guarantee convergence of the group to the target region are formulated.

AB The paper describes an algorithm for sensor-based map building and navigation for an autonomous mobile vehicle. The algorithm is based on the use of an extended Kalman filter to obtain estimates of the location and identity of geometric features in an unknown environment. A multitarget tracking methodology is applied to the evaluation of multiple hypotheses about the locations of geometric features in the environment. The algorithm does not require any a priori information about the environment. It is capable of initiating new geometric features and identifying the type of a geometric feature from the given set of geometric features, utilising the data provided by a set of sonar sensors. The algorothm is also capable of deleting geometric features from the map of the environment when they are no longer detected by the sensors. The implementation of the algorithm is discussed, and results using real sonar data are presented.

ID CONGESTION; MICROSIMULATION
AB Modern urban mobility needs new solutions to resolve high-complexity demands on urban traffic-control systems, including reducing congestion, fuel and energy consumption, and exhaust gas emissions. One example is urban motorways as key segments of the urban traffic network that do not achieve a satisfactory level of service to serve the increasing traffic demand. Another complex need arises by introducing the connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and accompanying additional challenges that modern control systems must cope with. This study addresses the problem of decreasing the negative environmental aspects of traffic, which includes reducing congestion, fuel and energy consumption, and exhaust gas emissions. We applied a variable speed limit (VSL) based on Q-Learning that utilizes electric CAVs as speed-limit actuators in the control loop. The Q-Learning algorithm was combined with the two-step temporal difference target to increase the algorithm's effectiveness for learning the VSL control policy for mixed traffic flows. We analyzed two different optimization criteria: total time spent on all vehicles in the traffic network and total energy consumption. Various mixed traffic flow scenarios were addressed with varying CAV penetration rates, and the obtained results were compared with a baseline no-control scenario and a rule-based VSL. The data about vehicle-emission class and the share of gasoline and diesel human-driven vehicles were taken from the actual data from the Croatian Bureau of Statistics. The obtained results show that Q-Learning-based VSL can learn the control policy and improve the macroscopic traffic parameters and total energy consumption and can reduce exhaust gas emissions for different electric CAV penetration rates. The results are most apparent in cases with low CAV penetration rates. Additionally, the results indicate that for the analyzed traffic demand, the increase in the CAV penetration rate alleviates the need to impose VSL control on an urban motorway.

AB Limitations of access have long restricted exploration and investigation of the cavities beneath ice shelves to a small number of drillholes. Studies of sea-ice underwater morphology are limited largely to scientific utilization of submarines. Remotely operated vehicles, tethered to a mother ship by umbilical cable, have been deployed to investigate tidewater-glacier and ice-shelf margins, but their range is often restricted. The development of free-flying autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with ranges of tens to hundreds of kilometres enables extensive missions to take place beneath sea ice and floating ice shelves. Autosub2 is a 3600 kg, 6.7 m long AUV, with a 1600 m operating depth and range of 400 km, based on the earlier Autosub1 which had a 500 rn depth limit. A single direct-drive d.c. motor and five-bladed propeller produce speeds of 1-2 m s(-1). Rear-mounted rudder and stern-plane control yaw, pitch and depth. The vehicle has three sections. The front and rear sections are free-flooding, built around aluminium extrusion space-frames covered with glass-fibre reinforced plastic panels. The central section has a set of carbon-fibre reinforced plastic pressure vessels. Four tubes contain batteries powering the vehicle. The other three house vehicle-control systems and sensors. The rear section houses subsystems for navigation, control actuation and propulsion and scientific sensors (e.g. digital camera, upward-looking 300 kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler, 200 kHz multibeam receiver). The front section contains forward-looking collision sensor, emergency abort, the homing systems, Argos satellite data and location transmitters and flashing lights for relocation as well as science sensors (e.g. twin conductivity-temperature-depth instruments, multibeam transmitter, sub-bottom profiler, AquaLab water sampler). Payload restrictions mean that a subset of scientific instruments is actually in place on any given dive. The scientific instruments carried on Autosub are described and examples of observational data collected from each sensor in Arctic or Antarctic waters are given (e.g. of roughness at the underside of floating ice shelves and sea ice).

AB Connected and automated vehicles will characterize the future of the mobility, featured by Smart Roads and Internet of Things technologies. Vehicles will behave as mobile nodes of a network enabling communication between them and with respect to the road infrastructure. In order to provide advanced driver assistance and automated driving along a Smart Road, control strategies need to take into account both parametric variations due to environmental and/or weather conditions (e.g., wind speed, presence of ice, and/or rain), and constraints related to road safety and vehicular traffic. For this reason, advanced adaptive control strategies result particularly suitable to provide a complete control of the vehicle. This article proposes an extension to a previous conference paper, concerning a Processor in the Loop testing of an Adaptive Model Predictive Control for coupled longitudinal/lateral vehicle dynamics, where the ego vehicle was simulated through a bicycle model. In the present work, a low-cost real-time Hardware In the Loop test bench, featured by Raspberry boards, is used to verify the control strategy in a way closer to a real application. A four-wheel vehicle dynamic model is considered to simulate the ego vehicle, then robustness and sensitivity tests with respect to parametric variations related to road friction, wind speed and vehicle mass, and a comparison with an existing adaptive MPC are performed. The achieved results show good robustness properties, safety performances and confirm the real-time execution of the control strategy, paving the way for future developments, where the goal will be the testing in a real road scenario by using an IoT gateway purposefully designed by the NetCom company.

AB Mathematical models of vehicle dynamics will form essential components of future autonomous vehicles. They may be used within inverse or forward control loops, or within predictive learning systems. Often, nonlinear physical models are used in this context, which, though conceptually simple (especially for decoupled, longitudinal dynamics), may be computationally costly to parameterise and also inaccurate if they omit vehicle-specific dynamics. In this study we sought to determine the relative merits of a commonly used nonlinear physical model of vehicle dynamics versus data-driven models in large-scale real-world driving conditions. To this end, we compared the performance of a standard nonlinear physical model with a linear state-space model and a neural network model. The large-scale experimental data was obtained from two vehicles; a Lancia Delta car and a Jeep Renegade sport utility vehicle. The vehicles were driven on regular, public roads, during normal human driving, across a range of road gradients. Both data-driven models outperformed the physical model. The neural network model performed best for both vehicles; the state-space model performed almost as well as the neural network for the Lancia Delta, but fell short for the Jeep Renegade whose dynamics were more strongly nonlinear. Our results suggest that the linear data-driven model gives a good trade-off in accuracy and simplicity, whilst the neural network model is most accurate and is extensible to more nonlinear operating conditions, and finally that the widely used physical model may not be the best choice for control design.

AB The 3D vehicle trajectory in complex traffic conditions such as crossroads and heavy traffic is practically very useful in autonomous driving. In order to accurately extract the 3D vehicle trajectory from a perspective camera in a crossroad where the vehicle has an angular range of 360 degrees, problems such as the narrow visual angle in single-camera scene, vehicle occlusion under conditions of low camera perspective, and lack of vehicle physical information must be solved. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating the 3D bounding boxes of vehicles and extracting trajectories using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) in an overlapping multi-camera crossroad scene. First, traffic data were collected using overlapping multi-cameras to obtain a wide range of trajectories around the crossroad. Then, 3D bounding boxes of vehicles were estimated and tracked in each single-camera scene through DCNN models (YOLOv4, multi-branch CNN) combined with camera calibration. Using the abovementioned information, the 3D vehicle trajectory could be extracted on the ground plane of the crossroad by calculating results obtained from the overlapping multi-camera with a homography matrix. Finally, in experiments, the errors of extracted trajectories were corrected through a simple linear interpolation and regression, and the accuracy of the proposed method was verified by calculating the difference with ground-truth data. Compared with other previously reported methods, our approach is shown to be more accurate and more practical.

AB With the coming of intelligent vehicles and vehicular communication, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) of connected vehicles are emerging and now evolving to Cooperative-ITS (C-ITS), as service platforms for smart cities. Considering new service properties, the autonomous cooperation of such vehicles has exhibited novel QoS features that imply new requirements: guaranteeing the traffic efficiency of any emergent vehicle while trying to promote the throughput at an intersection. So, after analyzing the classic reservation-based cooperation mechanisms, new QoS-oriented cooperation methods and policies are studied in this work. Concretely, several models of related traffic objects we have proposed are firstly introduced briefly. Then, the scheduling policies of vehicles approaching an intersection have been presented, including three existing policies (FAFP-SV, FAFP-SQ, and HQEP-SV) and five new polices (FAFP-SQ-SV, FAFP-MQ, HWFP-SQ, HWFP-SQ-SV, HWFP-MQ). These policies combine two major factors: vehicular priority for scheduling and concurrency in traffics. The first one includes the vehicular arrival-time, priority mapped to QoS, and the weight of reserved vehicles on a lane etc. In addition, the second refers to schedule a platoon rather than single vehicle each time, or platoons on different lanes instead of one platoon on only one lane. All these policies have been implemented, and further, verified within the parameter-configurable traffic simulator QoS-CITS (v2.1) we designed and developed with C#. Abundant experiments have been conducted with configured typical traffic scenes, and experimental results show that HWFP-SQ-SV and HWFP-MQ can guarantee both the QoS of emergent vehicles and traffic throughput better than other six policies.

AB Integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into vehicular networks have shown high potentials in affording intensive computing tasks. In this paper, we study the digital twin driven vehicular edge computing networks for adaptively computing resource management where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) named FlexEdge acts as a flying server. In particular, we first formulate an energy consumption minimization problem by jointly optimizing UAV trajectory and computation resource under the practical constraints. To address such a challenging problem, we then build the computation offloading process as a Markov decision process and propose a deep reinforcement learning-based proximal policy optimization algorithm to dynamically learn the computation offloading strategy and trajectory design policy. Numerical results indicate that our proposed algorithm can achieve quick convergence rate and significantly reduce the system energy consumption.

AB This paper discusses the development and testing of an upset recovery architecture that is applicable for both piloted and autonomous recoveries. The architecture was first developed for unmanned vehicles and intended for fully automated implementation. The architecture was extended for use in manned aircraft and, in particular, for situations in which recoveries are being manually flown by a pilot. This extension required development of display technology for presenting recommended recovery guidance to the pilot as well as modification of recovery strategies to make them suitable for execution by a human pilot. Most recently, the architecture has been extended to accommodate off-nominal vehicle dynamics (e.g., due to actuator failures) and has been structured specifically to facilitate implementation without modification and recertification of existing flight control software. The approaches have been tested in multiple pilot-in-the-loop simulation experiments, which have shown both favorable pilot opinions and improved recovery performance.

AB In this study, an asymptotic tracking controller is developed for an aircraft model subject to additive, state-dependent, non-linear disturbance-like terms. Dynamic inversion technique in conjunction with robust integral of the sign of the error term is utilised in the controller design. Compared to the previous studies, the need of acceleration measurements of the aircraft have been removed. In addition, the proposed controller design utilises only the output of aircraft dynamics. Lyapunov based analysis is applied to prove global asymptotic convergence of the tracking error signal. Numerical simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed robust controller.

AB This paper presents an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platform used for the competition held at the International Conference for Unmanned Aircraft Systems 2022 (ICUAS'22). The envisioned scenario in the competition is delivering an extinguishing ball to a fire with a UAV. Driven on that thought, the qualifying round of the competition is organized in a realistic simulation environment. The competitors are required to navigate through a cluttered environment into a free space, where they perform a search for the target and deliver the ball as close as possible to that target. The competition finals were organized as a part of the conference, with the same goal as in the simulation qualifiers. The UAVs used for the competition are prepared and provided by the organizers. A detailed description of the UAV software and hardware is outlined in the paper as a step towards standardizing aerial research platform.

AB Recent advances in inter-vehicle wireless communications allow for automated and coordinated vehicles' driving in platoon-based vehicular cyber-physical systems (PVCPS). This article presents a comprehensive low-latency cooperative security (LLCS) framework for secure and timely data dissemination in PVCPS. A new cooperative secret key agreement protocol is incorporated to produce secret keys for platooning vehicles based on their radio channel correlation. A new transmit rate adaptation mechanism is presented to minimize the end-to-end latency of the data dissemination in PVCPS. We also numerically test the confidentiality and timeliness of the LLCS framework in terms of key agreement probability and dissemination delay. It is believed that the LLCS framework is the demand of the time to enable secure and reliable autonomous driving for future PVCPS.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are increasingly recognised as a utility for inspection applications in construction. In order to create measurable benefit over traditional inspection methods, an inspection concept for UAVs must be integrated and automated. This work is the result of an ongoing effort to create a workflow for the structured planning, simulation and execution of inspection tasks. An application was developed that allows the operator to plan inspections in a 3D environment. The application automatically generates collision-free flight paths based on Building Information Modelling (BIM) data. A realistic simulation environment provides a good understanding of the flight dynamics caused by inhibiting factors, such as disturbances of the positioning system. A case study confirms the hypothesis of the inspection concept and hints at technical limitations of autonomous UAVs that need to be overcome in subsequent development efforts.

AB This paper deals with object recognition in outdoor environments. In this type of environments, lighting conditions cannot be controlled and predicted, objects can be partially occluded, and their position and orientation is not known a priori. The chosen type of objects is traffic or road signs, due to their usefulness for sign maintenance, inventory in highways and cities, Driver Support Systems and Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles. A genetic algorithm is used for the detection step, allowing an invariance localisation to changes in position, scale, rotation, weather conditions, partial occlusion, and the presence of other objects of the same colour. A neural network achieves the classification. The global system not only recognises the traffic sign but also provides information about its condition or state. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB In this paper, we propose a robust detection and tracking strategy for autonomous aerial refueling of unmanned aerial vehicles. The proposed framework includes two modules: a faster deep-learning-based detector (DLD) and a more accurate reinforcement-learning-based tracker (RLT). In the detection stage, the DLD achieves faster speed by combining the efficient MoblieNet with the you only look once framework. In the tracking stage, RLT is proposed to obtain target's position accurately and fastly by performing hierarchically positioning and adjusting target bounding box according to the reinforcement learning. The precision of drogue object tracking is 98.7, which is obviously higher than the other comparison methods. The speed of our network can achieve 15 frames/s on GPU Titan X. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.

AB An altitude navigation system is proposed for the small rotary wing unmanned aircraft to realize stable landing control. Based on the speeded up robust feature algorithm, the stereo vision system can get the feature matching points from the complex environment easily. With the consideration of tilt angle of SRUA system, the corresponding altitude estimation value can be generated by the parallax of ground points, and the stereo vision system can offer accurate altitude information without specialized landing marks. Meanwhile, with the analysis of the characteristic of the on-board altitude sensors, an adaptive weighted average filter algorithm has been developed to adjust the weights of onboard altitude sensors on line. Therefore, the navigation system can generate high performance altitude information even if some onboard sensors are invalid in the autonomous landing process. A series of static tests and autonomous landing tests verify the effectiveness of the altitude navigation system.

AB The global path of capitalist development is continuously transformed as a result of the production and integration of advanced information and communication technologies (ICTS) within various forms of production. The first half of this paper conceptualises ICTS as capital's appropriation and objectification of the productive forces of the general intellect in 'the general artificial intellect; a category that refers to the total processing power of networked ICTS in global society. The second half of the paper analyses Uber's development of the elements of capital's artificial intellect as the cybernetic means of real subsumption in its immaterial production process. The paper concludes that Uber's development of autonomous vehicles is an example of the global trend in transport automation that could raise the organic composition of capital of the transport industry, which I suggest would advance the stage of real subsumption toward a third and final stage of autonomous subsumption.

AB We present a novel compact deep multi-task learning model to handle various autonomous driving perception tasks in one forward pass. The model performs multiple views of semantic segmentation, depth estimation, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) segmentation, and bird's eye view projection simultaneously without being supported by other models. We also provide an adaptive loss weighting algorithm to tackle the imbalanced learning issue that occurred due to plenty of given tasks. Through data pre-processing and intermediate sensor fusion techniques, the model can process and combine multiple input modalities retrieved from RGB cameras, dynamic vision sensors (DVS), and LiDAR placed at several positions on the ego vehicle. Therefore, a better understanding of a dynamically changing environment can be achieved. Based on the ablation study, the model variant trained with our proposed method achieves a better performance. Furthermore, a comparative study is also conducted to clarify its performance and effectiveness against the combination of some recent models. As a result, our model maintains better performance even with much fewer parameters. Hence, the model can inference faster with less GPU memory utilization. Moreover, the result tends to be consistent in 3 different CARLA simulation datasets and 1 real-world nuScenes-lidarseg dataset. To support future research, we share codes and other files publicly at https://github.com/oskarnatan/compact-perception.

AB Trajectory tracking of an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) is essential due to its extensive construction, agriculture, and military applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient, robust model predictive control (RMPC) for the trajectory tracking of a small-scale autonomous bulldozer in the presence of perturbations by unknown but bounded disturbances. The proposed RMPC is designed by considering a linearised tracking error-based model combined with a feed-forward and optimal control action to achieve the proposed trajectory. The presence of a corrective feedback controller as a time-varying finite-time linear quadratic regulator (LQR) suppresses the uncertainties acting on the real system by regulating around the nominal system. Pose estimation, required for control feedback, is based on sensor data fusion performed by an extended Kalman filter (EKF) map-based localiser, which processes inertial measurement unit (IMU) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) measurements. Experiments are performed using a real robot (Husky A200) to validate the proposed control scheme's performance. The experimental results show that the proposed controller can safely track target trajectories with low processing time, small tracking errors, and smooth control actions. Finally, the proposed control scheme is compared with related techniques and outperforms them in tracking accuracy. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work proposes a nonlinear model predictive control-based guidance strategy for unmanned surface vehicles, focused on path following. The application of this strategy, in addition to overcome drawbacks of previous line-of-sight-based guidance laws, intends to enable the application of predictive strategies also to the low-level control, responsible for tracking the references provided by the guidance strategy. The stability and robustness of the proposed strategy are theoretically discussed. Furthermore, given the non-negligible computational cost of such nonlinear predictive guidance strategy, a practical nonlinear model predictive control strategy is also applied in order to reduce the computational cost to a great extent. The effectiveness and advantages of both proposed strategies over other nonlinear guidance laws are illustrated through a complete set of simulations.

AB In this paper, a car-following model considering various driving styles is constructed to fulfill the personalized needs of different users of autonomous vehicles. First, according to a set of selection rules, car-following events are selected from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset, and then through an unsupervised machine learning method, the extracted data are divided into two styles, i.e., conservative and aggressive. Statistical analysis is then conducted to analyze the differences in vehicle speed, acceleration, desired time headway, and so on between both driving styles. Based on the analysis, a car-following model based on model predictive control is designed. Experimental results from testing data show that the proposed car-following models demonstrate different driving styles in terms of safety, comfort, and effectiveness. The conservative driving model is safer and more comfortable than the radical driving model, but the driving efficiency is low.

AB This paper shows mathematical results of three methods, which can be used for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to make transition from one flight leg to another. In paper, we present general equations, which can be used for generating waypoint-switching methods when for experiment purpose mathematical UAV model is used. UAV is modelled as moving dot, which eliminates all of the aerodynamics factors and we can concentrate only on the navigation problems. Lots of attention is dedicated to show possible flight path error values with representation of modelled flight path trajectories and deviations from the flight mission path. All of the modelled flight missions are done in two-dimensional space and all the results are evaluated by looking at Probability Density Function (PDF) values, as we are mostly interested in the probability of the error.

AB UAV accidents have been steadily rising as demand and use of these vehicles increases. A critical examination of UAV accidents reveals that human error is a major cause. Advanced autonomous systems capable of eliminating the need for human piloting are still many years from implementation. There are also many potential applications of UAVs in near Earth environments that would require a human pilot's awareness and ability to adapt. This suggests a need to improve the remote piloting of UAVs. This paper explores the use of motion platforms to augment pilot performance and the use of a simulator system to asses UAV pilot skill. The approach follows studies on human factors performance and cognitive loading. The resulting design serves as a test bed to study UAV pilot performance, create training programs, and ultimately a platform to decrease UAV accidents.

AB In autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially in fully AVs, "drivers" perceive vehicle operation from a passenger's perspective. This study focuses on the perspective change of drivers especially in fully AVs. To investigate the effect of change in perspective on drivers' assessment of AVs, this study conducted a driving simulator experiment and a survey using different samples. The driving simulator experiment was a within-subjects design including 40 participants. The experimental results indicated that although AVs drive exactly the same as the drivers, 85% of these drivers had different assessments for AVs compared to driving themselves (self-AV bias). Among these biased drivers, 80% changed the direction of their assessments (e.g., satisfied with their own driving behaviors but dissatisfied with the same behaviors from the AVs). Additionally, self-AV bias increased with the level of self-evaluation of their own driving skills. The higher the level of self-evaluation, the higher the optimism bias (drivers think they drive better than AVs) of drivers. Thereafter, to show whether and how self-AV bias affects drivers' intuitive acceptance of AVs, a survey was conducted, which included 381 valid questionnaires. The survey results showed that self-AV bias was a critical factor promoting perceived usefulness of AVs; particularly, highly self-AV-biased drivers responded more to the perceived usefulness of AVs. Moreover, drivers who could accept more risky driving behaviors of AVs compared to themselves also perceived AVs to be more useful. The findings from this study provide insights for understanding drivers' assessment and acceptance of AVs' driving behaviors.

ID DESIGN
AB The stochastic nature of public transport systems leads to headway variability and bus bunching, causing both operator and passenger cost to increase significantly. Traditional strategies to counter bus bunching, including bus-holding, stop-skipping, and bus substitution/insertion, suffer from trade-offs and shortcomings. Autonomous modular vehicle (AMV) technology provides an additional level of flexibility in bus dispatching and operations, which can offer significant benefits in mitigating bus bunching compared to strategies available with conventional buses. This paper introduces a novel alternative to stop-skipping by leveraging the new capabilities offered by AMVs (in particular, en-route coupling and decoupling of modular units). We develop a simple bus-splitting strategy that directs a modular bus to decouple into individual units when it experiences a headway longer than a given threshold. We then use a macroscopic simulation to present a proof-of-concept evaluation of the proposed modular strategy compared to a benchmark traditional stop-skipping strategy and the base (no control) case. We find that the proposed strategy outperforms the benchmark in decreasing each of the three travel time components: waiting time, in-vehicle time, and walking time (which it eliminates completely). It therefore reduces the overhead of bus bunching and thus the travel cost by more than twice as much as the benchmark for busy bus lines. Simultaneously, it also reduces headway variability to a comparable degree. Furthermore, we analyze different control thresholds for applying the proposed strategy, and show that it is most effective when applied proactively, i.e. with the control action being triggered even by small headway deviations.

The 15-cm diameter, 250-g robot relies only on onboard sensors (a single camera and an inertial measurement unit) and computers, and can detect, localize, and track moving objects. Our key contributions include the relative pose estimate of a spherical target as well as the planning algorithm, which considers the dynamics of the underactuated robot, the actuator limitations, and the field of view constraints. We show simulation and experimental results to demonstrate feasibility and performance, as well as robustness to abrupt variations in target motion.

AB Progress is reported with an acoustic sensor network that offers the possibility to provide monitoring of nuclear storage ponds. The aim is to create a network that comprises a number of autonomous sensor nodes that communicate and localise using ultrasonic signals. The nodes are less than 20cm dimension and are able to manoeuvre themselves, horizontally and vertically, to selected positions where they can then record measurements of selected parameters. Ultrasonic signal propagation has been explored in a 6m benign test pond with representative clutter. The paper describes progress with communications, localisation and a small autonomous underwater vehicle. Results suggest that localisation might be achieved to an accuracy of about 10cm and data might be communicated up to 1 kbit/s assuming a bit error rate of 10-4.

AB According to vehicle electrification trends, the application of electric motors more often occurs. Therefore, in the aspect of the supply instability preparation for rare-earth materials, research on the rare-earth-free motor is getting more attention. Moreover, the electric motor for the vehicles should have not only high power density but also fast response. Especially, electric motors for advanced driver assistant systems or autonomous driving vehicles should have a fast response speed to secure the driver's safety. This paper introduces the electro-mechanical response improvement design of concentrated flux synchronous motors for vehicle electrification. Improvement design is carried out targeting motors for electric power steering system. The development of the electro-mechanical analytic (EMA) model of the electric motor is firstly explained. Then, based on the developed EMA model, electro-mechanical response modeling is performed. Finally, the speed response improvement design is conducted using the developed EMA model. In addition, the results are validated not only in finite element analysis but also experimentally.

AB Motion planning and path following together constitute a critical part of the decision-making hierarchy in autonomous ground vehicles. One of the simplest instances of this architecture is when the path planner generates waypoints that define a sequence of collision-free line segments from a start location to goal destination and when the vehicle's kinematic model is taken to be Dubin's vehicle. The low-level feedback controller can then be designed by treating the path following problem as a set stabilization problem; one such approach is called transverse feedback linearization (TFL). However, for a Dubin's vehicle with only one input, the direction of traversal along the path is completely determined by the vehicle's initial condition. In this article, we provide easily checkable sufficient conditions that only need to be checked once at run time and a simple systematic design procedure, which guarantees that the robot traverses the path while coming within a user-specified distance of the waypoints; the procedure is also empirically verified.

AB The smooth operation of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) relies heavily on the accurate detection of surrounding objects. Toward this end, this letter presents a novel method for underwater object detection based on the gravity gradient differential and the gravity gradient differential ratio caused by the relative motion between the AUV and the object. Unlike the existing techniques, the proposed method works in a passive manner and achieves AUV invisibility without energy emission. In addition, for the proposed method, no gravity map or gravity gradient map is required, which improves its practicality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than the existing methods.

AB High-resolution (acoustic & video) seabed survey requires deployment of sensors on platforms close to the seabed. The unstructured, harsh and hazardous nature of the ocean environment and close proximity to the seabed and other hazards produces serious problems for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) during the mission. The Mobile & Marine Robotics Research Centre at the University of Limerick is developing a highly manoeuvrable AUV/ROV platform to address the challenges of high-resolution seabed survey in both shallow and deep water. The overall system integrates state-of-the-art survey equipment, a multi-thruster open-frame AUV Tethra and an advanced control system. This paper gives an overview of the overall system including simulation results.

AB Path planning plays a significant role in autonomous navigation for robots in complex environments and hence has been extensively studied for decades. However, the computational time of most existing methods are dependent on the scale and complexity of environment, which leads to the compromise between time efficiency and path quality. To tackle this challenge, deep neural network based (DNN-based) planning methods have been actively explored. However, despite the success of DNN-based 2D planner, 3D path planning, which is a significant primitive for quite a few autonomous robots, is rarely handled by DNNs. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end neural network architecture named Three-Dimensional Path Planning Network (TDPP-Net) to realize DNN-based 3D path planning. Embedding the action decomposition and composition concept, our network predicts 3D actions merely through 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Besides, the computational time of TDPP-Net is almost independent of environmental scale and complexity for each action prediction. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach exhibits remarkable performance for planning real-time paths in unseen 3D environments. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Trajectory tracking for autonomous vehicles is usually solved by designing control laws that make the vehicles track predetermined feasible trajectories based on the trajectory error. This type of approach suffers from the drawback that usually the vehicle dynamics exhibits complex nonlinear terms and significant uncertainties. Toward solving this problem, this work proposes a novel approach in trajectory tracking control for nonholonomic mobile robots. We use a nonlinear model predictive controller to track a given trajectory. The novelty is introduced by using a set of modifications in the robot model, cost function, and optimizer aiming to minimize the steady-state error rapidly. Results of simulations and experiments with real robots are presented and discussed verifying and validating the applicability of the proposed approach in nonholonomic mobile robots.

AB This paper proposes a new tracking controller for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) using the concept of simultaneous quadratic stabilization. The nonlinear underwater vehicle system is viewed as a set of locally linear time invariant systems obtained by linearizing the system equations on the reference trajectory about some discrete points. A single stabilizing controller is then designed for the set of systems so obtained. However this controller requires the exact parameters of the system. Since the hydrodynamic parameters of AUVs are generally not known with sufficient accuracy, the proposed controller is used for the known part of the dynamics and an adaptation algorithm is used to estimate the unknown parameters online and compensate for the rest of the plant dynamics. The proposed controller can thus adaptively handle the complete nonlinear uncertain dynamics of the plant. Simulation results are presented and discussed for a typical AUV.

AB A synthesis of methods from cybernetics and AI yields a concept of intelligence for autonomous mobile systems that integrates closed-loop visual perception and goal-oriented action cycles using spatiotemporal models. In a layered architecture, systems dynamics methods with differential models prevail on the lower, data-intensive levels, but on higher levels, AI-type methods are used. Knowledge about the world is geared to classes of objects and subjects. Subjects are defined as objects with additional capabilities of sensing, data processing, decision making, and control application. Specialist processes for visual detection and efficient tracking of class members have been developed. On the upper levels, individual instantiations of these class members are analyzed jointly in the task context, yielding the situation for decision making. As an application, vertebrate-type vision for tasks in vehicle guidance in naturally perturbed environments was investigated with a distributed PC system. Experimental results with the test vehicle VAMORs are discussed.

AB This paper introduces a Multi-objective Periodic Generalized Directed Rural Postman Problem under Length Restrictions with Intermediate Facilities (MO-PGDRPPLRIF) applied in the metro track inspection routing problem, which is a variant of the Arc Routing Problem (ARP). In the MO-PGDRPPLRIF, arcs are partitioned into given clusters, and each cluster is associated with a service frequency. As the vehicle has limited working hours per day, several trips may be necessary to complete all tasks. The vehicle must stop at an intermediate facility after each trip such that the parking location where the vehicle ends one day is the same as the position where the vehicle starts the next day. The following objectives are considered in the problem: (i) minimizing the total distance; (ii) making time intervals between two adjacent services for clusters with multiple service frequencies as consistent as possible; and (iii) minimizing the number of trips. In this paper, a novel multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, namely Local-Ideal-Points based Autonomous Space Decomposition (LIP-ASD), is developed to address the proposed problem. LIP-ASD employs a space-decomposition scheme to narrow the search space and exclude inferior solutions. The Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO) is embedded to find a satisfactory solution in each decomposed space. The proposed approach is tested through the modified Capacitated ARP (CARP) benchmark instances and a real-world application in Beijing Metro Corporation. Computational results confirm that our solution approach can solve the problem effectively and outperforms the other three state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.

AB The traffic scene understanding is the core technology in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS), and it is becoming increasingly important for smart or autonomous vehicles. The recent methods for traffic scene understanding, such as Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR), Pedestrian Detection, and Vehicle Detection, have three major shortcomings. First, most models are customized for recognizing a specific category of traffic target instead of general traffic targets. Second, as for these recognition modules, the task of traffic scene understanding is to recognize objects rather than make driving suggestions or strategies. Third, numerous independent recognition modules disadvantage to fusing multi-modal information to make a comprehensive decision for driving operation in accordance with complicated traffic scenes. In this paper, we first introduce the image captioning model to alleviate the aforementioned shortcomings. Different from existing methods, our primary idea is to accurately identify all categories of traffic objects and understand traffic scenes by making full use of all information, and making the suggestions or strategy for driving operation in natural language by using Long Short Term Memory network (LSTM) rather than keywords. The proposed solution naturally solves the problems of feature fusion, general object recognition, and low-level semantic understanding. We tested the solution on our created traffic scene image dataset for evaluation of image captioning. Extensive experiments including quantitative and qualitative comparisons demonstrate that the proposed solution can identify more objects and produce higher-level semantic information than the state-of-the-arts.

AB Wireless charging technology presents an ideal fit for autonomous electric vehicles for realizing a fully automated system (vehicle and charger). This article presents a planning optimization analysis for a pilot project of in-route wireless charging infrastructure serving fixed-route on-demand shared automated electric shuttles (SAESs) at Greenville, SC, USA. A single-objective nonlinear mixed integer system planning optimization problem is formulated. A comprehensive cost model representing the overall inductively charged SAESs system is developed, considering road construction, power electronics and materials, traction battery, and installation costs. The optimization problem is solved to determine the best combination of the system key design parameters (number and allocations of wireless chargers, charging power level, track length, and on-board battery capacity) that show the most cost-effective solution and allow the SAESs to achieve charge-sustaining operation. The planning platform incorporates representative simulated traffic data (driving speed and routes) for four SAESs in the Greenville using the Simulation of Urban Mobility tool. These data are fed to a vehicle powertrain model and a wireless charger power model to predict the battery power, energy and state-of-charge profiles, which are provided to the search algorithm to assess the design objectives under specific constraints. The results indicate that implementing high-power (100 kW) wireless charger at a few designated stops for fixed-route SAESs with the proper track length allows the vehicles to realize charge-sustaining operation, infinite range, and zero recharge downtime, with a significant reduction in the on-board battery (36%) and road coverage (69%), at minimum cost.

AB Introduction: Active transport (e.g., walking, cycling, and public transport) is associated with numerous health benefits and is the most environmentally sustainable means of personal transport. The introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is expected to result in wide-scale changes to active transport behaviors. Assessing the likely extent of these changes is important to inform strategies designed to minimize disruptions to active transport resulting from AVs.
   Methods: An online survey was administered to a national sample of 1624 Australians of driving age (16 years and older). Respondents reported their current levels of engagement in walking, cycling, and/or public transport, and how likely they would be to use an AV instead of these activities. Regression models were used to explore how demographic, psychological, and various transport-related factors were associated with the likelihood of substituting AVs for each mode of active transport.
   Results: Substantial minorities of respondents indicated that they would be likely to use AVs instead of walking (18%), cycling (32%), and public transport (48%). The examined factors accounted for significant amounts of variance in each regression model. One factor was significant in all three models: a more favorable general attitude to AVs was associated with a greater likelihood of replacing walking, cycling, and public transport with AV use.
   Conclusions: Overall, the results suggest that AVs could substantially reduce participation in active transport, with corresponding disbenefits for individuals and society. Policies need to be implemented immediately to promote the use of active transport and minimize the migration from active transport to AVs.

AB When modeling decision-making in autonomous vehicles (AVs), only a fraction of the required information is usually available at the start due to the presence of uncertainty in the knowledge of the state of the system and the environment. This article presents a probabilistic modeling framework based on a combination of partially observable Markov decision-process (POMDP) models and heuristics. In this article, POMDPs are expanded and redefined as expandable-POMDPs to account for uncertainty and unexplainable observations. Specifically, this approach incorporates new hidden states in the model and expands associated probability distributions in the model to account for partial knowledge and unexplainable observations. An online policy estimation algorithm is presented. This algorithm employs heuristic search combined with distance-based clustering to estimate long-term rewards in a finite-horizon look-ahead scheme for expandable-POMDPs. Specifically, heuristics are employed in model design and online policy evaluation to circumvent state-space explosion and reduce high computational complexity. Finally, the expandable-POMDP models are employed for designing multiple context-specific models for tactical planning and decision-making by AVs in simulated scenarios characterized by partial observability and uncertainty. One (or more) expandable-POMDP model is invoked when the contextual pattern of the ongoing scenario fits the objective of the tactical planning model.

AB Hundreds of Oil & Gas Industry structures in the marine environment are approaching decommissioning. Inmost areas decommissioning operations will need to be supported by environmental assessment and monitoring, potentially over the life of any structures left in place. This requirement will have a considerable cost for industry and the public. Here we review approaches for the assessment of the primary operating environments associated with decommissioning - namely structures, pipelines, cuttings piles, the general seabed environment and the water column - and show that already available marine autonomous systems (MAS) offer a wide range of solutions for this major monitoring challenge. Data of direct relevance to decommissioning can be collected using acoustic, visual, and oceanographic sensors deployed on MAS. We suggest that there is considerable potential for both cost savings and a substantial improvement in the temporal and spatial resolution of environmental monitoring. We summarise the trade-offs between MAS and current conventional approaches to marine environmental monitoring. MAS have the potential to successfully carry out much of the monitoring associated with decommissioning and to offer viable alternatives where a direct match for the conventional approach is not possible.

AB This paper describes the design and implementation of a fuzzy control system for a car-like autonomous vehicle. The problem addressed is the diagonal parking in a constrained space, a typical problem in motion control of nonholonomic robots. The architecture proposed for the fuzzy controller is a hierarchical scheme which combines seven modules working in series and in parallel. The rules of each module employ the adequate fuzzy operators for its task (making a decision or generating a smoothly varying control output), and they have been obtained from heuristic knowledge and numerical data (with geometric information) depending on the module requirements (some of them are constrained to provide paths of near-minimal lengths). The computer-aided design tools of the environment Xfuzzy 3.0 (developed by some of the authors) have been employed to automate the different design stages: 1) translation of heuristic knowledge into fuzzy rules; 2) extraction of fuzzy rules from numerical data and their tuning to give paths of near-minimal lengths; 3) offline verification of the control system behavior; and 4) its synthesis to be implemented in a true robot and be verified on line. Real experiments with the autonomous vehicle ROMEO 4R (designed and built at the Escuela Superior de Ingenieros, University of Seville, Seville, Spain) demonstrate the efficiency of the described controller and of the methodology followed in its design.

We focus on the structure of singular extremals and their relation to the existence of rank-one kinematic reductions; thereby linking the optimization problem to the inherent geometric framework. Using these kinematic reductions, we provide a solution to the motion planning problem in the under-actuated scenario, or equivalently, in the case of actuator failures. We finish the paper comparing a time optimal trajectory to one formed by a concatenation of pure motions.

AB Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can reconfigure wireless environment to improve channel capacity and extend coverage. In this paper, we develop a reconfigurable wireless relaying system aided by multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-carried intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), where both the significant active and passive beamforming gain brought by base station (BS) and IRS and the flexibility of UAV is exploited to enhance multiuser downlink transmission. Specifically, we jointly optimize UAVs' placement, active beamforming and power allocation at the BS, and passive beamforming at the UAV-IRSs to maximize the weighted sum rate. To address the corresponding optimization problem, we decompose it into several subproblems, which are iteratively optimized. Based on simulation results, the proposed scheme achieves significant performance gains over the benchmark schemes.

AB Increasing electric vehicle (EV) penetration in distribution networks necessitate EV charging coordination. This paper proposes a two-stage EV charging coordination mechanism that frees the distribution system operator (DSO) from extra burdens of EV charging coordination. The first stage ensures that the total charging demand meets facility constraints, and the second stage ensures fair charging welfare allocation while maximizing the total charging welfare via Nash-bargaining trading. A decentralized algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is proposed to protect individual privacy. The proposed mechanism is implemented on the blockchain to enable trustworthy EV charging coordination in case a third-party coordinator is absent. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.

AB Motion control of articulated vehicles composed of a nonholonomic tractor and several passive trailers is a difficult underactuated problem. This paper proposes the application of steering limitations to the tractor to avoid interunit collision during forward motion. This method can be used for systems that combine any type of on-axle and off-axle joints. We propose an algorithm to compute curvature bounds based on the analysis of steady and transient responses. These limitations can be introduced at the path tracking and path planning levels for autonomous navigation. Thus, the tractor can be controlled to follow admissible paths much in the same way as when it does not tow any trailer. The method has been validated experimentally with an off-axle two-trailer setup attached to the tracked mobile robot Auriga-alpha.

AB This paper describes Princeton University's approach to the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge, an off-road race for fully autonomous ground vehicles. The system, Prospect Eleven, takes a simple approach to address the problems posed by the Grand Challenge, including obstacle detection, path planning, and extended operation in harsh environments. Obstacles are detected using stereo vision, and tracked in the time domain to improve accuracy in localization and reduce false positives. The navigation system processes a geometric representation of the world to identify passable regions in the terrain ahead, and the vehicle is controlled to drive through these regions. Performance of the system is evaluated both during the Grand Challenge and in subsequent desert testing. The vehicle completed 9.3 miles of the course on race day, and extensive portions of the 2004 and 2005 Grand Challenge courses in later tests. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB A laudable goal toward achieving autonomous internet of things (IoT) devices would be to use the same circuitry for communication and harvesting energy. One way to achieve it is through simultaneous lightwave and power transfer (SLIPT) that consists of using solar cells to harvest energy and receive information signals. Here, a SLIPT-based system that uses a large area solar panel to harvest energy from light sources and decode data signals is designed. The designed system is equipped with an infrared sensor used to detect the movements of an unmanned aerial vehicle. We equally discuss the wide-scale deployment of IoT devices with SLIPT capability.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are used in many research fields for diverse operations, requiring the system to be safe and efficient. Therefore, the UAV system's robustness and integrity are paramount in its design and operation. For these design and operational requirements, we propose a robot operating system (ROS) based multi-degree of freedom (DOF) flight test framework for the safe development, verification, and validation of UAVs. The developed flight test system includes a test bench capable of moving freely in 4 DOF, an electronic control unit (ECU) for collecting data from sensors and running the operation software, a power supply unit (PSU) to power up each device, an operation software tools developed in ROS for seamless integration of the software and hardware systems, and a wind tunnel for simulating the flight environment. The fidelity of the flight test framework was verified through experimental tests conducted on a rocket-propelled foldable unmanned aerial vehicle under development.

AB Since the analysis of cell coverage faces complex environments in unmanned aerial vehicle base station (UAV-BS) systems, general coverage probability in a typical cell is derived to analyse a UAV-BS multi-tier network, and this coverage probability is closely related with power difference among UAV-BSs, two-dimension (2D) and three-dimension (3D) UAV-BS deployment, and general interference fading models. Especially, closed-form coverage probability expressions are also derived in the form of 2D scenario and 3D scenario, when the interference fading coefficient is assumed to follow a Gamma distribution and an exponential distribution, respectively. It shows that there exists maximum spectral efficiency density (SED) as the BS density increases, and such a BS density achieving the max-SED is independent of noise power, but is affected by various propagation parameters.

AB Trajectory prediction in dynamic and highly interactive scenarios is a critical method for achieving advanced autonomous driving. Maximizing the guidance and constraints pro-vided by high-definition (HD) maps can help improve prediction performance across the board. In this paper, we propose a map-enhanced generative adversarial network (ME -GAN) for vehicle trajectory prediction. The vehicle motion features, map constraints, traffic flow density, and vehicle interactions are comprehensively considered in the generator, and a graph query mechanism is proposed to realize the reuse of the global map. In the dis-criminator, in addition to considering the authenticity of a generated trajectory and whether it is consistent with the historical trajectory, additional map information is intro-duced to establish a matching model between the generated trajectory and the current map. Experiments based on the Argoverse and nuScenes dataset are subsequently per -formed. The experimental results show that our prediction method outperforms state-of -the-art prediction systems, namely, TNT, PRIME and P2T. The strong coupling of the HD map significantly improves the reasonableness of the predicted trajectory.CO 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper addresses the task scheduling and path planning problem for a team of cooperating vehicles performing autonomous deliveries in urban environments. The cooperating team comprises two vehicles with complementary capabilities, a truck restricted to travel along a street network, and a quadrotor micro-aerial vehicle of capacity one that can be deployed from the truck to perform deliveries. The problem is formulated as an optimal path planning problem on a graph and the goal is to find the shortest cooperative route enabling the quadrotor to deliver items at all requested locations. The problem is shown to be NP-hard. A solution is then proposed using a novel reduction to the Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem, for which well-established heuristic solvers exist. The heterogeneous delivery problem contains as a special case the problem of scheduling deliveries from multiple static warehouses. We propose two additional algorithms, based on enumeration and a reduction to the traveling salesman problem, for this special case.

AB Vehicles in the adjacent lane making abrupt lane changes is a common and frequent action during traffic movement. Being aware of adjacent vehicles ahead of time, determining their cut-in intention, monitoring their cut-in trajectory in real time, and actively adjusting following speed are all critical for adaptive cruise systems for vehicles. This study proposes a flexible following-factor-calculation approach that considers the driver's willingness to take risks for the purpose of identifying cut-in intent, predicting trajectory, and narrowing the window for following cruise speed adjustment to improve passenger ride comfort. To begin, a lane-change trajectory prediction algorithm based on driver adventitious factor correction is proposed in order to correctly predict the lane-change trajectory of adjacent vehicles in urban road traffic scenarios. Second, the flexible following factor and the flexible switching factor of the following target are constructed to overcome the influence of the uncertainty caused by internal and external disturbances on the vehicle following the motion process, and to reduce the impact of cut-in events on passenger comfort. An anti-disturbance rejection control and an adaptive cruise controller based on the vehicle's longitudinal inverse dynamics model are proposed in order to compensate for and suppress the internal perturbations caused by the vehicle's internal parameter changes and the random disturbances caused by external road environment changes. The results of simulation and real-world testing showed an average of 28% improvement in passenger comfort.

AB Connectivity and autonomy are considered two of the most promising technologies to improve mobility, fuel consumption, travel time, and traffic safety in the automated transportation industry. These benefits can be realized through vehicle platooning. A vehicle platoon is composed of a group of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) traveling together at consensual speed, following the leading vehicle (leader) while maintaining a prespecified inter-vehicle distance. This paper reviews the different existing control techniques associated with the transitional platoon maneuvers such as merge/split and lane change. Different longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics that are mainly used in the transitional platoon maneuvers are discussed. The most used control algorithms for both longitudinal and lateral control used for transitional platoon maneuvers are reviewed and the advantages and limitations of each control strategy are discussed. The most recent articles on platoon control maneuvers have been analyzed based on the proposed control algorithm, homogeneously or heterogeneously of platoon members, type of platoon maneuver, the aim of control problem, type of implementation, and used simulation tools. This paper also discusses different trajectory planning techniques used in lateral motion control and studies the most recent research related to trajectory planning for automated vehicles and summarizes them based on the used trajectory planning technique, platoon or/and lane change, the type of traffic, and the cost functions. Finally, this paper explores the open issues and directions for future research.

AB To date, the research on agriculture vehicles in general and Agriculture Mobile Robots (AMRs) in particular has focused on a single vehicle (robot) and its agriculture-specific capabilities. Very little work has explored the coordination of fleets of such vehicles in the daily execution of farming tasks. This is especially the case when considering overall fleet performance, its efficiency and scalability in the context of highly automated agriculture vehicles that perform tasks throughout multiple fields potentially owned by different farmers and/or enterprises. The potential impact of automating AMR fleet coordination on commercial agriculture is immense. Major conglomerates with large and heterogeneous fleets of agriculture vehicles could operate on huge land areas without human operators to effect precision farming. In this paper, we propose the Agriculture Fleet Vehicle Routing Problem (AF-VRP) which, to the best of our knowledge, differs from any other version of the Vehicle Routing Problem studied so far. We focus on the dynamic and decentralised version of this problem applicable in environments involving multiple agriculture machinery and farm owners where concepts of fairness and equity must be considered. Such a problem combines three related problems: the dynamic assignment problem, the dynamic 3-index assignment problem and the capacitated arc routing problem. We review the state-of-the-art and categorise solution approaches as centralised, distributed and decentralised, based on the underlining decision-making context. Finally, we discuss open challenges in applying distributed and decentralised coordination approaches to this problem.

AB Automation of vehicles requires a secure, reliable, and real-time on-chip system. These systems also require very high-speed and compact on-chip analog to digital converters (ADC). The conventional ADC cannot fulfill this requirement. In this paper, we proposed a Darlington pair- and source biasing-based high speed, secure, and reliable voltage to time converter (VTC). It is a compact, high-speed design and gives high conversion gain. The source biasing also helps to increase the input voltage range. The conversion gain of the proposed circuit is 101.43ns/v, which is 52 times greater than the gain achieved by state-of-the-art design. It also shows less effect of process variation and bias temperature instability.

AB In this article, we address the problem of motion planning and control at the limits of handling, under locally varying traction conditions. We propose a novel solution method where traction variations over the prediction horizon are represented by time-varying tire force constraints, derived from a predictive friction estimate. A \CFTOClong (\CFTOCshort) is solved in a receding horizon fashion, imposing these time-varying constraints. Furthermore, our method features an integrated sampling augmentation procedure that addresses the problems of infeasibility and sensitivity to local minima that arise at abrupt constraint alterations, for example, due to sudden friction changes. We validate the proposed algorithm on a Volvo FH16 heavy-duty vehicle, in a range of critical scenarios. Experimental results indicate that traction adaptive motion planning and control improves the vehicle's capacity to avoid accidents, both when adapting to low local traction, by ensuring dynamic feasibility of the planned motion, and when adapting to high local traction, by realizing high traction utilization.

AB Modern intelligent transport solutions can achieve an improvement of traffic flow on motorways. With lane-specific measurements and lane-specific control, more measures are possible. Single frequency precise point positioning (PPP) is a newly developed and affordable technique to achieve an improved position accuracy compared with global positioning system (GPS) standalone positioning. GPS-PPP allows for sub-meter accurate positioning, in real time, of vehicles on a motorway. This paper tests this technique in real life; moreover, it presents a methodology to map the lanes on a motorway using data collected by this technique. The methodology exploits the high accuracy and the fact that the most driving is within a lane. In a field test, a GPS-PPP equipped vehicle drives a specific motorway stretch 100 times, for which the GPS-PPP trajectory data are collected. Using these data, the positions and the widths of different lanes are successfully estimated. Comparison with the ground truth shows a dm accuracy. With the parametrized lanes, vehicles can be tracked down to a lane with the GPS-PPP device.

AB We consider a team of autonomous kinematically controlled non-holonomic planar Dubins car-like vehicles. The team objective is to encircle a given target so that all vehicles achieve a common and pre-specified distance from it and are uniformly distributed over the respective circle, and the entire formation rotates around the target with a prescribed angular velocity. The robots do not communicate with each other and any central decision-maker. The sensing capacity of any vehicle is heavily restricted: It has access only to the distance to the target and to the distances to the companion vehicles that are in a given disc sector centered at the vehicle at hand; no robot can distinguish between its companions, and does not know their parameters. A distributed control law is proposed, and mathematically rigorous proofs of its non-local convergence as well as collision avoidance property are presented. The performance of the control law is illustrated by computer simulations and experiments with real robots.

AB In this letter, we consider an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided covert communication system in which the UAV provides downlink transmission to the public user and covert user with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). In the considered system, the covert performance can be effectively enhanced by the mobility of the UAV and the transmission from UAV to the public user. Aiming at improving the covert signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we jointly optimize the hovering height and power allocation of UAV and formulate a signomial programming (SP) problem. To tackle the nonconvex optimization, we develop a successive geometric programming approximation (SGPA) algorithm. The optimal hovering height and power allocation are provided with numerical results and the outperformance of our design is verified.

AB A recently developed application of computer vision is pathfinding in self-driving cars. Semantic scene understanding and semantic segmentation, as subfields of computer vision, are widely used in autonomous driving. Semantic segmentation for pathfinding uses deep learning methods and various large sample datasets to train a proper model. Due to the importance of this task, accurate and robust models should be trained to perform properly in different lighting and weather conditions and in the presence of noisy input data. In this paper, we propose a novel learning method for semantic segmentation called layer-wise training and evaluate it on a light efficient structure called an efficient neural network (ENet). The results of the proposed learning method are compared with the classic learning approaches, including mIoU performance, network robustness to noise, and the possibility of reducing the size of the structure on two RGB image datasets on the road (CamVid) and off-road (Freiburg Forest) paths. Using this method partially eliminates the need for Transfer Learning. It also improves network performance when input is noisy.

AB Aiming at the transportation scheduling problem of unmanned trucks in open-pit mines, an optimization model for transportation scheduling of unmanned trucks in open-pit mines is established, taking the minimum sum of fuel cost, fixed start-up cost, fault maintenance cost and network base station construction and maintenance cost as the objective function, and taking mining amount, crushing amount in crushing field, truck number and truck transportation work as the bundle reduction conditions. By adjusting the position of the encapsulated individual and the optimal encapsulated individual through the parameter position adaptive updating mechanism, the search range of the solution space can be enlarged, so that the algorithm can jump out of the local optimum. This paper analyzes the influence of vehicle clearance on coordinated traffic at intersections under clearance theory, and puts forward the minimum vehicle clearance to meet coordinated traffic. Generate trajectories with behavioral semantics through hierarchical online selection of primitives; Based on the model predictive control algorithm, the motion control module fully considers the execution ability, tracking deviation and control stability of the platform drive motor, and updates the weight coefficient of the control objective function in real time with the help of the semantic attributes of the behavioral motion primitives given by the motion planning, so as to reduce the lateral error, heading error and speed error of the trajectory tracking. Finally, a real vehicle is verified by a medium-sized hybrid unmanned crawler platform, which proves that the proposed intersection coordinated traffic model is feasible in theory, reflecting that the traffic density is a factor that affects the transportation efficiency. Under the condition of meeting the production requirements, reduce the intersection conflict and improve the traffic capacity of the intersection by adopting large-load unmanned mine trucks as much as possible, reducing the number of unmanned mine trucks and the interference between equipment.

AB This paper reports on AnnieWAY, an autonomous vehicle that is capable of driving through urban scenarios and that successfully entered the finals of the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge competition. After describing the main challenges imposed and the major hardware components, we outline the underlying software structure and focus on selected algorithms. Environmental perception mainly relies on a recent laser scanner that delivers both range and reflectivity measurements. Whereas range measurements are used to provide three-dimensional scene geometry, measuring reflectivity allows for robust lane marker detection. Mission and maneuver planning is conducted using a hierarchical state machine that generates behavior in accordance with California traffic laws. We conclude with a report of the results achieved during the competition. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Public littering and discarded trash are, despite the effort being put to limit it, still a serious ecological, aesthetic, and social problem. The problematic waste is usually localised and picked up by designated personnel, which is a tiresome, time-consuming task. This paper proposes a low-cost solution enabling the localisation of trash and litter objects in low altitude imagery collected by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) during an autonomous patrol mission. The objects of interest are detected in the acquired images and put on the global map using a set of onboard sensors commonly found in typical UAV autopilots. The core object detection algorithm is based on deep, convolutional neural networks. Since the task is domain-specific, a dedicated dataset of images containing objects of interest was collected and annotated. The dataset is made publicly available, and its description is contained in the paper. The dataset was used to test a range of embedded devices enabling the deployment of deep neural networks for inference onboard the UAV. The results of measurements in terms of detection accuracy and processing speed are enclosed, and recommendations for the neural network model and hardware platform are given based on the obtained values. The complete system can be put together using inexpensive, off-the-shelf components, and perform autonomous localisation of discarded trash, relieving human personnel of this burdensome task, and enabling automated pickup planning.

AB An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm that self-organizes to provide superior intelligence and overwhelming effects is a promising technology in urban scenarios. Complex terrain constraints of urban environment increase mission planning difficulties, and bring a strong input-output coupling between subproblems of mission planning, which affect the computing performance and effectiveness of the UAV swarm. In this paper, an evolutionary utility prediction matrix (EUPM) method is presented to solve the input-output-coupled mission planning problem for a UAV swarm executing heterogeneous tasks in an urban scenario with complex constraints. A structured framework of urban missions is established with a distributed mission planning architecture. The input-output coupling relationships between the subproblems of mission planning are analyzed in terms of typical urban mission patterns. Modules for the mission planning subproblems are designed with improved input-output coupling relationships. Simulations and hardware-in-loop experiments demonstrate that the EUPM method achieves accurate prediction of the utility and high effective mission planning solutions than the traditional methods.

AB This study proposes a lane detection method based on expressway driving videos through a computer vision-based image processing system without using sensors. Both straight and curved sections can occur on a road, and thus, lanes must be detected by quickly determining such sections. The proposed method detects straight and curved sections that are estimated to be lanes using the Hough transform. When lanes are detected from actual images, the scope of left and right lanes is limited to reduce computational load. In this paper, we propose a lane-detection algorithm using the colour space and a stepwise algorithm for accurate lane detection. To verify the proposed algorithms, we developed a small self-driving vehicle model using a TX-2 board. The experiment results when applying the proposed Hough transform algorithm and lane-detection algorithm using the colour space show that the lane detection rate of vehicles driving on curves at high speed is approximately 96%. Through the extensive simulation results, the proposed algorithm to vehicle black boxes or autonomous driving will help prevent lane departure and reduce accident rates.

ID COLLECTIVE PERCEPTION
AB Automated vehicles make use of multiple sensors to detect their surroundings. Sensors have significantly improved over the years but still face challenges due to the presence of obstacles or adverse weather conditions, among others. Cooperative or collective perception has been proposed to help mitigate these challenges through the exchange of sensor data among vehicles using V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) communications. Recent studies have shown that cooperative perception can complement on-board sensors and increase the vehicle's awareness beyond its sensors field of view. However, cooperative perception significantly increases the amount of information exchanged by vehicles which can degrade the V2X communication performance and ultimately the effectiveness of cooperative perception. In this context, this study conducts first a dimensioning analysis to evaluate the impact of the sensors' characteristics and the market penetration rate on the operation and performance of cooperative perception. The study then investigates the impact of congestion control on cooperative perception using the Decentralized Congestion Control (DCC) framework defined by ETSI. The study demonstrates that congestion control can negatively impact the perception and latency of cooperative perception if not adequately configured. In this context, this study demonstrates for the first time that the combination of congestion control functions at the Access and Facilities layers can improve the perception achieved with cooperative perception and ensure a timely transmission of the information. The results obtained demonstrate the importance of an adequate configuration of DCC for the development of connected and automated vehicles.

AB This article presents the development of a small, radio-controlled (RC) log skidder and also discusses the results of a preliminary investigation into using fuzzy logic for autonomous control of the skidder. Small skidders can reduce the environmental impact of logging and help improve timber stands. With previous small skidders, the operator walked in front of the skidder and reached back with one hand to operate the controls on a handle. The RC skidder allows the operator to be removed from the immediate vicinity of the skidder, thus making a safer operating environment. Field trials of the RC skidder were conducted and are discussed.
   A preliminary investigation into using fuzzy logic with ultrasonic sensors for collision avoidance is also presented. A collision avoidance system would be one component in an overall autonomous control system that would allow the RC skidder to follow skid trails without guidance from the operator A computer simulation is used to model the ultrasonic sensors, and the skidder in a two-dimensional obstacle field. The computer simulations are used with an optimization algorithm to train the fuzzy logic control system.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques implemented at a large scale in intelligent transport systems (ITS), have considerably enhanced the vehicles' autonomous behaviour in making independent decisions about cyber threats, attacks, and faults. While, AI techniques are based on data sharing among the vehicles, it is important to note that sensitive data cannot be shared. Thus, federated learning (FL) has been implemented to protect privacy in vehicles. On the other hand, the integrity of data and the safety of aggregation are ensured by using blockchain technology. This paper applied classification approaches to VANET and ITS cyber-threats detection at the vehicle. Subsequently, by using blockchain and by applying an aggregation strategy to different models, models from the previous step were uploaded in a smart contract. Lastly, we returned the updated models to the vehicles. Furthermore, we conducted an experimental study to measure the effectiveness of the proposed prototype. In this paper, the VeReMi data set was distributed in a balanced manner into five parts in the experimental study. Thus, classification techniques were executed by each vehicle separately, and models were generated. Upon the aggregation of the models in blockchain, they were returned to the vehicles. Lastly, the vehicles updated their decision functions and accessed the precision and accuracy of cyber-threat detection. The results indicated that the precision and accuracy decreased by 7.1% on average with comparable F1-score and recall. Our solution ensures the privacy preservation of vehicles whereas blockchain guarantees the safety of aggregation technique and low gas consumption.

AB The intelligent transportation has been extensively investigated as an enabling technology for ubiquitous data processing and content sharing among vehicles and terrestrial infrastructures. In intelligent transportation systems, numerous vehicles and infrastructures are connected for information and data sharing to enable different operations. Since there are some urban areas that face the traffic congestion or cannot be well served, space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN) can be carried out to provide continuous network connectivity for vehicles. In particular, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are deployed as data collectors to receive data packets from vehicles due to the advantages of high mobility and low operating cost. It is noteworthy that the information freshness is critical to enable services for timely decision, e.g., autonomous driving and accident prevention. In this paper, we develop UAV-aided intelligent transportation systems to enhance the usage of vehicular networks and support low latency vehicular services, where the concept of age-of-information (AoI) is adopted to measure the freshness of data packets of vehicles. Then, the performance of UAV-aided intelligent transportation systems is analyzed in terms of the average AoI. In addition, the deployment of multiple UAVs is optimized to minimize the average peak AoI according to the traffic intensity of vehicles under seamless coverage, finite queue, and coverage probability constraints. To this end, the deployment optimization problem is formulated as a multi-constrained non-convex optimization problem and solved by considering each soft constraint separately. Simulation results show that our proposed system can provide timely data transmission.

ID BOUNDARY DETECTION; DESIGN
AB Autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems are predicted to provide higher safety and reduce fuel and energy consumption and road traffic emissions. Lane detection and tracking are the advanced key features of the advanced driver assistance system. Lane detection is the process of detecting white lines on the roads. Lane tracking is the process of assisting the vehicle to remain in the desired path, and it controls the motion model by using previously detected lane markers. There are limited studies in the literature that provide state-of-art findings in this area. This study reviews previous studies on lane detection and tracking algorithms by performing a comparative qualitative analysis of algorithms to identify gaps in knowledge. It also summarizes some of the key data sets used for testing algorithms and metrics used to evaluate the algorithms. It is found that complex road geometries such as clothoid roads are less investigated, with many studies focused on straight roads. The complexity of lane detection and tracking is compounded by the challenging weather conditions, vision (camera) quality, unclear line-markings and unpaved roads. Further, occlusion due to overtaking vehicles, high-speed and high illumination effects also pose a challenge. The majority of the studies have used custom based data sets for model testing. As this field continues to grow, especially with the development of fully autonomous vehicles in the near future, it is expected that in future, more reliable and robust lane detection and tracking algorithms will be developed and tested with real-time data sets.

AB Developing an autonomous driving system which can generate human-like actions requires the ability to utilize the basic driving skills learned from the driving data. The efficiency of the algorithm can be significantly improved if we can decompose the complex driving tasks into motion primitives (MPs) which represent the elementary composition of driving skills. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to represent MPs, extract MPs from unlabeled driving data, and then connect the learned MPs in the established library. By applying a probabilistic inference based on an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and initial segmentation, the extraction method segments the observed trajectories while learning a set of MPs represented by the modified dynamic movement primitives (DMPs). Moreover, the proposed connection algorithm transforms the connection problem into the re-representation problem of the MP sequence. This paper demonstrates that the modified DMP method can not only represent the driver's trajectory with acceptable accuracy but also have strong generalization ability. We also present how to utilize the mutual dependency between the representation and extraction to achieve MP segmentation and MP library establishment. Besides, this paper shows how the proposed connection algorithm correlates the independent MPs in the sequence to ensure a smooth transition and evaluates the tracking accuracy. The results show that the proposed method realizes the extraction of MPs and the re-generation of trajectory by making use of the interdependence relationship that is often neglected between the representation of a single MP, extraction of different types of MP and combination of multiple MPs.

AB An autonomous underwater vehicle (Seaglider) has been used to estimate marine primary production (PP) using a combination of irradiance and fluorescence vertical profiles. This method provides estimates for depth-resolved and temporally evolving PP on fine spatial scales in the absence of ship-based calibrations. We describe techniques to correct for known issues associated with long autonomous deployments such as sensor calibration drift and fluorescence quenching. Comparisons were made between the Seaglider, stable isotope (C-13), and satellite estimates of PP. The Seaglider-based PP estimates were comparable to both satellite estimates and stable isotope measurements.

AB Advances in cellular technology are a key driver of the growing automotive vehicle-to-everything (V2X) market. In V2X communications, information from sensors and other sources travels via high-bandwidth, low-latency, high-reliability links, paving the way to fully autonomous driving and intelligent mobility. With the future adoption of 5G and beyond (5G&B) networks, V2X is likely to generate a huge volume of data, which encourages the use of edge computing and pushes the system to learn the model locally to support real-time applications. However, the edge computing paradigm raises concerns about the security and privacy of local nodes (e.g., vehicles) and the increased risk of cyberattacks. In this article, we identify open research questions, key requirements, and potential solutions to provide cyber resilience in V2X communications.

AB A total of 19% of generation capacity in California is offered by PV units and over some months, more than 10% of this energy is curtailed. In this research, a novel approach to reducing renewable generation curtailment and increasing system flexibility by means of electric vehicles' charging coordination is presented. The presented problem is a sequential decision making process, and is solved by a fitted Q-iteration algorithm which unlike other reinforcement learning methods, needs fewer episodes of learning. Three case studies are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. These cases include aggregator load following, ramp service and utilization of non-deterministic PV generation. The results suggest that through this framework, EVs successfully learn how to adjust their charging schedule in stochastic scenarios where their trip times, as well as solar power generation are unknown beforehand.

AB This paper proposes a two-stage trajectory planning method for self-driving vehicles (SDVs) in intersection scenarios with uncertain social circumstances while considering other traffic participants, which are human-driving vehicles (HDVs) with different driving styles. The mixture-of-experts approach is first utilized to learn from human-driving trajectory data to construct a multimodal motion planner, which uses a Transformer to model the interactions between vehicles by explicitly considering their driving styles to facilitate the integrated network to achieve scene-consistent multimodal trajectory prediction and candidate trajectory generation. Second, based on the generated trajectories for the SDV and the predicted trajectories for the other HDVs, each candidate planning trajectory is evaluated via a safety-balanced value function. After that, the trajectory with the highest value is selected for implementation. Such a method plans a safe and efficient driving trajectory in complex and uncertain scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the designed method as well as the robustness and reasonableness of the SDVs' maneuver decisions at an intersection considering the behavioral dynamics of HDVs.

   reactive collision avoidance
AB The large-scale of unmanned aerial vehicle applications has escalated significantly within the last few years, and the current research is slowly hinting at a move from single vehicle applications to multivehicle systems. As the number of agents operating in the same environment grows, conflict detection and resolution becomes one of the most important factors of the autonomous system to ensure the vehicles' safety throughout the completion of their missions. The work presented in this paper describes the implementation of the novel distributed reactive collision avoidance algorithm proposed in the literature, improved to fit a swarm of quadrotor helicopters. The original method has been extended to function in dense and crowded environments with relevant spatial obstacle constraints and deconfliction manoeuvres for high number of vehicles. Additionally, the collision avoidance is modified to work in conjunction with a dynamic close formation flight scheme. The solution presented to the conflict detection and Resolution problem is reactive and distributed, making it well suited for real-time applications. The final avoidance algorithm is tested on a series of crowded scenarios to test its performances in close quarters.

AB This paper studies the real-time parameter estimation and adaptive tracking control problem for a six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as an under-actuated system. A virtual proportional derivative (PD) is proposed to maintain position dynamics. Two adaptive control schemes are designed and compared to maintain the attitude dynamics of UAV while several parameters of UAV are unknown. In the first scheme, a classical adaptive scheme using the certainty equivalence principle is extended and designed for tracing control of the systems with unknown time-varying parameters. To improve the performance of the first scheme, a new control scheme is designed in the second scheme by proposing additional continuous function to handle the unknown parameters. An additional robust term is designed in both schemes to handle the perturbation caused by unknown time-varying parameters. The rigorous analytical proof and numerical simulation analysis are provided to support the efficacy of the proposed controller.

TI Signalized Intersection Performance with Automated and Conventional

ID TRAJECTORIES
AB Signal control devices have been continuously evolving to make green assignments more responsive to traffic. Recent advances in connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) provide new opportunities to achieve higher performance levels for signalized intersections through an increased coordination level between vehicles and control devices. This study compares two state-of-the-art intersection management algorithms (IMAs) for CAVs and conventional vehicles (CNVs) to an actuated signal control system (ASCS). The two IMAs, the intelligent intersection control algorithm (IICA) and hybrid autonomous intersection management (H-AIM), are designed to enhance the efficiency of intersections by leveraging vehicle automation and connectivity. Our results show that the performance of both IICA and H-AIM improves as the CAV penetration rate increases. H-AIM attains lower average travel times than the state-of-the-practice ASCS only at a CAV penetration rate of 90% and greater. IICA, which jointly optimizes signal phase and timing (SPaT) and CAV trajectories, achieves the best average travel times and throughput for a wide range of CAV ratios. H-AIM yields lower average travel time and higher throughput compared to IICA at penetration rates close to 100%. (C) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB The growing need for high-performance controllers in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving motivated the development of formal safety verification techniques. In this letter, we design and implement a predictive safety filter that is able to maintain vehicle safety with respect to track boundaries when paired alongside any potentially unsafe control signal, such as those found in learning-based methods. A model predictive control (MPC) framework is used to create a minimally invasive algorithm that certifies whether a desired control input is safe and can be applied to the vehicle, or that provides an alternate input to keep the vehicle in bounds. To this end, we provide a principled procedure to compute a safe and invariant set for nonlinear dynamic bicycle models using efficient convex approximation techniques. To fully support an aggressive racing performance without conservative safety interventions, the safe set is extended in real-time through predictive control backup trajectories. Applications for assisted manual driving and deep imitation learning on a miniature remote-controlled vehicle demonstrate the safety filter's ability to ensure vehicle safety during aggressive maneuvers.

AB Cooperation between multiple autonomous vehicles requires inter-vehicle communication, which in many scenarios must be established over an ad-hoc wireless network. This paper proposes an optimization-based approach to the deployment of such mobile robotic networks. A primal-dual gradient descent algorithm jointly optimizes the steady-state positions of the robots based on the specification of a high-level task in the form of a potential field, and routes packets through the network to support the communication rates desired for the application. The motion planning and communication objectives are tightly coupled since the link capacities depend heavily on the relative distances between vehicles. The algorithm decomposes naturally into two components, one for position optimization and one for communication optimization, coupled via a set of Lagrange multipliers. Crucially and in contrast to previous work, our method can rely on on-line evaluation of the channel capacities during deployment instead of a prespecified model. In this case, a randomized sampling scheme along the trajectories allows the robots to implement the algorithm with minimal coordination overhead.

AB A pair of two-camera omni-imaging devices is designed for use on the roof of a video surveillance vehicle, and corresponding 3-D vision-based techniques for real-time security surveillance around the vehicle are proposed, which may be used to monitor passing-by persons around the vehicle. First, the design of the pair of two-camera omni-imaging devices, each device consisting of two omnicameras, with their optical axes vertically aligned, is described. Then, a new analytic technique for fast 3-D space data acquisition that is based on a panomapping method for image-to-world space transformation, as well as the rotational invariance property of the omni-image, is proposed. Techniques for constructing top-and perspective-view images for the convenient observation of the monitored environment are also proposed. Finally, 3-D vision techniques for automatically detecting passing-by persons and computing their locations and body heights are proposed, followed by experimental results, which show the precision and feasibility of the proposed techniques.

AB This paper discusses requirements for autonomy and communications in maritime environments through two use cases which are sourced from military scenarios: Mine Counter Measures (MCM) and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW). To address these requirements, this work proposes a service-oriented architecture that breaks the typical boundaries between the autonomy and the communications stacks. An initial version of the architecture has been implemented and its deployment during a field trial done in January 2019 is reported. The paper discusses the achieved results in terms of system flexibility and ability to address the MCM and ASW requirements.

AB This paper addresses the problem of path planning in strong current fields. In such situations, existing approaches are subject to incorrectness and incompleteness issues. That is, they may return physically infeasible paths or no path at all, even if a feasible path exists. That is why we propose here a new approach called the sliding wavefront expansion. This algorithm, which combine an appropriate cost function and continuous optimization techniques, guarantees the existence of a path with an arbitrary precision. The validity and the global optimality of the path are theoretically proven. Simulation results on realistic environments, which is based on actual wind charts, are also provided.

AB Tracking maneuvering vehicles in complex dynamic environment is a challenging problem for advanced driver assistance system and autonomous driving systems. Most conventional vehicle tracking algorithms can not model the vehicle dynamic exactly because of the uncertain moving behavior. However, due to the on-road capability, vehicles have to subject to various constraints imposed by traffic rules and roads. Taking advantage of those context information can refine and improve the performance of tracking as it provides additional prior information for vehicles' dynamic behavior. To achieve this goal, this paper presents a novel context-enhanced tracking approach that exploits the context information to reduce the uncertainty of dynamic estimation. A new context-based sojourn-time dependent semi-Markov (STDM) model, called sojourn-time dependent semi-Markov variable structure interacting multiple model (STDM-VSIMM), is proposed to describe the vehicle's longitudinal acceleration process. In order to cope with the context information into STDM model, a context-based Bayesian network is presented to replace the fixed model transition probabilities with sojourn-time dependent transition probabilities. Compared with traditional interacting multiple model tracking with fixed transition probability, this adaptation switching strategy makes the vehicle motion sequence closer to the natural behavior and improve the tracking performance. Furthermore, a novel pseudo-measurement is constructed to formulate the road-map constraint in tracking process for reducing uncertain on mobility constraints. Simulation results shows that the proposed STDM-VSIMM can achieve better performance after considering the context.

ID SECURITY; ARCHITECTURE; NETWORKS; PROTOCOL
AB The development of the wireless Internet environment enables smart devices to be interconnected in various environments to provide convenient services to users. Specifically, in connected vehicle and smart home, the infotainment system and home electronics are connected to the Internet to individually provide services to users. The connected vehicle uses the display panel to show users music, video, navigation, and so on desired, or to develop a service that reduces the burden of driving and allows other activities by autonomous vehicles. However, these services are designed and developed independently on the platform and are not suitable for the concept of residential space of the future society. In this article, we propose a smart life platform by combining the concepts of connected vehicle and smart home into one platform. It also provides the SLP-MCAF to provide secure services within the platform. The SLP-MCAF strongly reinforces the authentication of objects and introduces clusters to improve availability so that services are not separated from the automobile or home, and services are continuous. Through simulation, we demonstrate the stability and efficiency of the proposed platform.

AB Vessel maintenance entails periodic visual inspections of the internal and external parts of the hull in order to detect the typical defective situations affecting metallic structures, such as coating breakdown, corrosion, cracks, etc. The main goal of project MINOAS is the automation of the inspection process, currently undertaken by human surveyors, by means of a fleet of robotic agents. This paper overviews an approach to the inspection problem based on an autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) which, as part of this fleet, is in charge of regularly supplying images that can teleport the surveyor from a base station to the areas of the hull to be inspected. The control software approach adopted for the MAV is fully described, with a special emphasis on the self-localization capabilities of the vehicle. Experimental results showing the suitability of the platform to the application are as well reported and discussed.

AB This study presents a shallow and robust road segmentation model. The computer-aided real-time applications, like driver assistance, require real-time and accurate processing. Current studies use Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) for road segmentation. However, DCNN requires high computational power and lots of labeled data to learn abstract features for deeper layers. The deeper the layer is, the more abstract information it tends to learn. Moreover, the prediction time of the DCNN network is an important aspect of autonomous vehicles. To overcome these issues, a Multi-feature View-based Shallow Convolutional Neural Network (MVS-CNN) is proposed that utilizes the abstract features extracted from the explicitly derived representations of the input image. Gradient information of the input image is used as additional channels to enhance the learning process of the proposed deep learning architecture. The multi-feature views are fed to a fully-connected neural network to accurately segment the road regions. The testing accuracy demonstrates that the proposed MVS-CNN achieved an improvement of 2.7% as compared to baseline CNN consisting of only RGB inputs. Furthermore, the comparison of the proposed method with the popular semantic segmentation network (SegNet) has shown that the proposed scheme performs better while being more efficient during training and evaluation. Unlike traditional segmentation techniques, which are based on the encoder-decoder architecture, the proposed MVS-CNN consists of only the encoder network. The proposed MVS-CNN has been trained and validated with two well-known datasets: the KITTI Vision Benchmark and the Cityscapes dataset. The results have been compared with the state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. The proposed MVS-CNN outperforms and shows supremacy in terms of model accuracy, processing time, and segmentation accuracy. Based on the experimental results, the proposed architecture can be considered as an efficient road segmentation architecture for autonomous vehicle systems.

AB This paper presents a novel design of control algorithms for lane change assistance and autonomous driving on highways, based on recent results in Scenario Model Predictive Control (SCMPC). The basic idea is to account for the uncertainty in the traffic environment by a small number of future scenarios, which is intuitive and computationally efficient. These scenarios can be generated by any model-based or data-based approach. The paper discusses the SCMPC design procedure, which is simple and can be generalized to other control challenges in automated driving, as well as the controller's robustness properties. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the SCMPC algorithm and its performance in lane change situations on highways.

AB This paper considers the problem of position tracking control of the autonomous underwater gliders, which operates under the environment of model uncertainties and external disturbances. The motion of the glider is controlled by ballast mass and moving mass, which have limited dynamic range. An adaptive control system for position tracking based on filtered backstepping is proposed, and neural networks and sliding mode control are used to improve robustness. Next, using Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved that all the signals are bounded and tracking errors eventually converge to a neighborhood of zero. The presented controller can be easily put into practice without the requirement to know the parameters of the glider and the value of external environ-mental disturbances. Finally, the effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed control system are verified by simulation results.

DE Configuration estimation; full-size autonomous tractor-trailers'
   vehicle; industrial application; motion planning
AB This brief presents real-time configuration estimation and motion planning for the industrial tractor-trailers vehicle composed of a full-scale car-like tractor and multiple full trailers. For the real-life vehicle, determining the configuration is challenging. With only on-tractor sensors, we solve this problem by fusing information from system dynamics propagation, geometrical constraints among the articulated units, and matching with the prebuilt environment map. The solution is efficiently achieved by formulating and solving a maximum a posterior (MAP) estimation problem in the pose-graph optimization framework. With the complicated tractor-trailers' structure, small mismatch between actual and planned trajectories is crucial to inherit obstacle-free guarantee from planning to execution. We consider the dynamics and focus on facilitating the reduction of the mismatch by proposing a controller-based smoothing method to perform online motion planning. The given waypoint path is smoothed by forward propagation using a deliberately designed controller to generate the trajectory. The efficiently computed trajectories are also obstacle-free and dynamically feasible. The controller is also applied in execution to precisely reproduce the planned system evolvement. We demonstrate the performance with the real-life industrial tractor-trailers' vehicle.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB High-precision vehicle trajectory prediction can enable autonomous vehicles to provide a safer and more comfortable trajectory planning and control. Unfortunately, current trajectory prediction methods have difficulty extracting hidden driving features across multiple time steps, which is important for long-term prediction. In order to solve this shortcoming, a temporal pattern attention-based trajectory prediction network, named TP2Net, was proposed, and vehicle of interest inception was established to construct an interaction model among vehicles. Experimental results show a 15% improvement in predictive performance over the previous best method under a 5-s prediction horizon. Moreover, in order to explain why temporal pattern attention was adopted and demonstrate its ability to extract hidden features that are intuitive to human beings, a layer interpretation module was included in TP2Net to quantify the mutual information contained between the input and the intermediate layer output tensor. The results of experiments using naturalistic trajectory datasets indicated that temporal pattern attention can extract three important stages in lane changing, showing that temporal pattern attention can effectively extract hidden features and improve prediction accuracy.

AB Through shared real-time traffic information and perception of complex environments, connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are endowed with global decision-making capabilities far beyond that of human drivers. Given more traffic lights information, this planning ability can be greatly strengthened. This study proposed an adaptive speed planning method of CAVs based on multi-light trained deep reinforcement learning (DRL), aiming to improve the fuel economy and comfort of CAVs. By setting a reasonable reward function, the training algorithm takes the key environmental information received by the vehicle as inputs, and finally outputs the acceleration that maximizes the cumulative reward. The results show that the trained DRL agent can adapt to variable scenarios with traffic lights, and quickly solve the approximate optimal speed trajectory. Multi-light DRL models save 6.79% fuel compared with single-light ones and have better performance on fuel economy and computational efficiency than a non-RL method using multi-light optimization.

AB The ultimate goal of self-driving technologies is to offer a safe and human-like driving experience. As one of the most important enabling functionalities, trajectory planning has been extensively studied from the perspective of safety. However, human-like trajectory planning on curved roads has rarely been studied. In this paper, we characterize and model human driving using extensive experimental driving collected on an urban curved road with 30 participants (10 experienced and 20 novice drivers) and five vehicles of different types. Differential global positioning system (GPS) is used to measure vehicle positions in high precision. We study factors that affect the driving trajectory, including vehicle speed, road curvature, and sight distance. We find that the human drivers typically do not follow lane centerline and the human-driven trajectories are very different from planners like rapidly exploring random tree (RRT). To generate human-like driving trajectory, we develop a data-driven trajectory model using general regression neural network (GRNN). The model was validated in various cases with promising performance.

AB Recently, new research activities have emerged for controlling traffic. Since future vehicles will travel autonomously and communicate with their surrounding environment, they will then be able to negotiate the right-of-way at intersections [cooperative intersection management (CIM)] as well as reserve their itinerary (road reservation). Both concepts, i.e., CIM and road reservation, are very promising for relieving traffic congestion. The scope of this paper is to prevent deadlock under real-time conditions, by taking advantage of these two concepts. This paper presents an appropriate graph to model the network of intersections and a sufficient condition for obtaining deadlock-free traffic with a specified route from their origin to their destination. In addition, it proposes a hierarchical approach in which a network server, intersection servers, and vehicles contribute to improving the traffic condition. Simulations were performed on a network of 25 interconnected intersections, as well as, on a real urban network to prove the effectiveness of the model. The results are presented and discussed.

AB With the rapid development of 5G technology, mobile applications such as autonomous driving, video streaming and vehicle online games are constantly emerging and data exchanges and service requests for portable terminal devices are increasing. The expeditious growth of data has brought a heavy burden to the roadside units (RSUs) and networks, the cellular networks cannot maintain the user's service quality. At present, vehicle fog computing is an effective method to solve the above problems in vehicle networks. However, the high mobility of vehicles and the complexity of traffic have brought great challenges to communication and computing in vehicle fog computing. To tackle the aforementioned problems, at first, a vehicle movement model VMM is presented to adapt the dynamics of vehicles in a traffic environment. The model uses four-lane dual carriageway to simulate the urban traffic environment. Next, in order to improve user's service quality (minimize the response time of the tasks), we propose KMM algorithm under the tasks information is known. It uses a two-time selection mechanism to select the offload server and uses the KuhnMunkras algorithm for the final decision. At last, the GMDC algorithm is proposed to adapt the dynamics of traffic environment. In this algorithm, the user vehicles appear randomly, we find a feasible offload server for it through 2 selections, and finally use the greedy algorithm to determine the most suitable server. Experimental results show that compared with the TOPM algorithm, our algorithm increases the task offloading rate by 5% and reduces the utilization rate of RSUs by 45% while improving the response time by 3%.

AB Next-generation advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) for advanced/autonomous driving are expected to increasingly use wireless connectivity such as V2V and V2I to improve the coverage, particularly in the locations where a vehicle's camera or radar is ineffective. However, using shared sensing data raises grave concerns about the truthfulness of information reported by unreliable stakeholders. For example, a transmitting vehicle may deliberately disseminate false locations to the surrounding receivers. Trusting the data, the automatic control systems in such connected receivers can be trapped to change to a wrong lane or accelerate unexpectedly, and then potentially lead to a crash. This work introduces a novel approach to support a host vehicle in verifying the motion behavior of a target vehicle and then the truthfulness of sharing data in cooperative vehicular communications. Initially, at the host vehicle, the detection system recreates the motion behavior of the target vehicle by extracting the positioning information from the V2V received messages. Furthermore, the next states of that vehicle are predicted based on the unscented Kalman filter. Unlike prior studies, the checkpoints of the predicted trajectory in the update stage are periodically corrected with a new reliable measurement source, namely 5 G V2V multi-array beamforming localization. If there is any inconsistency between the estimated position and the corresponding reported one from V2V, the target vehicle will be classified as an abnormal one. The simulation results demonstrate that our method can achieve accuracy over 0.97 in detecting abnormal reports, including those from collusion and Sybil attacks.

AB Driving behavior is an important aspect of maintaining and sustaining safe transport on the roads. It also directly affects fuel consumption, traffic flow, public health, and air pollution along with psychology and personal mental health. For advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs) and autonomous vehicles, predicting driver behavior helps to facilitate interaction between ADAS and the human driver. Consequently, driver behavior prediction has emerged as an important research topic and has been investigated largely during the past few years. Often, the investigations are based on simulators and controlled environments. Driving behavior can be inferred using control actions, visual monitoring, and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. This study leverages the IMU data recorded using a smartphone placed inside the vehicle. The dataset contains the accelerometer and gyroscope data recorded from the real traffic environment. Extensive experiments are performed regarding the use of a different set of features, the combination of original and derived features, and binary versus multiclass classification problems; a total of six scenarios are considered. Results reveal that "timestamp" is the most important feature and using it with accelerometer and gyroscope features can lead to a 100% accuracy for driver behavior prediction. Without using the "timestamp" feature, the number of wrong predictions for "slow" and "normal" classes is high due to the feature space overlap. Although derived features can help elevate the performance of the models, the models show inferior performance to that of using the "timestamp" feature. Deep learning models tend to show poor performance than machine learning models where random forest and extreme gradient boosting machines show a 100% accuracy for multiclass classification.

TI Keypoints-Based Deep Feature Fusion for Cooperative Vehicle Detection of

LA English
DT Article
DE Sensor fusion; sensor networks; object detection; segmentation and
   categorization
AB Sharing collective perception messages (CPM) between vehicles is investigated to decrease occlusions so as to improve the perception accuracy and safety of autonomous driving. However, highly accurate data sharing and low communication overhead is a big challenge for collective perception, especially when real-time communication is required among connected and automated vehicles. In this letter, we propose an efficient and effective keypoints-based deep feature fusion framework built on the 3D object detector PV-RCNN, called Fusion PV-RCNN (FPV-RCNN for short), for collective perception. We introduce a high-performance bounding box proposal matching module and a keypoints selection strategy to compress the CPM size and solve the multi-vehicle data fusion problem. Besides, we also propose an effective localization error correction module based on the maximum consensus principle to increase the robustness of the data fusion. Compared to a bird's-eye view (BEV) keypoints feature fusion, FPV-RCNN achieves improved detection accuracy by about 9% at a high evaluation criterion (IoU 0.7) on the synthetic dataset COMAP dedicated to collective perception. In addition, its performance is comparable to two raw data fusion baselines that have no data loss in sharing. Moreover, our method also significantly decreases the CPM size to less than 03 KB, and is thus about SO times smaller than the BEV feature map sharing used in previous works. Even with further decreased CPM feature channels, i. e., from 128 to 32, the detection performance does not show apparent drops. The code of our method is available at https://github.com/YuanYunshuang/FPV_RCNN.

AB Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) are rapidly emerging as a viable alternative form of public transportation with the potential to provide adequate and user-friendly, on-demand services without having vehicle ownership. It has been argued that SAVs could revolutionize transportation systems and our current way of life. Although SAVs are likely to be introduced in developed countries first, there is little doubt that they would also have a significant effect and enormous market in developing nations. This study aimed to investigate the factors that influence public acceptance of SAVs, as well as the current public attitude toward SAVs, in two developing countries, namely, Pakistan and China. A stated preference survey was conducted to understand respondents' travel patterns, preferences, and sociodemographic data. A total of 910 valid responses were gathered: 551 from Lahore, Pakistan, and 359 from Dalian, China. A multinomial logit model and a mixed multinomial logit model with panel effect were used for data analysis. The results suggested that generic attributes, such as respondents' waiting time, travel time, and travel cost were found to be significant in both cities. The results indicate that sociodemographic characteristics, such as education, income, travel frequency in a week, and people who had driver's licenses, are significantly correlated with respondents' interest in using SAV in Lahore. The results also showed that people who had a private car indicated a greater interest in SAVs in Dalian. The study provides a new perspective to understand the public preferences toward SAVs in developing countries with different economies and cultures, as well as a benchmark for policymakers to make effective policies for the future implementation of SAVs.

AB Interest in the electrification of agricultural vehicles is increasing along with growing interest in autonomous vehicles. Individual technologies have been well-explored, but not their combined use and the effects on agricultural fieldwork. In this study, cost analysis was conducted based on a simulated vehicle system with 50 kW self-driving battery electric drive (BED) tractors. The analysis included battery degradation due to cycling and the cost of inadequate machine capacity, as these factors are suspected to be problems for electric tractors. A dynamic discrete-event vehicle system model, a linear timeliness model and a one-dimensional battery cell ageing model were assumed. Costs obtained were compared with those of contemporary manned diesel-based systems. BED systems had equal or lower annual costs compared to conventional manned diesel-based systems; this was due to lower costs for fuel and maintenance, while providing adequate capacity and lower energy usage. Sensitivity analysis showed that operating costs were of greater significance than investment costs. The generally more expensive investment costs of BED systems were outweighed by the reduced operating costs for several different BED system systems. Battery degradation costs and timeliness were influential, but not sufficient to make the system uncompetitive. The synergistic effect of vehicular autonomy and BED outweighed several of the drawbacks of BED systems, such as frequent recharging, increased transport and reduced consecutive work time. ? 2021 The Authors.

Also, a unified framework basis for the design/analysis of vectorial BSMC, as well as sliding mode control and backstepping control for a system in lower triangular block form is derived. The design framework makes the theoretical-based comparative analysis of performances/robustness easier between the three nonlinear control approaches. Simulation results for the positioning and tracking of the autonomous airship illustrate the proposal.

AB Localization in GPS-denied environments has become a bottleneck problem for small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Smartphones equipped with multi-sensors and multi-core processors provide a choice advantage for small UAVs for their high integration and light weight. However, the built-in phone sensor has low accuracy and the phone storage and computing resources are limited, which make the traditional localization methods unable to be readily converted to smartphone-based ones. The paper aims at exploring the feasibility of the phone sensors, and presenting a real-time, less memory autonomous localization method based on the phone sensors, so that the combination of "small UAV+smartphone" can operate in GPS-denied areas regardless of the overload problem. Indoor and outdoor flight experiments are carried out, respectively, based on an off-the-shelf smartphone and a XAircraft 650 quad-rotor platform. The results show that the precision performance of the phone sensors and real-time accurate localization in indoor environment is possible.

AB During the last decades, with the increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), applications that require automatic processing have been growing. One relevant process is the automatic estimation of digital elevation models (DEMs) for specific areas, for example, to support autonomous navigation. In many cases, autonomous flights are desired. Successful autonomous aerial navigation is dependent on several factors, such as UAV position information. In this case, some methods can be employed, combining Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) with Inertial Navigation Systems (INSs). When no GNSS and INS signals are available, computer vision has been an alternative for the UAV position estimation. This letter presents a novel approach to automatically estimate DEM from aerial images. Its major contribution is the use of characteristic points, the Zernike Moment Algorithm (ZMA), and the particle collision algorithm to find the correspondences between aerial images.

AB Sampling-based, search-based, and optimization-based motion planners are just some of the different approaches developed for motion planning problems. Given the wide variety of application tackled by autonomous mobile manipulators, the question "which planner to choose" may be tough. In this paper, we review the state of the art of the most common approaches, and present a set of benchmarks with the aim to provide not only a theoretical review but also a qualitative/quantitative comparison of the algorithms. Our purpose is to provide an insight and analyze their performance with respect to different metrics. The results are based on an Underwater Vehicle Manipulator System UVMS, although they can be extended to terrestrial and aerial robots as well. The paper uses these results to formalize a set of guidelines for the selection process of the most appropriate approach, for a given problem/requirements. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Characterising Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory trajectories for

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
LA English

DE Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory; Vehicle-to-infrastructure
   communication; Connected vehicles; Trajectory control
ID VEHICLE
AB Conceptually, a Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) system suggests speeds to vehicles, allowing them to pass through an intersection during the green interval. In previous papers, a single speed is computed for each vehicle in a range between acceptable minimum and maximum values (for example between standstill and the speed limit). This speed is assumed to be constant until the beginning of the green interval, and sent as advice to the vehicle. The goal is to optimise for a particular objective, whether it be minimisation of emissions (for environmental reasons), fuel usage or delay. This paper generalises the advice given to a vehicle, by optimising for delay over the entire trajectory instead of suggesting an individual speed, regardless of initial conditions - time until green, distance to intersection and initial speed. This may require multiple acceleration manoeuvres, so the advice is sent as a suggested acceleration at each time step. Such advice also takes into account a suitable safety constraint, ensuring that vehicles are always able to stop before the intersection during a red interval, thus safeguarding against last-minute signal control schedule changes. While the algorithms developed primarily minimise delay, they also help to reduce fuel usage and emissions by conserving kinetic energy. Since vehicles travel in platoons, the effectiveness of a GLOSA system is heavily reliant on correctly identifying the leading vehicle that is the first to be given trajectory advice for each cycle. Vehicles naturally form a platoon behind this leading vehicle. A time loop technique is proposed which allows accurate identification of the leader even when there are complex interactions between preceding vehicles. The developed algorithms are ideal for connected autonomous vehicle environments, because computer control allows vehicles' trajectories to be managed with greater accuracy and ease. However, the advice algorithms can also be used in conjunction with manual control provided Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication is available. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB End-to-end autonomous driving provides a simple and efficient framework for autonomous driving systems, which can directly obtain control commands from raw perception data. However, it fails to address stability and interpretability problems in complex urban scenarios. In this paper, we construct a two-stage end-to-end autonomous driving model for complex urban scenarios, named HIIL (Hierarchical Interpretable Imitation Learning), which integrates interpretable BEV mask and steering angle to solve the problems shown above. In Stage One, we propose a pretrained Bird's Eye View (BEV) model which leverages a BEV mask to present an interpretation of the surrounding environment. In Stage Two, we construct an Interpretable Imitation Learning (IIL) model that fuses BEV latent feature from Stage One with an additional steering angle from Pure-Pursuit (PP) algorithm. In the HIIL model, visual information is converted to semantic images by the semantic segmentation network, and the semantic images are encoded to extract the BEV latent feature, which are decoded to predict BEV masks and fed to the IIL as perception data. In this way, the BEV latent feature bridges the BEV and IIL models. Visual information can be supplemented by the calculated steering angle for PP algorithm, speed vector, and location information, thus it could have better performance in complex and terrible scenarios. Our HIIL model meets an urgent requirement for interpretability and robustness of autonomous driving. We validate the proposed model in the CARLA simulator with extensive experiments which show remarkable interpretability, generalization, and robustness capability in unknown scenarios for navigation tasks.

AB Making autonomous driving a safe, feasible, and better alternative is one of the core problems the world is facing today. The horizon of the applications of AI and deep learning has changed the perspective of the human mind. Initially, what used to be thought of as the subtle impossible task is applicable today, and that too in the feasibly efficient way. Computer vision tasks powered with highly tuned CNNs are outperforming humans in many fields. Introductory implementations of the autonomous vehicle were merely achieved using raw image processing, and hard programmed rule-based logic systems along with machine/deep learning were used as secondary objective handlers. With the autonomous driving method proposed by Nvidia, the usability of CNNs is more adequate, adaptable, and applicable. In this paper, we propose the ensemble implementation of CNN-based regression models for autonomous driving. We have taken simulator generated driving view image dataset along with a mapped file of steering angle in radians. After applying image pre-processing and augmentation, we have used two CNN models along with their ensemble and compared their performance to minimize the risks of unsafe driving. We have compared Nvidia proposed CNN, MobileNet-V2 as regression model and Ensemble-M results for comparison of their respective performance, MSE scores and compute time to process. In result analysis, the MobileNet-V2 model performs better in densely featured roads and the Nvidia model performs better in sparsely featured roads, whereas Ensemble-M normalizes the performance of both models and efficiently results in the least MSE score (0.0201) with the highest computation time utilization making autonomous driving better, safer alternative.

AB An autonomous underwater robot named ''Twin-Burger'' was developed as a versatile test bed to establish the techniques which realize intelligent robot behaviors. The robot was designed to have necessary functions for complex tasks including cooperative task execution with other robots and divers. The first robot ''Twin-Burger I'' was completed and launched in November 1992. This paper describes hardware and software systems of the robot. Motion of the robot is controlled by sliding controllers based on simplified equations of motion which are derived from system identification experiments. Tank tests proved that the robot was able to cruise along a commanded path as a sequence of control actions generated by the sliding controllers. The Distributed Vehicle Management Architecture (DVMA) is applied to the robot as an architecture for the control software. Mission execution experiments shows that the Twin-Burger behaves appropriately according to the mission and environmental conditions.

AB This study aims to develop a spatiotemporal traffic density estimation method based on the advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) Probe data. This study uses the vehicle trajectory data collected from the ADAS equipped on the sample probe vehicles. Such vehicle trajectory data are used firstly to estimate the distance headway between the vehicles on a specific road section, and the postprocessed distance headway data are finally used to estimate the spatiotemporal traffic density. The innovation aspect of the proposed methodology in this study is that traffic density can be estimated in high accuracy only with a small size of data points in support of ADAS. On the other hand, existing density estimation method requires a large number of probe vehicles and its numerous data sets including either the global positioning system data or the dedicated short-range communication data. To verify the proposed methodology, a two-step evaluation is performed: the first step is a numerical evaluation that estimates the spatiotemporal traffic density based on the simulated vehicle trajectory data, and the second step is an empirical evaluation that estimates the density based on the real-road data in both peak and nonpeak periods. Beyond the methodology development, this study verified the estimation reliability of traffic density under various traffic conditions based on the sampling rate of ADAS-equipped vehicles. Consequently, the traffic density estimation error decreased as the sampling rate increased. Estimation accuracy of 90% or higher was observed in all scenarios when the sampling rate was 50% or higher. It indicates that fairly accurate traffic density estimation is feasible using probe vehicles that correspond to half of the vehicles driven on the road. Therefore, this practical approach is expected to mitigate the burden of density estimation, particularly in future road systems in which ADAS and autonomous vehicles are prevalent.

AB An innovative electro-optical navigation system called Optical Navigation System (OptoNav) for Autonomous Landing consisting of a machine vision camera, and a set of co-registered structured light beacons is proposed. OptoNav is used to directly sense the altitude and two orientation states of an air vehicle with respect to the flight path direction. Motivated by autonomous landing applications involving fixed-wing aircraft, the machine vision camera is used to process the images of the runway so as to establish a moving coordinate system affixed to the runway, making use of the perspective geometry of the camera system. Three or more structured light emitters are used to make direct measurements of the range using the geometry of the perspective projection model by making use of the co-registration of the camera with respect to the structured light emitting sources. A unique formulation of the minimal relative motion states is used to directly estimate the three states of altitude, pitch and roll angle of the airframe with respect to the moving coordinates affixed to the runway. Laboratory experiments are used to validate the utility of the OptoNav sensor system.

AB Cooperative perception has been widely used in autonomous driving to alleviate the inherent limitation of single automated vehicle perception. To enable cooperation, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication plays an indispensable role. This letter analyzes the performance of cooperative perception accounting for communications channel impairments. Different fusion methods and channel impairments are evaluated. A new late fusion scheme is proposed to leverage the robustness of intermediate features. In order to compress the data size incurred by cooperation, a convolution neural network-based autoencoder is adopted. Numerical results demonstrate that intermediate fusion is more robust to channel impairments than early fusion and late fusion, when the SNR is greater than 0 dB. Also, the proposed fusion scheme outperforms the conventional late fusion using detection outputs, and autoencoder provides a good compromise between detection accuracy and bandwidth usage.

AB This paper investigates the cooperative trajectory planning for multiple unmanned combat aerial vehicles in performing autonomous cooperative air-to-ground target attack missions. Firstly, the collision-free cooperative trajectory planning problem for time-critical missions is formulated as a cooperative trajectory optimal control problem (CTP-OCP), which is based on an approximate allowable attack region model, several constraints model, and a multi-criteria objective function. Next, a planning algorithm based on the differential flatness, B-spline curves and nonlinear programming is designed to solve the CTP-OCP. In particular, the notion of the virtual time is introduced to deal with the temporal constraints. Finally, the proposed approach is validated by two typical scenarios and the simulation results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed planning approach.

AB Due to the absence of a human driver, the introduction of fully automated vehicles (FAVs) may bring new safety challenges to the traffic system, especially when FAVs interact with vulnerable road users such as pedestrians. To ensure safer interactions between pedestrians and FAVs, this questionnaire-based study aims to understand Australian pedestrians' intention to engage in risky road-crossing behaviors when they interact with FAVs vs. human-driven vehicles (HDVs). A 2 x 2 between-subject design was utilized, in which two risky road-crossing scenarios were designed and took into account the vehicle type (FAV vs. HDV) and vehicle speed (30 km/h vs. 50 km/h). A total of 493 participants (aged 18-77) were randomly assigned to one of the four experimental conditions and completed an online questionnaire based on the extended Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). This questionnaire measured pedestrians' intentions to cross the road in the assigned scenarios as well as the motivational factors behind these intentions in terms of attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, perceived risk and trust in the vehicle. The results show that pedestrians had significantly higher intentions to cross the road in front of approaching FAVs than HDVs. Participants also reported a lower risk perception of crossing in front of FAVs and greater trust in this type of vehicle. Attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control were significant predictors of intentions to engage in risky road-crossing behavior. Findings of this study provide important implications for the development and implementation of FAVs in the future road transport system.

AB This paper presents a traversability assessment method and a trajectory planning method. They are key features for the navigation of an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) in a non-planar environment. In this work, a 3D light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor is used to obtain the geometric information about a rough terrain surface. For a given SE(2) pose of the vehicle and a specific vehicle model, the SE(3) pose of the vehicle is estimated based on LiDAR points, and then a traversability is computed. The traversability tells the vehicle the effects of its interaction with the rough terrain. Note that the traversability is computed on demand during trajectory planning, so there is not any explicit terrain discretization. The proposed trajectory planner finds an initial path through the non-holonomic A*, which is a modified form of the conventional A* planner. A path is a sequence of poses without timestamps. Then, the initial path is optimized in terms of the traversability, using the method of Lagrange multipliers. The optimization accounts for the model of the vehicle's suspension system. Therefore, the optimized trajectory is dynamically feasible, and the trajectory tracking error is small. The proposed methods were tested in both the simulation and the real-world experiments. The simulation experiments were conducted in a simulator called Gazebo, which uses a physics engine to compute the vehicle motion. The experiments were conducted in various non-planar experiments. The results indicate that the proposed methods could accurately estimate the SE(3) pose of the vehicle. Besides, the trajectory cost of the proposed planner was lower than the trajectory costs of other state-of-the-art trajectory planners.

AB This article presents an adaptive method for ArduPilot-based autopilots of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). ArduPilot is a popular open-source unmanned vehicle software suite. We explore how to augment the PID loops embedded inside ArduPilot with a model-free adaptive control method. The adaptive augmentation, adopted for both attitude and total energy control, uses input/output data without requiring an explicit model of the UAV. The augmented architecture is tested in a software-in-the-loop UAV platform in the presence of several uncertainties (unmodeled low-level dynamics, different payloads, time-varying wind, and changing mass). The performance is measured in terms of tracking errors and control efforts of the attitude and total energy control loops. Extensive experiments with the original ArduPilot, the proposed augmentation, and alternative autopilot strategies show that the augmentation can significantly improve the performance for all payloads and wind conditions: the UAV is less affected by wind and exhibits more than 70% improved tracking, with more than 7% reduced control effort.

AB This paper presents a lateral and longitudinal coupling controller for a trajectory-tracking control system. The proposed controller can simultaneously minimize lateral tracking deviation while tracking the desired trajectory and vehicle speed. Firstly, we propose a hierarchical control structure composed of upper and lower-level controllers. In the upper-level controller, the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller is designed to compute the desired front wheel steering angle for minimizing the lateral tracking deviation, and the model-predictive controller is developed to compute the desired acceleration for maintaining the planed vehicle speed. The lower-level controller enables the achievement of the desired steering angle and acceleration via the corresponding component devices. Furthermore, an observer based on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is proposed to update the vehicle driving states, which are sensitive to the trajectory-tracking control and difficult to measure directly using the existing vehicle sensors. Finally, the Co-simulation (CarSim-MATLAB/Simulink) results demonstrate that the proposed coupling controller is able to robustly realize the trajectory tracking control and can effectively reduce the lateral tracking error.

AB With the rapid development of information and communication technology, future intelligent transportation systems will exhibit a trend of cooperative driving of connected vehicles. Platooning is an important application technique for cooperative driving. Herein, optimized car-following models for platoon control based on intervehicle communication technology are proposed. On the basis of existing indicators, a series of evaluation methods for platoon safety, stability, and energy consumption is constructed. Numerical simulations are used to compare the effects of three traditional models and their optimized counterparts on the car-following process. Moreover, the influence of homogenous and heterogeneous attributes on the platoon is analyzed. The optimized model proposed in this paper can improve the stability and safety of vehicle following and reduce the total fuel consumption. The simulation results show that a homogenous platoon can enhance the overall stability of the platoon and that the desired safety margin (DSM) model is better suited for heterogeneous platoon control than the other two models. This paper provides a practical method for the design and systematic evaluation of a platoon control strategy, which is one of the key focuses in the connected and autonomous vehicle industry.

AB The gradual deployment of automated vehicles on the existing road network will lead to a long transition period in which vehicles at different driving automation levels and capabilities will share the road with human driven vehicles, resulting into what is known as mixed traffic. Whether our road infrastructure is ready to safely and efficiently accommodate this mixed traffic remains a knowledge gap. Microscopic traffic simulation provides a proactive approach for assessing these implications. However, differences in assumptions regarding modeling automated driving in current simulation studies, and the use of different terminology make it difficult to compare the results of these studies. Therefore, the aim of this study is to specify the aspects to consider for modeling automated driving in microscopic traffic simulations using harmonized concepts, to investigate how both empirical studies and microscopic traffic simulation studies on automated driving have considered the proposed aspects, and to identify the state of the practice and the research needs to further improve the modeling of automated driving. Six important aspects were identified: the role of authorities, the role of users, the vehicle system, the perception of surroundings based on the vehicle's sensors, the vehicle connectivity features, and the role of the infrastructure both physical and digital. The research gaps and research directions in relation to these aspects are identified and proposed, these might bring great benefits for the development of more accurate and realistic modeling of automated driving in microscopic traffic simulations.

AB This paper presents a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) which models a driver's binary decision to or not to execute a discretionary lane changing move on freeways. It answers the following question "Is it time to begin to move into the target lane?" after the driver has decided to change lane and have selected the target lane. The system uses four input variables: the gap between the subject vehicle and the preceding vehicle in the original lane, the gap between the subject vehicle and the preceding vehicle in the target lane, the gap between the subject vehicle and the following vehicle in the target lane, and the distance between the preceding and following vehicles in the target lanes. The input variables were selected based on the outcomes of a drivers survey, and can be measured by sensors instrumented in the subject vehicle. The FIS was trained with Next Generation SIMulation (NGSIM) vehicle trajectory data collected at the I-80 Freeway in Emeryville, California, and then tested with data collected at the U.S. Highway 101 in Los Angeles, California. The results of the test have shown that the system made lane change recommendations of "yes, change lane" with 82.2% accuracy, and "no, do not change lane" with 99.5% accuracy. These accuracies are better than the same performance measures given by the TRANSMODELER's gap acceptance model for discretionary lane change on freeways, which is also calibrated with NGSIM data. The developed FIS has a potential to be implemented in lane change advisory systems, in autonomous vehicles, as well as microscopic traffic simulation tools. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

ID BEHAVIORS
AB Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV) have been rapidly developed, which, inevitably, renders that human-driven and autonomous vehicles share the road. Thus, trajectory prediction is an important research topic, which helps each CAV to efficiently follow a Human-Driven Vehicle (HV). In a wider scope, trajectory prediction, also, helps to improve the throughput of traffic flow and enhance its stability. To realize the trajectory prediction of Connected and Automated Vehicles to Human-Driven Vehicles, a car-following model, which is based on trajectory data, was established. Adding deep neural networks and an Attention mechanism, this paper established a data-driven car-following model, based on CNN-BiLSTM-Attention for CAV, to predict trajectory, by referring to the modeling idea of the traditional car-following model. The trajectory data in the next-generation-simulation (NGSIM) datasets that match the car-following characteristics were selected. In addition, noise-reduction pre-processing of the trajectory data was performed, to make it match the actual car-following situation. Experiments, for selecting the optimal structure of the model and the method of trajectory prediction, were carried out. The data-driven car-following models, such as LSTM, GRU, and CNN-BiLSTM, were selected for comparative analysis of trajectory prediction. The results show that the CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model has the smallest MAE and MSE as well as the largest R-2. The CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model has the highest accuracy in vehicle-trajectory prediction. The model can, effectively, realize vehicle-trajectory prediction and provide a theoretical basis for vehicle-trajectory-based velocity guidance of Human-Driven Vehicles. In the future, the model can, also, provide the theoretical basis for Connected and Automated Vehicles, to make car-following decisions in mixed traffic flow.

AB Path planning is a critical part for improving the driving safety and driver comfort of autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially in complex maneuvering conditions. In addition, different drivers have different preferences for AVs, thus, how to provide personalized trajectories for different drivers is a vital issue for AVs. The collision-free path planning problem in conditions with large road curvatures is investigated in this paper, with the consideration of environmental safety constraints, drivers' comfort, vehicle actuator constraints, etc. Firstly, a Driver-Vehicle-Road (DVR) system is established based on the combination of the kinematic vehicle model and the two-point visual preview driver model, such that the driver's individual handling characteristics can be considered in the controller. The kinematic vehicle model is modified to have the similar understeering characteristics with those of the nonlinear full car models, and then the proposed DVR system can satisfy different groups of drivers and cars. Secondly, for environmental constraints, a new artificial potential field (APF) method is proposed, which can form a banana-shaped 3-D dangerous imaginary mountain and a lane boundary cliff suitable for arbitrary curvature roads to generate a collision-free evasive path. Finally, the Linear-Time-Varying (LTV) model predictive control (MPC) method is adopted to design the path planner. The CarSim-Simulink joint simulation illustrates that with the proposed planner, the host vehicle is capable of avoiding obstacles with a safer and more comfortable maneuver on large curvature roads. And the proposed path planner can provide individually safe trajectories for different drivers with good maneuverability.

AB With the aim of realizing energy-efficient, personalized, and safe mobility, a novel lane-changing motion plan-ning strategy for personalized energy-efficient autonomous driving is proposed in this research. The key tech-nologies consist of trajectory planning and trajectory tracking. Taking the quintic polynomials as the general trajectory cluster generator, the overall trajectory planning is converted into a constrained optimization problem using the lane-changing duration. The feasible and safe lane-changing trajectories can be extracted from the general trajectory cluster by introducing a stable handling envelope and a safe lane-changing area considering the constraints of vehicle dynamics limitation and surrounding traffic vehicles. A driving style identification module is developed based on multi-class Gaussian process classification utilizing real driving data to determine the trajectories that can characterize personalized features. Reflecting the constraints of feasibility, safety, and personalization on the boundaries of lane-changing duration, an energy-optimal lane-changing trajectory rep-resenting a specific driving style can be found and regarded as a reference. To precisely and rapidly control the vehicle to track the reference trajectory, a real-time nonlinear model predictive controller is designed and solved utilizing the parallel method. The algorithms proposed above are integrated and Driver-in-the-Loop experimental verifications are conducted. Experiment results demonstrated that the proposed strategy is able to realize lane change with an energy saving rate of 2.87% to 5.73% compared with human drivers' maneuver. Comparative simulation with a typical automatic lane-change model also shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which is capable of not only accomplishing the energy-efficient lane change but also satisfying human driver's personalized driving preferences.

ID AVOIDANCE
AB For a sustainable operation of multiple Self-Guided Vehicles (SGVs) in a dynamic manufacturing environment, it is essential to guarantee collision-free and efficient navigation to the autonomous mobile platforms and safety to the surrounding subjects. To prevent from navigation failures, an SGV must avoid conflicts that constrain itself to abruptly brake or stop to avoid collisions. These inefficient conflicts result from unexpected changes in the configuration space or due to nearby unforeseen obstacle. In this paper, a navigation approach is proposed to adapt the global trajectory in order to reduce conflict occurrence while limiting energy consumption of the mobile platform. To generate such trajectory, first the collision risks are characterized using an objective risk perception parameter, the Time-To-Collision TTC, that rely on the kinematics of the egoSGV and the neighboring obstacles. Next, weighted Kernel Density Estimation (wKDE) defines the spatial distribution of conflict severity in configuration space. The defined zones are incorporated as a conflict layer in the global map. Then, a global trajectory planner algorithm is used to weigh between the length cost and conflict cost. Finally, to test the proposed solution, a simulation is performed in a factory-like environment, then an experiment is conducted with a real SGV. In comparison with the state-of-the-art geometrical path planning method, the results show that the proposed approach reduces navigation failures by up to 52%, while reducing the trajectory execution time by around up to 10 %. Also, the smoothness of the executed motion allowed to reduce energy consumption by over 12%.

ID OPTIMIZATION APPROACH
AB The perception system has become a topic of great importance for autonomous vehicles, as high accuracy and real-time performance can ensure safety in complex urban scenarios. Clustering is a fundamental step for parsing point cloud due to the extensive input data (over 100,000 points) of a wide variety of complex objects. It is still challenging to achieve high precision real-time performance with limited vehicle-mounted computing resources, which need to balance the accuracy and processing time. We propose a method based on a Two-Layer-Graph (TLG) structure, which can be applied in a real autonomous vehicle under urban scenarios. TLG can describe the point clouds hierarchically, we use a range graph to represent point clouds and a set graph for point cloud sets, which reduce both processing time and memory consumption. In the range graph, Euclidean distance and the angle of the sensor position with two adjacent vectors (calculated from continuing points to different direction) are used as the segmentation standard, which use the local concave features to distinguish different objects close to each other. In the set graph, we use the start and end position to express the whole set of continuous points concisely, and an improved Breadth-First-Search (BFS) algorithm is designed to update categories of point cloud sets between different channels. This method is evaluated on real vehicles and major datasets. The results show that TLG succeeds in providing a real-time performance (less than 20 ms per frame), and a high segmentation accuracy rate (93.64%) for traffic objects in the road of urban scenarios.

ID OUTPUT-FEEDBACK CONTROL
AB This paper investigates trajectory tracking problem for a class of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with unknown dynamics and constrained inputs. Different from existing policy gradient methods which employ single actor critic but cannot realize satisfactory tracking control accuracy and stable learning, our proposed algorithm can achieve high-level tracking control accuracy of AUVs and stable learning by applying a hybrid actors-critics architecture, where multiple actors and critics are trained to learn a deterministic policy and action-value function, respectively. Specifically, for the critics, the expected absolute Bellman error-based updating rule is used to choose the worst critic to be updated in each time step. Subsequently, to calculate the loss function with more accurate target value for the chosen critic, Pseudo Q-learning, which uses subgreedy policy to replace the greedy policy in Q-learning, is developed for continuous action spaces, and Multi Pseudo Q-learning (MPQ) is proposed to reduce the overestimation of action-value function and to stabilize the learning. As for the actors, deterministic policy gradient is applied to update the weights, and the final learned policy is defined as the average of all actors to avoid large but bad updates. Moreover, the stability analysis of the learning is given qualitatively. The effectiveness and generality of the proposed MPQ-based deterministic policy gradient (MPQ-DPG) algorithm are verified by the application on AUV with two different reference trajectories. In addition, the results demonstrate high-level tracking control accuracy and stable learning of MPQ-DPG. Besides, the results also validate that increasing the number of the actors and critics will further improve the performance.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Object detection plays a vital role in autonomous driving systems, and the accurate detection of surrounding objects can ensure the safe driving of vehicles. This paper proposes a category-assisted transformer object detector called DetectFormer for autonomous driving. The proposed object detector can achieve better accuracy compared with the baseline. Specifically, ClassDecoder is assisted by proposal categories and global information from the Global Extract Encoder (GEE) to improve the category sensitivity and detection performance. This fits the distribution of object categories in specific scene backgrounds and the connection between objects and the image context. Data augmentation is used to improve robustness and attention mechanism added in backbone network to extract channel-wise spatial features and direction information. The results obtained by benchmark experiment reveal that the proposed method can achieve higher real-time detection performance in traffic scenes compared with RetinaNet and FCOS. The proposed method achieved a detection performance of 97.6% and 91.4% in AP50 and AP75 on the BCTSDB dataset, respectively.

AB This paper proposes a novel learning-based framework to realize quadrotor autonomous obstacle avoidance with monocular vision. The framework adopts a two-stage architecture, consisting of a sensing module and a decision module. The sensing module trained in an unsupervised manner can extract depth information from the on-board camera image. Moreover, the decision module uses dueling double deep recurrent Q-learning to eliminate the adverse effects of the on-board monocular camera's limited observation capacity while choosing practical obstacle avoidance action. The framework has two advantages: (1) it enables the quadrotor to realize autonomous obstacle avoidance without any prior environment information or labeled datasets for training, and (2) its model can be easily updated while facing new application scenarios. The experiments in several different simulation scenes show that the trained framework outperforms a high passing rate in crowded environments and a good generalization ability for transformed scenarios.

SO ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION
LA English
DT Article
AB Haptic shared control is used to manage the control authority allocation between a human and an autonomous agent in semi-autonomous driving. Existing haptic shared control schemes, however, do not take full consideration of the human agent. To fill this research gap, this study presents a haptic shared control scheme that adapts to a human operator's workload, eyes on road and input torque in real time. We conducted human-in-the-loop experiments with 24 participants. In the experiment, a human operator and an autonomy module for navigation shared the control of a simulated notional High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) at a fixed speed. At the same time, the human operator performed a target detection task. The autonomy could be either adaptive or non-adaptive to the above-mentioned human factors. Results indicate that the adaptive haptic control scheme resulted in significantly lower workload, higher trust in autonomy, better driving task performance and smaller control effort.

AB This paper describes the design and testing of an autonomous omnidirectional robot to be used for moving radioactive materials while minimizing human exposure. The robot, called the OmniMaxbot, uses the Robot Operating System (ROS) to allow the individual components to communicate as well as to control the movement. Details about the hardware and software used in the OmniMaxbot are explained. Test results are presented for the navigation system based on the ROS packages: Global Planner, Base Local Planner, and Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL). The test results confirm that the OmniMaxbot is capable of autonomously navigating to a mock ash can, lifting it, navigating to a drop-off location, putting the mock ash can down, backing away until the forks are clear of the mock ash can, and navigating to a standby location. These actions can be performed in areas with both static and dynamic obstacles.

AB This paper considers the control of a group of autonomous mobile robots. A coordinated control scheme based on a leader-follower approach is developed to achieve formation maneuvers. First and second order sliding-mode controllers are proposed for asymptotically stabilizing the vehicles to a time-varying desired formation.. The latter controller, based on the relative motion states, eliminates the need for measurement or estimation of the leader velocity. It enables formation stabilization using a vision system carried by the followers and ensures the collision avoidance from the initial time instance. Experimental investigation has been conducted using a test bench made of three nonholonomic mobile robots in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

AB Mobuliform swimmers are inspiring novel approaches to the design of underwater vehicles. These swimmers, exemplified by manta rays, present a model for new classes of efficient, highly maneuverable, autonomous undersea vehicles. To improve our understanding of the unsteady propulsion mechanisms used by these swimmers, we report detailed studies of the performance of robotic swimmers that mimic aspects of the animal propulsive mechanisms. We highlight the importance of the undulatory aspect of producing efficient manta ray propulsion and show that there is a strong interaction between the propulsive performance and the flexibility of the actuating surfaces.

The proposed scheme combines image moments descriptor and Event-Triggered (ET) Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) for efficient and accurate tracking. The deformable contour model allows adaptation to the evolving target's shape, while the proposed event-triggered scheme achieves improved computational efficiency and extended flight duration while generating new control sequences for the UAV. Real-world experimental validation as well as a comparative simulation performance analysis validate the scheme, showcasing its robustness in handling complex scenarios. This approach holds promise for various applications, such as surveillance and autonomous navigation.

AB Driver Systems for autonomous vehicles are the nucleus of many studies done so far. In this light, they mainly consist of two major parts: the recognition of the environment (usually based on image processing) as well as any learning aspects for the driving behaviour. The latter is the nucleus of this research whereby learning aspects are understood that way that the driving behaviour should be optimised over time, therefore the most appropriate actions for each possible situation should be self-created and lastly offered for selection. The current research bases the learning aspects on means of Reinforcement Learning which is in sharp contrast to other research studies done before being mainly based on explicit modelling or neural nets.

AB Location awareness is crucial for underwater applications; without it, gathered data would be essentially useless. However, it is impossible to directly determine the location of an underwater target because GPS-reliant methods cannot be utilized in the underwater environment. To this end, the underwater target localization technique has become one of the most critical technologies in underwater applications, wherein GPS-equipped autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) are typically used to assist with localization. It has been proved that, under the assumption of Gaussian noise, an appropriate geometry among ASVs and the underwater target can enhance localization accuracy. Unfortunately, the conclusion may not hold if outliers arise and the closed-form expression of Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) cannot be established. Eventually, it becomes hard to derive the accepted geometry, particularly for the received signal strength (RSS)-based ranging scenario. Therefore, this work optimizes the trajectory of ASVs with RSS-based ranging and in the presence of outliers to optimally estimate the location of an underwater target. The D-optimality criterion is applied in conjunction with the Monte Carlo method to determine the closed-form expression of the function, which then transforms the problem into an optimized framework. Nevertheless, the framework cannot be solved in the absence of the target location. In this case, the paper presents two methodologies to overcome the issue and achieve the optimum configuration without identifying the target location. (1) A min-max strategy that assumes that the target location drops in an uncertain region for a single or two ASVs is proposed; and (2) a two-phase localization approach (TPLA) that calculates the target location at each time slot for three ASVs is developed. Finally, the optimal trajectories of ASVs are constructed by a series of waypoints based on an analytically tractable measurement model in various conditions.

AB In this paper, the feed-forward control effect is introduced into the car-following system, which combines the proportional differentiation and velocity feedback effect to form a new compound compensation method to improve the stability and rapidity of the traffic flow system. The unit step input response in time domain analysis method is used to analyze the system and the feed-forward effect of the system. Using the small gain theorem and the Rouse criterion, we obtain the stability conditions of the improved system and obtain the neutral stability curves. Next, setting up simulation experiments discuss the influence of feed-forward effect on autonomous traffic flow system. The results show that the introduction of feed-forward effect can effectively improve the rapidity of traffic flow system responding to disturbances. Combined with appropriate proportional differentiation and velocity feedback, the system can be both stability and rapidity, which is meaningful for autonomous driving. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB Autonomous driving relies on trusty visual recognition of surrounding objects. Few-shot image classification is used in autonomous driving to help recognize objects that are rarely seen. Successful embedding and metric-learning approaches to this task normally learn a feature comparison framework between an unseen image and the labeled images. However, these approaches usually have problems with ambiguous feature embedding because they tend to ignore important local visual and semantic information when extracting intra-class common features from the images. In this paper, we introduce a Semantic-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism to refine feature embedding and it can be applied to most of the existing embedding and metric-learning approaches. The mechanism highlights pivotal local visual information with attention mechanism and aligns the attentive map with semantic information to refine the extracted features. Incorporating the proposed mechanism into the prototypical network, evaluation results reveal competitive improvements in both few-shot and zero-shot classification tasks on various benchmark datasets.

AB Connected vehicle environment provides the groundwork of future road transportation. Researches in this area are gaining a lot of attention to improve not only traffic mobility and safety, but also vehicles' fuel consumption and emissions. Energy optimization methods that combine traffic information are proposed, but actual testing in the field proves to be rather challenging largely due to safety and technical issues. In light of this, a Hardware in -the-Loop-System (HiLS) testbed to evaluate the performance of connected vehicle applications is proposed. A laboratory powertrain research platform, which consists of a real engine, an engine-loading device (hydrostatic dynamometer) and a virtual powertrain model to represent a vehicle, is connected remotely to a microscopic traffic simulator (VISSIM). Vehicle dynamics and road conditions of a target vehicle in the VISSIM simulation are transmitted to the powertrain research platform through the internet, where the power demand can then be calculated. The engine then operates through an engine optimization procedure to minimize fuel consumption, while the dynamometer tracks the desired engine load based on the target vehicle information. Test results show fast data transfer at every 200 ms and good tracking of the optimized engine operating points and the desired vehicle speed. Actual fuel and emissions measurements, which otherwise could not be calculated precisely by fuel and emission maps in simulations, are achieved by the testbed. In addition, VISSIM simulation can be implemented remotely while connected to the powertrain research platform through the internet, allowing easy access to the laboratory setup.

AB In this paper, vision-based autonomous flight with a quadrotor type unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is presented. Automatic detection of obstacles and junctions are achieved by the use of optical flow velocities. Variation in the optical flow is used to determine the reference yaw angle. Path to be followed is generated autonomously and the path following process is achieved via a PID controller operating as the low level control scheme. Proposed method is tested in the Google Earth (R) virtual environment for four different destination points. In each case. autonomous UAV flight is successfully simulated without observing collisions. The results show that the proposed method is a powerful candidate for vision based navigation in an urban environment. Claims are justified with a set of experiments and it is concluded that proper thresholding of the variance of the gradient of optical flow difference have a critical effect on the detectability of roads having different widths.

AB Aiming at the formation control problem for unmanned surface vehicles under input overload and external disturbance, a leader-follower formation control law based on input saturation and the adaptive super-twisting algorithm was designed in this paper. Firstly, the mathematical model of underactuated unmanned surface vehicle formation based on the leader-follower method is established, and the virtual expected velocity is designed by the back-stepping method to improve the control accuracy of formation. Secondly, the parametric uncertainties and unknown external disturbances in the USV's dynamical model are compensated by the proposed adaptive super-twisting control laws. In addition, the input saturation function is added to the controller to avoid machine necrosis caused by input overload. Finally, Simulation results show that the controller can roughly keep the trajectory of the USV consistent with the expected trajectory and ensure that the input values are within the safe range, which proves the effectiveness of the method in this paper.

DE vehicle control; model-matching; robust control; neural networks
AB In this paper, a novel neural network-based robust control method is presented for a vehicle-oriented problem, in which the main goal is to ensure stable motion of the vehicle under critical circumstances. The proposed method can be divided into two main steps. In the first step, the model matching algorithm is proposed, which can adjust the nonlinear dynamics of the controlled system to a nominal, linear model. The aim of model matching is to eliminate the effects of the nonlinearities and uncertainties of the system to increase the performances of the closed-loop system. The model matching process results in an additional control input, which is computed by a neural network during the operation of the control system. Furthermore, in the second step, a robust H & INFIN; is designed, which has double purposes: to handle the fitting error of the neural network and ensure the accurate tracking of the reference signal. The operation and efficiency of the proposed control algorithm are investigated through a complex test scenario, which is performed in the high-fidelity vehicle dynamics simulation software, CarMaker.

AB The rise of autonomous driving technology and the prosperity of mobile vehicular applications have brought tremendous pressure and put forward high bandwidth and low latency requirements for vehicular networks. Controller Area Network with Flexible Data-rate (CAN-FD) is a feasible choice to meet the high bandwidth and low latency requirements of in-vehicle communication of mobile vehicles. However, CAN-FD is vulnerable to masquerade attacks because it lacks necessary security authentication mechanisms and protection measures. This study presents a security enhancement technique called forward-backward exploration for independent in-vehicle CAN-FD messages while still guaranteeing each message is real-time. In the forward-backward exploration solution, a novel dual-pointer (including the forward pointer and the backward pointer) solution is proposed; the Message Authentication Code (MAC) size of each message is then dynamically adjusted by presenting the dual-pointer movement rules until the total payload no longer increases. Experimental results with real-life CAN-FD message set provided by an automaker demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution.

DE Path planning; Rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT); Obstacle avoidance
ID AVOIDANCE
AB The autonomous navigation of vehicles typically combines two kinds of methods: a path is first planned, and then the robot is driven by a local obstacle-avoidance controller. The present work, which focuses on path planning, proposes an extension to the well-known rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm to allow its integration with a trajectory parameter-space (TP-space) as an efficient method to detect collision-free, kinematically-feasible paths for arbitrarily-shaped vehicles. In contrast to original RRT, this proposal generates navigation trees, with poses as nodes, whose edges are all kinematically-feasible paths, suitable to being accurately followed by vehicles driven by pure reactive algorithms. Initial experiments demonstrate the suitability of the method with an Ackermann-steering vehicle model whose severe kinematic constraints cannot be obviated. An important result that sets this work apart from previous research is the finding that employing several families of potential trajectories to expand the tree, which can be done efficiently under the TP-space formalism, improves the optimality of the planned trajectories. A reference C++ implementation has been released as open-source.

ID MULTIROBOT LOCALIZATION
AB This paper presents a new method for distributed vision-aided cooperative localization and navigation for multiple inter-communicating autonomous vehicles based on three-view geometry constraints. Each vehicle is equipped with a standard inertial navigation system and an on-board camera only. In contrast to the traditional approach for cooperative localization, which is based on relative pose measurements, the proposed method formulates a measurement whenever the same scene is observed by different vehicles. Each such measurement is comprising of three images, which are not necessarily captured at the same time. The captured images, to which some navigation parameters are attached, are stored in repositories by some of the vehicles in the group. A graph-based approach is applied for calculating the correlation terms between the navigation parameters associated to images participating in the same measurement. The proposed method is examined using a statistical simulation and is further validated in an experiment that involved two vehicles in a holding pattern scenario. The experiments show that the cooperative three-view-based vision-aided navigation may considerably improve the performance of an inferior INS. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
LA English
DT Article
DE Vehicle detection; 3D vehicle reconstruction; Pose estimation;
   Multi-branch CNN; Active shape model
AB The 3D reconstruction of objects is a prerequisite for many highly relevant applications of computer vision such as mobile robotics or autonomous driving. To deal with the inverse problem of reconstructing 3D objects from their 2D projections, a common strategy is to incorporate prior object knowledge into the reconstruction approach by establishing a 3D model and aligning it to the 2D image plane. However, current approaches are limited due to inadequate shape priors and the insufficiency of the derived image observations for a reliable alignment with the 3D model. The goal of this paper is to show how 3D object reconstruction can profit from a more sophisticated shape prior and from a combined incorporation of different observation types inferred from the images. We introduce a subcategory-aware deformable vehicle model that makes use of a prediction of the vehicle type for a more appropriate regularisation of the vehicle shape. A multi-branch CNN is presented to derive predictions of the vehicle type and orientation. This information is also introduced as prior information for model fitting. Furthermore, the CNN extracts vehicle keypoints and wireframes, which are well-suited for model-to-image association and model fitting. The task of pose estimation and reconstruction is addressed by a versatile probabilistic model. Extensive experiments are conducted using two challenging real-world data sets on both of which the benefit of the developed shape prior can be shown. A comparison to state-of-the-art methods for vehicle pose estimation shows that the proposed approach performs on par or better, confirming the suitability of the developed shape prior and probabilistic model for vehicle reconstruction.

AB Recently, more and more research has been conducted to develop Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) applications that ensures the safety driving of CAVs under some extreme situations. This brief presents a robust control strategy for CAVs to preserve a precise tracking performance and maintain the stability of lateral dynamics when passing a sharp curve with uncertain road friction coefficient changes. In the proposed robust lateral dynamics control, robust optimization-based lateral dynamics controller is designed to achieve the stability of the lateral dynamics with the consideration of the road friction coefficient uncertainty. Simulation validations are carried out to evaluate the proposed control strategy. The results show that the robust optimization-based lateral dynamics can improve the robustness even with the uncertainty of the road friction coefficient.

AB Walkability and walking activity are of interest to planners, engineers, and health practitioners for their potential to improve safety, promote environmental and public health, and increase social equity. Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) will reshape the built environment, mobility, and safety in ways we cannot know with certainty-but which we may anticipate will change the meaning of "walkability." The CAV era may provide economic, environmental, and social benefits, while potentially disrupting the status quo. This paper considers the concept of walkability in light of the approaching transition to CAVs, considering literature in engineering, information technology, built environment, land use, and public health, to support a discussion on research needs. To add depth, we subject a collection of research papers and technical reports to text analytics.

AB The validity of any traffic simulation model depends on its ability to generate representative driver acceleration profiles. This paper studies the effectiveness of recurrent neural networks in predicting the acceleration distributions for car following on highways. The long short-term memory recurrent networks are trained and used to propagate the simulated vehicle trajectories over 10-s horizons. On the basis of several performance metrics, the recurrent networks are shown to generally match or outperform baseline methods in replicating driver behavior, including smoothness and oscillatory characteristics present in real trajectories. This paper reveals that the strong performance is due to the ability of the recurrent network to identify recent trends in the ego-vehicle's state, and recurrent networks are shown to perform as, well as feedforward networks with longer histories as inputs.

AB This paper overviews challenges in perception and decision making for intelligent, or highly automated, automotive vehicles. We illustrate our development of a complete perception and decision making system which addresses various challenges and propose an action planning method for highly automated vehicles which can merge into a roundabout. We use learning from demonstration to construct a classifier for high-level decision making, and develop a novel set of formulations that is suited to this challenging situation: multiple agents in a highly dynamic environment with interdependencies between agents, partial observability, and a limited amount of training data. Having limited amount of labeled training data is highly constraining, but a very real issue in real-world applications. We believe that our formulations are also well suited to other automated driving scenarios.

AB Object detection is an indispensable part of autonomous driving. It is the basis of other high-level applications. For example, autonomous vehicles need to use the object detection results to navigate and avoid obstacles. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale MobileNeck module and an algorithm to improve the performance of an object detection model by outputting a series of Gaussian parameters. These Gaussian parameters can be used to predict both the locations of detected objects and the localization confidences. Based on the above two methods, a new confidence-aware Mobile Detection (MobileDet) model is proposed. The MobileNeck module and loss function are easy to conduct and integrate with Generalized-IoU (GIoU) metrics with slight changes in the code. We test the proposed model on the KITTI and VOC datasets. The mean Average Precision (mAP) is improved by 3.8 on the KITTI dataset and 2.9 on the VOC dataset with less resource consumption.

AB This paper presents the consensus problem of general linear discrete time networked autonomous agents, using distributed model predictive control (DMPC) and event triggering algorithm. The computational complexity of conventional DMPC is high due to the large values of prediction horizon and control horizon required for real time systems. The increased computational load becomes an obstruction in the practical implementation of DMPC. To solve the issue, a novel design methodology of parameterizing the control input using discrete Laguerre functions is adopted in this paper. The predictive control protocol is applied to a group of networked autonomous agents operating on event triggered consensus algorithm. The proposed event triggered algorithm offers the advantages of lesser communication between the agents along with reduction in controller updates. The closed loop stability of the networked system is established using Lyapunov criterion, based on the terminal state's equality constraint. Comparison of the proposed algorithm with existing works through numerical examples shows significant reduction in computational load, design parameters and data transmission, while achieving comparable performance. To validate the theoretical results, simulation is carried out on a group of autonomous vehicles and the usefulness of the proposed algorithm on system performance is illustrated.

AB The increasing complexity of mathematical models developed as part of the recent advancements in autonomous mobility platforms has led to an escalation in uncertainty. Despite the intricate nature of such models, the detection, decision, and control methods for autonomous mobility path tracking remain critical. This study aims to achieve path tracking based on pixel-based control errors without parameters in the mathematical model. The proposed approach entails deriving control errors from a multi-particle filter based on a camera, estimating the error dynamics coefficients through a recursive least squares (RLS) approach, and using the sliding mode approach and weighted injection to formulate a cost function that leverages the estimated coefficients and control errors. The resultant adaptive steering control expedites the convergence of control errors towards zero by determining the magnitude of the injection variable based on the control errors and the finite-time convergence condition. The efficacy of the proposed approach is evaluated through an S-curved and elliptical path using autonomous mobility equipped with a single steering and driving module. The results demonstrate the capability of the approach to reasonably track target paths through driving and steering control facilitated by a multi-particle filter and a lidar-based obstacle detection system.

AB The regulatory endorsement of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the support of pivotal shipping market players in recent years motivate the investigation of the potential role that autonomous vessels play in the shipping industry. As the complexity and scale of the envisioned applications increase, research works gradually transform the focus from single-vessel systems to multi-vessel systems. Thus, autonomous multi-vessel systems applied in the shipping industry are becoming a promising research direction. One of the typical research directions is floating object manipulation by multiple tugboats. This paper offers a comprehensive literature review of the existing research on floating object manipulation by autonomous multi-vessel systems. Based on the prior knowledge of object manipulation problems in multi -robot systems, four typical ways of maritime object manipulation are summarized: attaching, caging, pushing, and towing. The advantages and disadvantages of each manipulation way are discussed, including its typical floating object and application scenarios. Moreover, the aspects of control objective, control architecture, collision avoidance operation, disturbances consideration, and role of each involved vessel are analyzed for gaining insight into the approaches for solving these problems. Finally, challenges and future directions are highlighted to give possible inspiration.

AB Extensive studies developed eco-driving strategies to smooth traffic and reduce energy consumption and emission at signalized intersections. Part I (Zhang and Du, 2022) of this study developed a novel platoon-centered control for eco-driving (PCC-eDriving), considering a mixed flow involving Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) and Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs). This PCC-eDriving is mathematically implemented by a hybrid Model Predictive Control (MPC) system and solved by an active-set based optimal condition decomposition algorithm (AS-OCD). It generates discrete control laws for a platoon to approach, split as sub-platoons as needed, and then pass the intersections smoothly and efficiently. Though the numerical experiments validated the effectiveness, the theoretical properties of the hybrid MPC system and the solution algorithms were not investigated. Part II of this study thus focused on these theoretical analyses. Mainly, we first analyzed and proved the MPC sequential feasibility and hybrid system switching feasibility to guarantee the control continuity of the hybrid MPC system. Next, we factored CAV control uncertainties and proved the Input-to-state stability of the robust MPC controller. These proofs theoretically ensured the effectiveness and robustness of the hybrid MPC system. Last, we proved the solution optimality and convergence of the AS-OCD algorithm. It confirmed that the AS-OCD algorithm could find the global optimal solutions for the MPC optimizers with a linear convergence rate.

TI Trajectory Planning in Frenet Frame via Multi-Objective Optimization

   planning; Frenet frame; convex optimization; cost function
AB Autonomous vehicles are an essential tool for promoting the development of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and can effectively reduce traffic accidents caused by human errors. As an important part of the automatic driving software system, path planning is responsible for generating the motion trajectory of the vehicle, which is the primary factor determining driving quality. However, solution space construction and optimization problem formulation remain challenging research areas in the field of path planning. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective optimization algorithm for static obstacle avoidance to improve the comfort, safety and anti-deviation of the planned trajectory. We decouple the lateral and longitudinal motion of the vehicle using the Frenet frame and discretize the driving state space to generate target states of the vehicle. Based on the initial and target states, we generate a set of lateral and longitudinal motion trajectories using quintic and quartic polynomials, respectively. In addition, we design a cost function that comprehensively considers the comfort, safety, and deviation distance of the road center line by combining an acceleration check, curvature check, and collision check. As part of the cost function, we propose a novel method to quantify the safety of candidate trajectories considering the size of obstacles. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can quantize the safety of candidate paths and improve comfort 13.47%, 32.19%, 59.36% and 18.60% on a straight road, curvy road, intersection and U-shaped road, respectively. Furthermore, the algorithm can improve anti-deviation by 63.72%, 13.86%, 44.36%, and 45.56% on a straight road, curvy road, intersection and U-shaped road, respectively.

AB Most studies of autonomous vehicle (AV) acceptance have focused on its acceptance by the general population. There is a dearth of knowledge among users with different abilities and needs. Hence, this study addresses this gap by investigating user acceptance of shared AVs among people with different mobility and communication needs in Singapore. Understanding the perspectives of these users is critical to ensure that shared AVs services are inclusive, aiding in acceptance. The groups studied are the 1) blind and visually impaired; 2) deaf and hard of hearing; 3) individuals using mobility aids, such as wheelchair, scooter, or cane; 4) individuals with autism and their caregivers; 5) families with young children and pregnant women; 6) seniors (age 60 + ). Using an online survey (n = 300) and focus group discussions (n = 53), we found that these user groups are (i) anticipating AV in public transport with positive attitudes and emotions, and (ii) generally concerned about various aspects of safety. AV service safety and reliability are ranked as top concerns across all groups surveyed. Users who are likely to require onboard assistance prioritised ease of boarding and alighting, and all groups ranked the presence of 'onboard service staff' as less important. Participants identified several important service features, such as onboard safety features -especially a 'live' intercom, and auditory and visual cues for visually impaired and hard of hearing. Some users would also like dedicated lanes for AVs. Inclusive experiential rides on an AV will help members of these groups feel more comfortable and prepared for AVs once deployed.

AB Highly automated vehicles (HAVs) generate the optimistic prospect of future smart mobility together with the disruptive influence of traditional policies. Formulating appropriate policies based on applicable methods are necessary to cope with the potential uncertainties of HAVs. By reviewing the literature in a structural manner, this paper analyzes the emerging importance and research frontiers in formulating HAV policies and presents insights gained from three major methods of dealing with uncertain, dynamic, and evolving transport problems. First, the formulation of HAV policy is important for at least three reasons: it may accelerate the development and control of potential uncertainties of HAV, balance technology innovations with traffic security, and provide a steady and efficient migration from human drivers to automated driving systems. Second, current research focuses mainly on the role of government, licensing and testing standards, certification, reliability, policy interventions, public health, legal challenges, and restrictive or supportive policies. A common research framework and methodology of HAV systems has not yet been established to deal with the uncertainties of technology security. Finally, three potential methods of formulating HAV policy are identified herein, namely (1) the backcasting method, which could determine the future of HAV objectives and pathways; (2) the dynamic adaptive method, which makes the policy transition to HAV systems more organic and dynamic; and (3) the policy transfer and migration method, which provides a clear vision of the adaptation procedure. These methods are used in different circumstances to formulate HAV policies. Each method has its pros and cons. The present review provides insights into formulating future HAV policies using these methods.

ID ATTACKS
AB Due to the vulnerability of in-vehicle networks, particularly the Controller Area Network (CAN), malicious remote intrusion into vehicles has been a prominent public concern in recent years. The majority of existing technologies disregard the importance of the frame payload, making it difficult to detect tampered frames. In this paper, we propose Bit Scanner, a whitelist-based anomaly detection method that employs fine-grained checking for frame payload. Bit Scanner has no dependency on the CAN periodicity or CAN protocol. Its detection capabilities are evaluated using genuine CAN traffic collected from an autonomous bus. The results show that the proposed method has a malicious frames detection rate improvement of about 20% under replay attack scenarios, and a malicious packets detection rate improvement of at least 20% under tampering attack situations compared to the state-of-art methods.

AB This paper describes the modeling, control and hardware implementation of an experimental tilt-rotor aircraft. This vehicle combines the high-speed cruise capabilities of a conventional airplane with the hovering capabilities of a helicopter by tilting their four rotors. Changing between cruise and hover flight modes in mid-air is referred to transition. Dynamic model of the vehicle is derived both for vertical and horizontal flight modes using Newtonian approach. Two nonlinear control strategies are presented and evaluated at simulation level to control, the vertical and horizontal flight dynamics of the vehicle in the longitudinal plane. An experimental prototype named Quad-plane was developed to perform the vertical flight. A low-cost DSP-based Embedded Flight Control System (EFCS) was designed and built to achieve autonomous attitude-stabilized flight.

AB In this paper we propose a nonlinear control approach for the path-tracking of an autonomous underactuated airship. A backstepping controller is designed from the airship nonlinear dynamic model including wind disturbances, and further enhanced to consider actuators saturation. Control implementation issues related to airship underactuation are also addressed, namely control allocation and an attitude reference shaping to obtain a faster error correction with smoother input requests. The results obtained demonstrate the capacity of an underactuated unmanned airship to execute a realistic mission including vertical take-off and landing, stabilization and path-tracking, in the presence of wind disturbances, with a single robust control law.

AB This article presents and compares two neural network-based approaches to global self-localization (GSL) for autonomous mobile robots using: (1) a Kohonen neural network; and (2) a region-feature neural network (RFNN). Both approaches categorize discrete regions of space (topographical nodes) in a manner similar to optical character recognition (OCR). That is, the mapped sonar data assumes the form of a character unique to that region. Hence, it is believed that an autonomous vehicle can determine which room it is in from sensory data gathered from exploration. With a robust exploration routine, the GSL solution can be time-, translation-, and rotation-invariant. The GSL solution can also become independent of the mobile robot used to collect the sensor data. This suggests that a single robot can transfer its knowledge of various learned regions to other mobile robots. The classification rate of both approaches are comparable and, thus, worthy of presentation. The observed pros and cons of both approaches are also discussed. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB Within this paper a new path planning algorithm for autonomous robotic exploration and inspection is presented. The proposed method plans online in a receding horizon fashion by sampling possible future configurations in a geometric random tree. The choice of the objective function enables the planning for either the exploration of unknown volume or inspection of a given surface manifold in both known and unknown volume. Application to rotorcraft Micro Aerial Vehicles is presented, although planning for other types of robotic platforms is possible, even in the absence of a boundary value solver and subject to nonholonomic constraints. Furthermore, the method allows the integration of a wide variety of sensor models. The presented analysis of computational complexity and thorough simulations-based evaluation indicate good scaling properties with respect to the scenario complexity. Feasibility and practical applicability are demonstrated in real-life experimental test cases with full on-board computation.

AB Invasive aquatic plant species can expand rapidly throughout water bodies and cause severely adverse economic and ecological impacts. While mechanical, chemical, and biological methods exist for the identification and treatment of these invasive species, they are manually intensive, inefficient, costly, and can cause collateral ecological damage. To address current deficiencies in aquatic weed management, this paper details the development of a small fleet of fully autonomous boats capable of subsurface hydroacoustic imaging (to scan aquatic vegetation), machine learning (for automated weed identification), and herbicide deployment (for vegetation control). These capabilities aim to minimize manual labor and provide more efficient, safe (reduced chemical exposure to personnel), and timely weed management. Geotagged hydroacoustic imagery of three aquatic plant varieties (Hydrilla, Cabomba, and Coontail) was collected and used to create a software pipeline for subsurface aquatic weed classification and distribution mapping. Employing deep learning, the novel software achieved a classification accuracy of 99.06% after training.

AB Individuals with a spinal cord injury (SCI) have challenges using transportation. Autonomous shuttles (ASs), if accessible, may support their transportation needs. This study quantified the perceptions of AS for adults with and without SCI, before and after riding in the AS. We hypothesized that the perceptions of AS for individuals with SCI would improve, by the greatest magnitude, after riding in the AS. This mixed-method quasi-experimental design included 16 adults with SCI and 16 age-matched controls. While there were no differences between the groups, both groups reported having fewer perceived barriers to using AS after riding in the AS (p = .025). After riding in the AS, both groups stated that the AS must be available, accessible, and affordable if they are to use AS. In conclusion, adults with SCI should experience AS if they are to accept and adopt this mode of transportation.

AB NEREUS is a self-contained underwater membrane-inlet mass spectrometer (MS) based on a cycloidal mass analyzer. Designed for autonomous operation, with a mass of 22 kg and a power consumption of less than 20 W, a NEREUS prototype was demonstrated in freshwater and marine environments to a depth of 25 m. The instrument was operated in both tethered and towed operation, as well as aboard Kemonaut, an Odyssey-class autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) modified to accommodate the NEREUS instrument. The Kemonaut AUV greatly expands the range of environments that can practicably be investigated. NEREUS was demonstrated to measure many important metabolic gases, such as oxygen, methane, and carbon dioxide, at levels encountered in natural waters; it also responds to light hydrocarbon pollutants. Important goals for future instruments are increased capability to self-calibrate in situ and lowered detection limits that enable measurement of trace metabolic gases, such as hydrogen and nitrous oxide.

The paper first describes the primary sources of uncertainty arising in UAV guidance and then describes relevant practical techniques that have been reported in the literature. The paper makes a point of distinguishing between contributions from the field of robotics and artificial intelligence, and the field of dynamical systems and controls. Mutual and individual contributions for these fields are highlighted providing a roadmap for tackling the UAV guidance problem.

AB The current study is motivated by the need to better understand the potential impacts that vehicular automation may have on individual decisions of residential and work relocation in a future autonomous vehicle (AV) scenario. The study employs a multivariate approach to model five behavioral dimensions simultaneously: (1) technology-savviness (TS) propensity, (2) interest in productive use of travel time (IPTT) propensity, (3) interest in work relocation, (4) interest in residential relocation, and (5) tolerance to an increase in commute travel time. Data from a webbased survey of commuters in 2017 in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metropolitan Area (DFW) is employed. The results show that both TS and IPTT, as well as demographic variables, impact relocation decisions when individuals have a private AV available for their commute. Importantly, there is considerable heterogeneity across individuals in the willingness to relocate and/or accept longer commute times in an AV future. As such, our model results may be used to inform inputs to land use and travel demand models in an AV future. Also, our results suggest that the magnitude of value of travel time savings (VTTS) decrease considered in many earlier AV impact simulation studies may be much higher than reality. Relative to 50% and even 100% VTTS decreases assumed in many studies, our results suggest a much more modest 30% or so overall decrease in VTTS because of the ability to commute in a privately-owned AV. Finally, our results do predict a rather substantial extent of urban sprawl due to AVs, potentially up to a 68% increase in the horizontal spread of cities such as Dallas-Fort Worth, unless proactive planning and policies are implemented to avert such consequences of AVs.

AB In this paper, a complete solution for autonomous landing of a low-cost quadrotor on a moving platform is presented. First, the dynamic model of the quadrotor is described and simplified for landing task. Second, a novel landing pad associated with detection algorithm is designed for robust detection by a low-cost monocular camera. In order to deal with mirror effect and occasional misidentification, a 3D point cluster algorithm for relative position estimation is proposed. Third, using the backstepping approach, an adaptive position controller is designed to calculate the desired attitude for attitude loop. The overall stability of the position loop is proven by a Lyapunov method. Meanwhile, some landing strategies are presented to achieve a safe and stable landing task. Finally, the low-cost system architecture of the quadrotor and the experiment results are both demonstrated to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study adopted an integrated simulation approach for generating more realistic vehicle trajectories, ultimately for enhancing the surrogate safety assessment methodology under the Connected Vehicle (CV) environment. This integrated simulation divides into two main parts, real time-based simulation approach and post-processing approach. The real-time simulation environment consists of the microscopic traffic simulator to generate various traffic situations, driver warning simulator, GPS/INU simulator, and V2V/V2I communication delays probability model. The post-processing approach includes vehicle dynamics model to incorporate vehicle dynamics to the vehicle trajectories and Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM) to identify traffic conflicts. This integrated simulation approach was adopted to assess the safety impact of Connected Vehicle (CV)-based traffic applications by considering potential positioning errors and communication delays which are likely to occur in reality. The evaluation results showed that the V2V/V2I communication delays degraded the effectiveness of driver warnings by 3-13% while the driver warnings under ideal conditions (i.e., error-free vehicle positions and no V2V/V2I communication delays) reduced conflicts by 27-42%. In addition, the most accurate GPS/INU device (i.e., Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS) was the best for use with vehicle safety applications as the RTK case was the closest to the ground truth-based warning scenario. Meanwhile, the device with the lowest accuracy (i.e., autonomous GPS) was not very suitable for deployment in the safety application as this case showed even worse results than the base case (i.e., no driver warnings). This integrated simulation approach used for these experiments is a practical and reliable alternative for assessing the safety impact of CV-based traffic applications since it considers the potential positioning errors and communication delays which are likely to affect the performance of CV-based traffic applications in reality and uses vehicle dynamics-incorporated vehicle trajectories which are more realistic than the sore traffic simulator vehicle trajectories.

AB This article proposes an unscented Kalman filter-based visual docking controller for underactuated underwater vehicles using a position-based visual servoing (PBVS) approach. The relative pose of an underwater vehicle with respect to a moving docking station is estimated by an unscented Kalman filter with the visual measurements of multiple point features installed on the station. Based on the estimated pose, the Euler angles commands are designed via an integral cross-tracking docking method to drive the underwater vehicle to move along the desired docking path. Then, an adaptive neural network (NN) controller is designed to track the desired yaw and pitch angles using command filtered backstepping, in which a single-hidden-layer (SHL) neural network is employed to compensate for dynamic uncertainties and external disturbances. A barrier Lyapunov function is defined to improve the stability of tracking errors under attitude constraints to ensure the features are in the field of view, and hyperbolic tangent functions are utilized to deal with input saturation. Simulation studies and pool experiments are provided to demonstrate the performances of the proposed visual docking controller.

AB Following the appearance of electrical vehicles and autonomous driving, a new in-vehicle network architecture is required that should be able to process substantial sensor data and communicate with other vehicles or infrastructure. Ethernet is considered a promising technology for replacing existing communication networks due to its stability and large bandwidth. Among various types of Ethernet, 10BASE-T1S can play a significant role in connecting multiple nodes in a bus structure at each zone of the zone-based network architecture. Although its latency is reduced using the physical layer collision avoidance (PLCA) algorithm, it is not small enough to be adopted in safety and powertrain domains, which require a very small delay of less than a few hundred microseconds. Therefore, this study uses node prioritization and packet segmentation to overcome the limitations of the existing PLCA algorithm. The former changes the transmission sequence of nodes while the latter reduces the waiting time for a packet. This paper suggests the algorithms of these schemes and analyzes the performance.

AB This paper presents a method for queue length estimation from connected vehicles equipped with range measurement sensors such as light detection and ranging, stereo camera, and ultrasonic. Simple plug-and-play models are developed for queue length esti-mations that do not require ground truth queue lengths. The proposed method is simple to implement and can be adopted to cyclic queues like traffic signals with known phase lengths. The models are evaluated with microscopic traffic simulations and connected ve-hicle field test data. Compared to queue length estimations without range sensors, the nu-merical experiments performed using microsimulations show that the model with range sensors improves the errors by 25% in variance-to-mean ratio and 5% in coefficient of vari-ation at less than 20% market penetration rates. Using the connected vehicle field test data, it is observed that the fusing range sensor can improve close to 10% without sen-sor estimators, 30% of the queue back, and 48% of the Highway Capacity Manual's control delay-based estimations at about 25% market penetration rate.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MICRO AIR VEHICLES
LA English
DT Article
DE Distance estimation; monocular vision; optical flow; efference copy;
   autonomous landing
ID DOCKING
AB Monocular vision is increasingly used in micro air vehicles for navigation. In particular, optical flow, inspired by flying insects, is used to perceive vehicle movement with respect to the surroundings or sense changes in the environment. However, optical flow does not directly provide us the distance to an object or velocity, but the ratio of them. Thus, using optical flow in control involves nonlinearity problems which add complexity to the controller. To deal with that, we propose an algorithm that estimates distance and velocity of the vehicle based on optical flow measured from a monocular camera and the knowledge of control inputs. This algorithm applies an extended Kalman filter to state estimation and uses the estimates for landing control. We implement and test our algorithm in computer simulation and on board a Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 to demonstrate its feasibility for micro air vehicles landings. Results of the simulation and multiple flight tests show that the algorithm is able to estimate height and velocity of the micro air vehicles accurately, and achieves smooth landings with these estimates, even in windy outdoor environments.

TI Gauging intelligence of unmanned vehicle systems - An IGVC perspective
SO JOURNAL OF ROBOTIC SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper offers an approach for defining and gauging the intelligence of an unmanned vehicle system. The meaning of "intelligence," as in natural intelligence and machine intelligence, varies greatly depending on the context in which the word is used. The paper describes certain basic expectations associated with being intelligent in general, and proceeds to present three possible means of gauging the intelligent behavior of an unmanned vehicle system (UVS). The first is a qualitative perception that is based on an extension of the Turin's test for perceiving an unsuspecting UVS behavior as that of a person. The second is a quantitative measure where task-specific intelligence performance of a smart system is evaluated. Examples of task-specific intelligence and how they are gauged are presented in the context of the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition. The third is the comparative scale that gauges the difficulty of challenges against the intelligent skills of humans. For example, an experiment revealed that it requires the mind of at least a four-year-old child to successfully navigate an autonomous navigation course. Alternative architectures for intelligent unmanned vehicle systems were also presented, including complementing machine intelligence with human supervision via telematics and information technology.

AB We evaluate both a natural field experiment and quasi-experimental variation in commute times for a shared transportation service provided by a large technology company during morning and afternoon commutes. We find that reduced commute times of roughly 2.5 minutes through expanded high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes and brand new coaches both significantly increased ridership by roughly 5.5%. We leverage these insights to describe some insights for public transit designers. We also highlight the importance of correctly specifying standard errors in randomized control trials (RCTs) with a small number of clusters: p-values increase by multiple orders of magnitudes when appropriately bootstrapping standard errors.

Applications may include simulations of autonomous aerial refuelling and formation flying scenarios. A novel wake vortex model has been developed and successfully integrated within a Matlab/Simulink simulation environment. The wake vortex model is both sufficiently representative to support studies of aerodynamic interaction between multiple air vehicles, and straightforward enough to be used within real time or near real time air-to-air simulations. The model integration process is described, and Computational results of a two-vehicle-formation flight are presented.

AB Due to the high demands on military and commercial applications, the development of UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) has become increasingly important in recent years. In this paper, we present a vision guided autonomous navigation approach for quadrotor UAVs. A map-based offline path planning technique is developed to generate an initial path, followed by the waypoints of the trajectory for flight guidance. During the navigation, an onboard camera is utilized to acquire a sequence of monocular images for environment perception. A vision-based obstacle detection technique using optical flow is proposed for collision avoidance. The optical flow field constructed from the image sequence is used to provide the depth cues for the incoming obstacle detection. A single-board computer is adopted as a control platform, and the proposed algorithms are implemented for online and real-time processing. Several experiments are carried out in the outdoor environment for obstacles avoidance and visual guidance. The results have demonstrated the feasibility of our proposed method for path planning and autonomous navigation.

AB Underwater terrain-matching navigation technologies have become a popular topic for the high-precision positioning and navigation of autonomous underwater vehicles. This paper proposes an underwater terrain-matching positioning method based on a Markov random field model, which is based on real-time terrain data obtained using a multi-beam echo sounder. It focuses on the strong correlation between adjacent terrain data, which can improve terrain adaptability and matching accuracy. Playback simulation tests were conducted based on actual sea trial data, and the results showed that the proposed method has good positioning performance, which can correct the cumulative errors of inertial navigation systems. The results demonstrated the usability of the proposed method for positioning correction in underwater engineering applications.

TI Minimizing Traffic Congestion Through Continuous-Time Route Reservations
   With Travel Time Predictions
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT VEHICLES

DT Article
DE Autonomous vehicles; connected; traffic control and optimization of
   transportation systems
AB Road traffic congestion occurs as demand exceeds infrastructure's capacity. In this paper, we propose a continuous-time route reservation architecture to efficiently manage vehicle routing decisions thus to eliminate congested conditions. The related problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programme (MILP) that routes vehicles while avoiding road segments that reach their critical density. To reduce the high computational complexity of the MILP approach, we develop a heuristic algorithm, which is shown to perform well compared to the MILP formulation. The heuristic algorithm is used to conduct extensive microsimulations across a real network topology of the San Francisco area. Finally, an extension of the proposed architecture is also developed, where the modeling uncertainties are considered through a time-varying regression method making able in real-time accurate travel-time predictions minimizing the reservation errors.

AB This article concerns the problem of event-triggered observer-based output feedback control of spatially distributed processes under the autonomous operation of an unmanned aerial vehicle. The specific spatially distributed process is modeled within the distributed parameter systems framework. To control the considered distributed parameter system efficiently, we first estimate the states with an observer based on the measurement information from sensors. Then, an event-triggered observer-based controller is designed, which can reduce the frequency of signal transmissions between the observer and the controller. In contrast to normal sampled-data controller that is updated periodically, the event-triggered controller is updated only when an "event'' happens. Moreover, the Zeno behavior is also excluded by proving there exists a lower bound for interexecution time. Numerical simulations are finally presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.

ID ATTENTION; FASTER
AB Successfully detecting road objects from camera sensors in various traffic environments would significantly facilitate the development of driving safety applications for autonomous driving. However, object occlusion, bad weather, and small objects in images would restrict the performance of object detection approaches based on camera sensors. To resolve these issues, a lightweight neural network modified convolutional block attention mechanism (MCBAM)-CenterNet was proposed. In this approach, convolutional block attention module (CBAM) was used to find the focus in an image to enhance the detection capability. The lite-hourglass module was then adopted specifically for the detection of cars and pedestrians. A large-scale realistic road object detection dataset BDD100K that includes various traffic images from camera sensors was adopted in this article to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed MCBAM-CenterNet. The evaluation results show that MCBAM-CenterNet can effectively detect road objects under different scenarios.

AB The problem of steering multiple fixed-wing autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to follow the multiple noncooperative and high agile surface targets at a specified standoff distance in a threat environment is studied. Two kinds of threats and missed detection of bearing-only sensors are considered. The average nonlinear least-square estimation method is proposed to acquire the position of the targets using noisy measurements, and then, the trajectories of the targets are approximated by the quadratic functions of time. Dummy targets of the same number as UAVs are created according to the task allocation result to achieve the optimal geometric configuration of the multiple cooperative UAVs. And a case-based guidance method is established to finally accomplish the multi-target standoff following mission on-line. Simulation experiments are given to assess the proposed method.

AB The tire longitudinal properties exhibit highly nonlinear dynamical behaviors influenced by the tire slip coefficient, the road longitudinal adhesion coefficient, and the tire vertical load. This paper presents a system identification approach to approximate such a nonlinear dynamic for autonomous driving controller design. The tire longitudinal properties tests are conducted using a flat-plate test bench. On the basis of the experimental data, the piecewise affine (PWA) identification of the tire longitudinal properties involves the classification of the cluster data and the parameter estimation of the affine submodels. Using the least-square algorithm, the parameter vectors of the affine submodels are estimated, and the problem of region partition is solved via heuristic approach. The simulation results of the identified PWA model match the experimental data accurately, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed identification approach for the tire longitudinal properties.

DE Autonomous truck platoon; Computational fluid dynamics; Fuel-saving;
   Pavement fatigue
AB Autonomous truck platoons are currently proposed to drive in an aligned form for saving fuel, which will cause repeated wheel loads and shorten pavements' service life. Therefore, platoon's form needs to be reconsidered. Several forms were proposed from the aspects of vehicle number, longitudinal interval and lateral offset. Their influence was evaluated based on the computational fluid dynamics simulations and finite element model. Parameters in the simulations were collected from laboratory tests. The average fuel-saving rate for a two-truck platoon is 3.8-8.9% when the longitudinal interval varies from 5L to 0.5L. The fuel-saving rate, however, grows at a decreasing rate with the increase in truck number. Besides, the lateral offset is found to be effective when organizing the two-truck platoon, and above 30% decrease in pavement fatigue damage and 8% fuel savings will be obtained concurrently. The findings help the policy makers to reconsider the management of platoons.

AB This paper presents a framework for performing autonomous precise landing of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on dynamic targets. The main goal of this work is to design the methodology and the controlling algorithms that will allow multi-rotor drones to perform a robust and efficient landing in dynamic conditions of changing wind, dynamic obstacles, and moving targets. Unlike existing GNSS-based vertical landing solutions, the suggested framework does not rely on global positioning and uses adaptive diagonal approaching angle visual landing. The framework was designed to work on existing camera-drone platforms, without any need for additional sensors, and it was implemented using DJI's API on Android devices. The presented concept of visual sliding landing (VSL) was tested on a wide range of commercial drones, performing hundreds of precise and robust autonomous landings on dynamic targets, including boats, cars, RC-boats, and RC-rovers.

AB This paper studies the hybrid event-triggered tracking control based on an unmanned autonomous helicopter (UAH) and an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) under unmeasurable states, transmission delay, external disturbance, and deception attacks. By designing a switching condition, a hybrid event -triggered scheme (ETS) is proposed to realize an elegant trade-off between less data transmissions and control performance. Then, based on the designs of the observer and tracking controller, an augmented closed-loop system is established, and a sufficient condition on uniform ultimate boundedness is presented. Moreover, a co-design method of the hybrid ETS, observer, and controller is obtained via linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which is further extended by utilizing an improved adaptive hybrid ETS. Finally, some simulation and comparisons are exploited to illustrate the proposed method.(c) 2022 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are getting popular because of their usage in a wide range of applications like delivery systems, self-driving taxis, and ambulances. AVs utilize the power of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms to improve their self-driving learning experiences. The sudden surge in the number of AVs raises the need for distributed learning ecosystem to optimize their self-driving experiences at a rapid pace. Toward this goal, federated learning (FL) benefits, which can create a distributed learning environment for AVs. But, the traditional FL transfers the raw input data directly to a server, which leads to privacy concerns among the end-users. The concept of blockchain helps us to protect privacy, but it requires additional computational infrastructure. The extra infrastructure increases the operational cost for the company handling and maintaining the AVs. Motivated by this, in this paper, the authors introduced the concept of gradient encryption in FL, which preserves the users' privacy without the additional computation requirements. The computational power present in the edge devices helps to fine-tune the local model and encrypt the input data to preserve privacy without any drop in performance. For performance evaluation, the authors have built a German traffic sign recognition system using a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm-based classification system and GeFL. The simulation process is carried out over a wide range of input parameters to analyze the performance at scale. Simulation results of GeFL outperform the conventional FL-based algorithms in terms of accuracy, i.e., 2% higher. Also, the amount of data transferred among the devices in the network is nearly three times less in GeFL compared to the traditional FL.

AB The demand for transport between terminals within port areas, known as inter terminal transportation (ITT), is increasing. This paper proposes a dynamic rolling horizon scheduling strategy for ITT using a fleet of waterborne Autonomous Guided Vessels (waterborne AGVs). The strategy is dynamic in that it can handle dynamically arriving ITT requests. Every certain period of time, transport schedules are updated according to the current vessel states, dynamic waterway transport network, and ITT requests over a future time horizon. Specifically, the dynamic scheduling problem is mathematically modeled in a rolling horizon fashion considering time windows of ITT requests, capacity limits of waterborne AGVs and load/unload service times at terminals. Considering the computational complexity for possible large scale ITT scenarios, we further propose an efficient solution approach based on improved insertion, tabu search and restart heuristics. Initial routes are first constructed by inserting new ITT requests into the previously computed routes in the rolling horizon framework. Tabu search with two types of neighborhoods are then designed to improve the initial routes. Moreover, a select-remove-insert restart procedure is activated to diversify the search space whenever necessary. A waterborne ITT network in the port of Rotterdam is considered. Comprehensive simulations based on realistic ITT dataset are run to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic scheduling strategy. This work could be readily used to build towards a fully autonomous waterborne ITT system. Insights that support long term strategical decisions, such as the fleet size, could also be gained from the simulations.

AB As lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are used in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) power systems, their thermal safety and reliability have seriously inhibited the development of AUVs toward high speed and long voyage. However, the related research on AUVs' battery thermal management is very limited. In this article, a novel and efficient liquid cooling scheme is proposed, for battery thermal management of AUV, which adopts bionic wave cooling channels. A three-dimensional heat dissipation model of the battery was developed, which considered the influence of battery internal resistance and state of charge on battery heat generation. The effects of discharge rate, channel shape, coolant mass flow rate, coolant inlet direction, and dynamic operation strategy on the battery maximum temperature and temperature variation were investigated during discharging process. It was found that the battery with bionic wave channels was superior to the battery with straight channels, regarding cooling efficiency. The maximum temperature and temperature difference of the former decreased by 12.8 and 5.3 K compared with the latter at 5C current discharging rate. Based on the bionic wave channels, increasing the mass flow rate of coolant was the most efficient route to reducing the maximum temperature and improving the uniformity of the battery temperature. A mass flow rate equal to 2.5 x 10(-4) kg s(-1) is reasonably recommended by considering the cooling efficiency comprehensively. The direction of the coolant inlet had little effect on the maximum temperature of the battery, but it significantly improved the uniformity of the battery temperature. Under the premise of meeting the cruising requirements of AUVs, alternating low-rate and high-rate discharge was more conducive to improving the temperature behavior of the battery. The conclusions of this article can provide reference for the battery thermal management system of AUVs.

AB The vision system is important for almost all kinds of autonomous driving systems. However, visual data interfered by scattering media, such as smoke, haze, water, and other non-uniform media will be degraded seriously, showing the characteristics of detail loss, poor contrast, low visibility, or color distortion. These characteristics can significantly interfere with the reliability of autonomous driving systems. In real environments the image degradation mechanism is complex, and the estimation of degradation parameters is difficult. This issue remains to be solved. In this study, we employed dense blocks as the framework and introduced the attention mechanism to our model from four dimensions: Multi-scale Attention, Channel Attention, Structure Attention, and ROI (region of interest) Attention. With the help of the training data provided by the weakly supervised model, the proposed method achieved excellent performance in the task of scattering medium imaging optimization in different scenes. Comparative experiments show that the proposed method is robust, and is superior to other state-of-the-art methods in image dehazing, and underwater image enhancement tasks. It is of great significance to improve the reliability of autonomous driving systems in underwater and severe weather environments.

AB This paper presents a model to estimate the future adoption of connected autonomous trucks (CATs) by freight transportation organizations. An accurate estimation of the market penetration rate of CATs is necessary to adequately prepare the infrastructure and legislation needed to support the technology. Building upon the theory of Diffusion of Innovations, we develop Bass models for various freight transportation innovations, including improved tractor and trailer aerodynamics, and anti-idling technologies for trucks. The proposed model accounts for heterogeneity between organizations by using a modified Bass model to vary parameters within a designated range for each of the potentially adopting organizations. The results of the paper are Bass models for existing freight organization innovation adoption and estimates of multiple scenarios of CAT adoption over time by freight organizations within the case study region of Shelby County, Tennessee and provide a foundation for organizational innovation adoption research. Our analyses suggest that the market penetration rate of CATs within 25 years varies from nearly universal adoption (i.e., more than 95%) to 20% or less depending on the rate at which autonomous technology improves over time, changes in public opinion on autonomous technology, and the addition of external influencing factors such as price and marketing.

AB Due to the high cost of driving testing and the data collection for autonomous cars in the real world, transferring driving models from the simulator to the real world is significant and urgent. This article proposes a novel virtual-to-real driving (VRDriving) framework based on adversarial learning, which is able to transfer the ability of end-to-end learning models trained by simulation virtual data sets to the real world. The framework consists of three parts: 1) an end-to-end learning-based estimator with the cost-sensitive loss function for driving commands estimation; 2) an encoder for extracting the driving domain features from unlabeled real driving images; and 3) a discriminator for distinguishing whether the virtual driving domain features are real or fake. The above three modules can be trained simultaneously. With such a novel learning framework, the driving domain features encoded from the real images are closer to the driving domain features inside the end-to-end estimator via adversarial learning mechanism. Three experiments show the proposed VRDriving framework performs the state-of-the-art estimation accuracy of the steering command than several baselines and other typical frameworks. Therefore, the VRDriving framework is promising to improve the development efficiency of future autonomous driving.

AB Researchers in diverse fields, such as in neuroscience, systems biology and autonomous robotics, have been intrigued by the origin and mechanisms for biological robustness. Darwinian evolution, in general, has suggested that adaptive mechanisms as a way of reaching robustness, could evolve by natural selection acting successively on numerous heritable variations. However, is this understanding enough for realizing how biological systems remain robust during their interactions with the surroundings? Here, we describe selected studies of bio-inspired systems that show behavioral robustness. From neurorobotics, cognitive, self-organizing and artificial immune system perspectives, our discussions focus mainly on how robust behaviors evolve or emerge in these systems, having the capacity of interacting with their surroundings. These descriptions are twofold. Initially, we introduce examples from autonomous robotics to illustrate how the process of designing robust control can be idealized in complex environments for autonomous navigation in terrain and underwater vehicles. We also include descriptions of bio-inspired self-organizing systems. Then, we introduce other studies that contextualize experimental evolution with simulated organisms and physical robots to exemplify how the process of natural selection can lead to the evolution of robustness by means of adaptive behaviors.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming popular nowadays due to their versatility and flexibility for indoor applications, such as the autonomous visual inspection of the inner surface of a pressure vessel. Nevertheless, robust and reliable position estimation is critical for completing these tasks. Visual odometry (VO) and visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM) allow the UAV to estimate its position in unknown environments. However, traditional feature-based VO/VSLAM systems struggle to deal with complex scenes such as low illumination and textureless environments. Replacing the traditional features with deep learning-based features provides the advantage of handling the challenging environment, but the efficiency is ignored. In this work, an efficient VO system based on a novel lightweight feature extraction network for UAV onboard platforms has been developed. The deformable convolution (DFConv) is utilized to improve the feature extraction capability. Owing to the limited onboard computing capability, the depthwise separable convolution (DWConv) is adopted to calculate the offsets for the DFConv and construct the backbone network to improve the feature extraction efficiency. Experiments on public datasets indicate that the efficiency of the VO system is improved by 30.03% while preserving the accuracy on embedded platforms with the feature points and descriptors detected by the proposed convolutional neural network (CNN). Moreover, the proposed VO system is verified through UAV flying tests in a real-world scenario. The results prove that the proposed VO system is able to handle the challenging environments where both the latest traditional and deep learning feature-based VO/VSLAM systems fail, and it is feasible for UAV self-localization and autonomous navigation in the confined, low illumination and textureless indoor environment.

AB Autonomous vehicles are the near future of the automobile industry. However, until they reach Level 5, humans and cars will share this intermediate future. Therefore, studying the transition between autonomous and manual modes is a fascinating topic. Automated vehicles may still need to occasionally hand the control to drivers due to technology limitations and legal requirements. This paper presents a study of driver behaviour in the transition between autonomous and manual modes using a CARLA simulator. To our knowledge, this is the first take-over study with transitions conducted on this simulator. For this purpose, we obtain driver gaze focalization and fuse it with the road's semantic segmentation to track to where and when the user is paying attention, besides the actuators' reaction-time measurements provided in the literature. To track gaze focalization in a non-intrusive and inexpensive way, we use a method based on a camera developed in previous works. We devised it with the OpenFace 2.0 toolkit and a NARMAX calibration method. It transforms the face parameters extracted by the toolkit into the point where the user is looking on the simulator scene. The study was carried out by different users using our simulator, which is composed of three screens, a steering wheel and pedals. We distributed this proposal in two different computer systems due to the computational cost of the simulator based on the CARLA simulator. The robot operating system (ROS) framework is in charge of the communication of both systems to provide portability and flexibility to the proposal. Results of the transition analysis are provided using state-of-the-art metrics and a novel driver situation-awareness metric for 20 users in two different scenarios.

AB The introduction of fully automated vehicles (FAVs) will change user experiences (UX) in personal transportation. In order for FAVs to become a life enhancing technology, it is required to design vehicular applications and user interfaces based on users' expectations. To this end, we investigated user needs and design requirements. First, we elicited design taxonomy and use cases through literature review and trend analysis. Using these materials, expert interviews (N = 9) and focus group interviews (N = 10) were conducted. Through the qualitative analysis, we obtained twelve categories of user needs and devised design requirements based on the updated design taxonomy. While some of them have been an extension of current experiences in manual driving, completely new demands have also emerged within FAVs. Our findings contribute to designing UX in FAVs by satisfying users' expectations and key values that can guide designers.

AB We address the problem of optimally controlling connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) crossing an urban intersection without any explicit traffic signaling, so as to minimize energy consumption subject to a throughput maximization requirement. We show that the solution of the throughput maximization problem depends only on the hard safety constraints imposed on CAVs and its structure enables a decentralized optimal control problem formulation for energy minimization. We present a complete analytical solution of these decentralized problems and derive conditions under which feasible solutions satisfying all safety constraints always exist. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is illustrated through simulation which shows substantial dual benefits of the proposed decentralized framework by allowing CAVs to conserve momentum and fuel while also improving travel time.

AB Vehicular clouds (VCs) have become a promising research area due to its on-demand solutions, resource pooling, unified services, autonomous cloud formation and transformational management. It makes use of the underutilized resources of vehicles on the parking lot, roadways, driveways and streets, and creates the infrastructure to support various services offered by the cloud service provider (CSP) by deploying virtual machines (VMs). However, these vehicles can leave the coverage/grid of VC due to its mobility and change in the environment. Therefore, the hosted VMs on those vehicles can be transferred to other potential vehicles (i.e., migration) in order to avoid disruption of services. These services can be viewed as user requests (URs) submitted to the CSP by cloud users. Here, the challenging tasks are to map the URs to the VMs (or vehicles) and identify the potential vehicles for migration, and they need immediate attention. In this paper, we propose a smart cloud service management (SCSM) algorithm for VCs and address the above challenges. This algorithm consists of three phases, namely assignment of vehicles to grids, URs to grids and URs to vehicles by considering the mobility pattern of vehicles. The performance of SCSM is assessed using three traffic congestion scenarios and thirty-six instances of four datasets, and compared with round-robin (RR) and deficit weighted RR (DWRR) using seven performance metrics. The comparison results show that SCSM achieves 58% and 57% (33% and 33%) better than RR and DWRR in makespan (number of migrations) and other performance metrics.

AB In this paper, a comprehensive deterministic Eco-Driving strategy for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) is presented. In this setup, multiple driving modes calculate speed profiles that are ideal for their own set of constraints simultaneously to save fuel as much as possible, while a High-Level (HL) controller ensures smooth and safe transitions between the driving modes for Eco-Driving. This Eco-Driving deterministic controller for an ego CAV was equipped with Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) algorithms. This comprehensive Eco-Driving strategy and its individual components were tested by using simulations to quantify the fuel economy performance. Simulation results are used to show that the HL controller ensures significant fuel economy improvement as compared to baseline driving modes with no collisions between the ego CAV and traffic vehicles, while the driving mode of the ego CAV was set correctly under changing constraints. For the microscopic traffic simulations, a 6.41% fuel economy improvement was observed for the CAV that was controlled by this comprehensive Eco-Driving strategy.

AB Platooning is an emerging transportation practice that has the potential to solve the problems of the burgeoning transportation industry. A platoon is a group of vehicles, with vehicle to vehicle communication, that travel closely behind one another such that the platoon can accelerate, brake and cruise together. Platoons can improve road safety, be energy efficient and reduce costs. Its complete socio-economic benefits include congestion mitigation, smoother traffic flow, better lane usage and throughput, incentives for green logistics and driver safety. The long-term effect of platooning on road transportation, if extensively deployed, would be better organised traffic flow and efficient tracking of vehicles on the road ushering a multilevel positive impact on the industry. In this study, we attempt to answer the critical question of whether platooning is an adoptable practice in the near future and discuss an agenda to take platooning closer to implementation on the ground by highlighting the opportunities for future research. We also present a conceptual framework to help researchers, academicians, policy makers and practitioners for the adoption of platooning into the transportation industry.

AB The current remarkable development of communication technology is enabling the intelligent driving system by providing a V2X network to exchange and process transportation data. However, security, as a fundamental requirement, is still lacking in many aspects of current V2X networks. For V2X networks, low latency, as a critical requirement for V2X networks, restrains usage of traditional security functions as security related operations like Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) systems also introduce latency. In this article, we propose an efficient scheme by intelligently distributing keys for authentication in V2X networks. The general design is to distribute key pairs valid according to the location information for vehicles and RoadSide Units (RSUs). Thus, based on this authentication scheme relying on location information, keys can be pre-distributed according to the vehicles' future locations. Also, we propose to use the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict the future route and locations which can let the key requests started from the vehicles' ends. The key idea is to provide an intelligent and efficient key distribution protocol for V2X networks. Some experimental results prove the efficiency with evaluations on our proposal compared with the existing solution.

AB Poor user experience is caused by the current unstable operation of the two-wheel self-balancing vehicle control system, the high failure rate, and the poor accuracy and sensitivity of the control system (prone to deviation). Therefore, the work studied the two-wheel self-balancing vehicle system with the visual recognition of vehicle attitude. Kalman filtering and PID control algorithm were adopted to reduce the high frequency interference of the accelerometer and the low frequency error of the gyroscope, improve the response speed and control precision of motor to error, and ensure vertical control. The road images were acquired by a charge-coupled device vision sensor with the edge information extracted by the Laplacian operator, which ensures autonomous navigation control of a balance car. Based on the calculation of the distance between road axis and the existence detection of forward obstacles, the early warning mechanism was established through the calculation of the group agent to improve the safety performance of a balance vehicle. Experiments showed the improved control system has good stability, fast walking speed, strong anti-interference, and high security.

AB This paper describes an integrated vehicle control system with visual feedback. A general-purpose, low-level feature matching method, able to work in real time without any strict assumptions on the environment structure or camera parameters, generates low-level matching results, which are used as source of data for applications like mobile object tracking, among others. A generalized predictive path-tracking control approach keeps the vehicle on the trajectory defined by the moving target. In the low-level matching process, block-based features (windows) are selected and tracked along a stream of monocular images; least residual square error and similarity between clusters of features are used as constraints to select the right matching pair between multiple candidates. Real-time performance is achieved through optimized algorithms and a parallel DSP-based multiprocessor system implementation. Object detection and tracking is motion-based, and does not require a predefined model of the target. The integrated control system has been tested on the ROMEO-3R experimental vehicle.

AB Accurate and robust localization using multi-modal sensors is crucial for autonomous driving applications. Although wheel encoder measurements can provide additional velocity information for visual-inertial odometry (VIO), the existing visual-inertial-wheel odometry (VIWO) still cannot avoid long-term drift caused by the low-precision attitude acquired by the gyroscope of a low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU), especially in visually restricted scenes where the visual information cannot accurately correct for the IMU bias. In this work, leveraging the powerful data processing capability of deep learning, we propose a novel tightly coupled monocular visual-inertial-wheel odometry with neural gyroscope calibration (NGC) to obtain accurate, robust, and long-term localization for autonomous vehicles. First, to cure the drift of the gyroscope, we design a robust neural gyroscope calibration network for low-cost IMU gyroscope measurements (called NGC-Net). Following a carefully deduced mathematical calibration model, NGC-Net leverages the temporal convolutional network to extract different scale features from raw IMU measurements in the past and regress the gyroscope corrections to output the de-noised gyroscope. A series of experiments on public datasets show that our NGC-Net has better performance on gyroscope de-noising than learning methods and competes with state-of-the-art VIO methods. Moreover, based on the more accurate de-noised gyroscope, an effective strategy for combining the advantages of VIWO and NGC-Net outputs is proposed in a tightly coupled framework, which significantly improves the accuracy of the state-of-the-art VIO/VIWO methods. In long-term and large-scale urban environments, our RNGC-VIWO tracking system performs robustly, and experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of robustness and accuracy.

AB The visual-inertial integrated navigation system (VINS) has been extensively studied over the past decades to provide accurate and low-cost positioning solutions for autonomous systems. Satisfactory performance can be obtained in an ideal scenario with sufficient and static environment features. However, there are usually numerous dynamic objects in deep urban areas, and these moving objects can severely distort the feature-tracking process which is critical to the feature-based VINS. One well-known method that mitigates the effects of dynamic objects is to detect vehicles using deep neural networks and remove the features belonging to surrounding vehicles. However, excessive feature exclusion can severely distort the geometry of feature distribution, leading to limited visual measurements. Instead of directly eliminating the features from dynamic objects, this study proposes to adopt the visual measurement model based on the quality of feature tracking to improve the performance of the VINS. First, a self-tuning covariance estimation approach is proposed to model the uncertainty of each feature measurement by integrating two parts: (1) the geometry of feature distribution (GFD); (2) the quality of feature tracking. Second, an adaptive M-estimator is proposed to correct the measurement residual model to further mitigate the effects of outlier measurements, like the dynamic features. Different from the conventional M-estimator, the proposed method effectively alleviates the reliance on the excessive parameterization of the M-estimator. Experiments were conducted in typical urban areas of Hong Kong with numerous dynamic objects. The results show that the proposed method could effectively mitigate the effects of dynamic objects and improved accuracy of the VINS is obtained when compared with the conventional VINS method.

AB After several decades of stock decline, the Atlantic sea scallop ( Placopecten magellanicus) resource has rebounded to become one of the most valuable fisheries in the United States. The continued sustainability of this fishery is supported by catch limits determined by annual stock projection models. Incidental mortality is an important term in these projection models, but is historically difficult to measure. Current estimates are derived from field experiments that relied heavily on qualitative observations and as a result are based on limited data with low precision. To better quantify incidental mortality, a multiple before-after-control-impact experimental design was used to measure the effect of scallop dredging on the disposition of sea scallops that remain uncaptured on the seafloor following dredging. An autonomous underwater vehicle was used to collect color photographs and side-scan sonar images of the seafloor before and after controlled dredge treatments in the mid-Atlantic and Georges Bank regions. Approximately 170,000 photographs were annotated for instances of mortality. Dredge-induced incidental mortality of 2.5% and 8% was estimated for the mid-Atlantic Bight and Georges Bank sites, respectively, a difference that is likely attributable to the relatively harder substrate of the scallop habitat on Georges Bank that results in greater physical trauma to the uncaptured scallops. This study provides a quantitative estimate of incidental mortality using a noninvasive platform that offers precise mission navigation for repeated surveys. The spatial scale and distribution of the study sites are broad relative to past incidental mortality studies, and the substrate types at each are common in the sea scallop fishery. Estimated mortality rates are lower than the values currently used in fishery stock models and suggest the existing values are conservative, but likely appropriate estimates for management purposes.

AB "Everything somewhere" or "something everywhere" is the classic dilemma concerning the development and implementation of the future generation of vehicles, i.e., automated vehicles (AVs). Both strategies include diverse policy options that could significantly impact road networks' planning, design, operation, and utilization. Until now, no significant research has been conducted concerning their implications. In this paper, we aim to examine how ready the current physical infrastructure is by identifying the requirements of each strategy and then applying them in a common type of intersection. The study's findings demonstrate that AVs' performance can be affected by policy implementation decisions and adds further weight to the argument of AVs separation or no-separation from no-AVs traffic. Furthermore, the insignificant improvements in traffic performance imply the low readiness of the current road networks in urban areas to accommodate the new technology. This study contributes to determining that research on the readiness of the road infrastructure and the deployment of AVs in urban areas is inevitable. It also identifies that roads' geometric design can dramatically affect AVs' operation and the difficulties of implementing dedicated lanes in urban areas due to space availability.

AB With the increasing popularity of autonomous vehicles, the maritime industry has focused on the development of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS). An essential aspect of autonomous ships is their ability to follow a predetermined path at sea, as deviations from this path can jeopardize navigational safety, leading to accidents like collisions and grounding incidents. Therefore, ensuring that autonomous ships can safely navigate by following predefined routes is of utmost importance. Simultaneously, the implementation of the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has raised interest in a ship's manoeuvring performance in adverse sea conditions, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) has provided guidelines to determine the minimum propulsion power required to maintain ship manoeuvrability in adverse conditions. This study investigates the pathfollowing performance of a ship operating at low forward speeds in adverse weather conditions using a freerunning Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model, enabling accurate prediction of manoeuvring behaviour. The numerical results emphasise the significance of low forward speeds in enabling a ship to follow a predetermined route, offering valuable insights into path-following performance with minimum propulsion power in adverse weather. The study reveals that increasing propulsive power reduces deviations from the predetermined route when the ship encounters bow and beam waves. However, the impact of propulsion power on deviation is negligible in quartering waves during path-following control. This research contributes to improving guidelines for minimum ship powering, ensuring safe autonomous navigation in adverse weather conditions.

The expressions for the single and dual command travel times have been determined assuming uniform distributed storage locations and the probability theory. A simulation model has been applied for the performance analysis of the proposed analytical models.

We present the results of designing, software implementation, training, and testing of our RBF model for automatic road direction detection as a function of the input image. The path to be identified was quantified in 5 output directions. For training and testing the neural model, we used two lots of real road scenes: 50 images for training and other 50 images for test. The score of correct road recognition was of 100% both for estimation lot and also for the test lot. We have also designed a driving simulator to evaluate the performances of the neural road follower.

AB This paper presents an efficient hierarchical motion planning framework with a long planning horizon for autonomous driving in structured environments. A 3D motion planning with time information is a non-convex problem because there exists more than one local minimum point and various constraints such as roads and obstacles. Accordingly, to deal with high computational complexity and the problem of falling into a local minimum in an enormous solution space, a decoupled method is utilized, that consists of two steps: Long-term planning and short-term planning. First, the long-term planner provides reasonable far-sighted behavior through two processes. In the first process, a rough path that includes a driving strategy is generated in the 2D spatial space. Then, the jump point search algorithm is utilized with time information on the path to reduce the computational burden of A*, giving an acceptable quality of solution at the same time. In this step, a safe, comfortable, and dynamically feasible trajectory is generated. Next, the short-term planner optimizes a short-sighted trajectory using particle swarm optimization. In this method, a steering angle set is encoded as a particle, resulting in a safe, comfortable, and kinodynamically feasible trajectory. The proposed algorithm is implemented and evaluated in a range of vehicle-in-the-loop simulation scenarios, which include various virtual static and dynamic obstacles generated by Intelligent Driver Model. In the evaluation results, the proposed method reduced the computation time by up to 0.696 s with increasing the step cost by up to about 3%. The proposed algorithm is executed every 100 ms for a planning horizon of 10 seconds, and the average computation time is 31 ms with the worst-case computation time of 94 ms.

AB While the interest of the transport research community and automotive industry is increasingly turning towards developments and improvements in the field of autonomous vehicles, there is a need for a better understanding of the end users' preferences regarding perceived passenger comfort, in order to improve acceptance and intention to use. The present study is based on a driving simulator experiment conducted at the University of Leeds Driving Simulator and approaches the issue of comfort via observed speed choice behaviour. Participants drove a series of driving simulator scenarios composed of road segments of different road type, road geometry, risk level at the road edge, and oncoming traffic. They also completed a series of self-report questionnaires, including Arnett's Inventory of Sensation-seeking. A set of models was developed in order to investigate the effects of road environment and sensation-seeking on speed behaviour. The initial model only considered explanatory variables related to the road environment and accounted for individual unobserved heterogeneity. Past behaviour, serial correlation and heterogeneity in road environment were then introduced in the model specification. The autoregressive disturbance term that accounted for serial correlation was also applied in the form of a random variable and significantly improved model fit. Finally, sensation-seeking was incorporated in the model as a latent variable. The results showed a significant impact of most of the road elements as road type, curvature, risk type at the road edge on observed behaviour, implying a future need for the development of autonomous vehicle controllers that adapt their performance based on the road environment. Moreover, sensation-seeking had a significant and positive effect on speed, which indicates a potential future demand for personalised controllers to meet the users' individual preferences.

AB This paper proposes an improved intelligent driver model (IDM) by considering the information of multiple front and rear vehicles to describe the car-following behaviour of CAVs (Connected and autonomous vehicles). The model involves the velocity and acceleration of multiple front and rear vehicles as well as the velocity difference and headway between the host vehicle and its surrounding vehicles. By introducing location-related parameters, the model quantitatively expresses the change in influence degree of a surrounding vehicle with its location to the host vehicle. To maximize traffic stability, we obtain the optimal value of the parameters in the model and the effect of specific time delays on the stability of traffic flow with numerical simulation. The results indicate that for a single vehicle control, the proposed model provides a much quicker and smoother acceleration and deceleration process to the desired speed than the IDM and multi-front IDM. And for fleet control, the proposed multi-front and rear IDM is superior to the other two models in decreasing the starting and braking time and increasing the stability of speed and acceleration. With effective car-following behaviour control, it is helpful to improve the operation efficiency of CAVs and enhance the stability of traffic flow. In addition to the car-following behaviour control, the model can be utilized for fleet control in the case of CAVs' homogeneous flow. This model can also serve as an effective tool to simulate car-following behaviour, which is beneficial for road traffic management and infrastructure layout in connected environments.

ID PARTICLE FILTER; CHALLENGES; PREDICTION; MODELS; EKF
AB Vehicle state including location and motion information plays an important role in various applications such as Internet of Vehicles (IoV), autonomous cars, and driving safety monitoring. Achieving accurate vehicle state is a challenging task in those applications due to the noise disturbances. Recent studies suggest that noise is not generally Gaussian distributed and many physical environments can be handled more accurately as non-Gaussian rather than Gaussian model. Inspired by this observation, we strive to improve the vehicle state estimation by investigating the effects of that assumption when process and measurement noises are non-Gaussian distributed. Here, process noise represents the noise during the state information processing. To that end, we exploit the generalized error distribution (GED) to compute the non-Gaussian probability density during the vehicle state estimation. We then derive extensive theoretical analysis targeting to estimate the parameters such as the mean and the variance (or covariance matrix) related to both process and measurement noises and reduce the computational burden of the distribution. Further, we propose a non-Gaussian particle filter for vehicle state estimation (nGPF-VSE) algorithm wherein we utilize the genetic operator resampling (GOR) technique to enhance the efficiency of particle filter (PF) relying on the selection of the importance sampling distribution. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we conduct numerical simulations on the popular system of state-space equations and a real experiment for estimating the vehicle state. The results from the numerical simulations, experimental data and the statistical evaluation confirm that nGPF-VSE outperforms existing methods in terms of vehicle state accuracy.

AB A positioning system provides useful positioning information for applications. The ability to maintain high-quality positioning information in real time is crucial. Autonomous vehicles require positioning information to plan control strategies. Inadequate positioning accuracy affects control and safety. This article explores the effect of an error detection and correction method on coordinate information fusion. This method can be used to efficiently correct positioning errors in the presence of faults. The fault detection mechanism is not limited to positioning systems with certain types of sensor applications. and it has certain flexibility in various applications. This positioning system detection method uses more than two positioning systems. Primarily, one positioning system is used to monitor the other. When the error of the positioning system differs excessively from the system setting value, the positioning fusion algorithm will make appropriate adjustments to output the corrected coordinate value. Therefore, this method integrates different positioning technologies, including a global position system (GPS), simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), inertial measurement units (IMUs), and mileage meters. Autonomous vehicles already have the required sensors deployed, and our method can be implemented at no additional cost. We integrated two positioning systems to support the positioning applications and designed a fault detection method to detect errors in the positioning system. This allowed the system to have some reference information by which to correct the coordinate information. According to the experimental findings, positioning information errors were corrected at a rate of 89.8%. The positioning system with the added detection function was able to effectively filter the data without too many errors. Additionally, the results showed that this method can effectively correct positioning errors. The results indicate that adding an error detection mechanism can effectively improve the accuracy of coordinate data fusion. Positioning systems with an error detection function can thus improve applications' performance.

AB Traffic accidents continue to increase in Korea as traffic increases, and the resulting loss of life is also on the rise. According to data surveyed by the South Korean National Police Agency, 45,921 pedestrian traffic accidents were reported in 2019, resulting in 1487 deaths and 46,400 injuries. Due to the increased interest in traffic accident safety, the Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) concept is rapidly developing and playing a significant role in coping with activities that are not recognized by the driver. Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB), a representative ADAS system, is a system that is useful for preventing and mitigating accidents by braking vehicles in emergencies. For the study of AEBs' safety evaluation methods for pedestrians, a distance measurement method using a monocular camera with excellent accessibility, and measurement equipment required to validate data on the movement of vehicles, and a dummy to replace pedestrians are used. Based on the evaluation scenario considering the proposed Korea road environment, the relative distance obtained from equipment like DGPS and the relative distance using a monocular camera is compared and analyzed to verify safety. Comparative analysis shows that the minimum deviation is 2.3 cm, the third test result of 30 km/h of Car-to-Pedestrian Nearside Child (CPNC), and the maximum deviation is 25 cm, the first test result of 25 km/h of Car-to-Pedestrian Nearside Adult (CPNA). The main factor in error generation is that the lane recognition in the camera image is not accurate, and the perception of small children is slow, which is why emergency braking is considered to have been slow. It is deemed that a safety assessment in weather conditions of adverse conditions will be required in the future.

AB The purpose of this research is deploying a proximal sensing solution using non-invasive and cost-effective sensors onboard an Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) as a feasible way for building high-resolution maps of water potential in vineyards. The final objective is offering growers a practical system to make decisions about water management, especially for arid climatic conditions. The monitoring AGV was entirely developed within this research context, and as a result, it is a machine specifically designed to endure off-road conditions and harsh environments. The autonomous vehicle served as a massive, non-invasive, and on-the-go data collector robotic platform. The sensors used for measuring the relevant field variables were two spectral reflectance sensors (SRS), an infrared radiometer, and an on-board weather sensor. The collected data were displayed on comprehensible grid maps using the Local Tangent Plane (LTP) coordinate system. The proposed model has a coefficient of determination R-2 of 0.69, and results from combining six parameters: the canopy and air temperatures (as the temperature difference), the relative humidity, the altitude difference, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI). The strongest relationships found in this study were between the temperature difference and PRI, with an R-2 of 0.75, and the temperature difference with the leaf water potential with an R-2 of 0.61. The practical use of these high-resolution maps includes irrigation scheduling and harvest zoning for sorting grape quality, with a further use as inputs to complex artificial intelligence algorithms considering larger areas or complementing airborne data. Future improvements to make the models more robust and versatile will entail considering additional variables, locations, or grapevine cultivars, and even other crops grown in vertical trellis systems.

AB The attitudes of the public play a critical role in the acceptance, purchase, utilization, and research and development of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Currently, the attitudes of the public toward AVs have been mostly estimated through traditional survey data, which bears a low quantity of samples with high labor costs. It is probably also one of the reasons why the critical factors on the attitudes of the public toward AVs have not been studied from a comprehensive perspective yet. To address the issue, this study aims to propose a method by using large-scale social media data to investigate key factors that affect the attitudes of the public toward AVs. A total of 954,151 Twitter data related to AVs and 53 candidate independent variables from seven categories were extracted using the web scraping method. Then, sentiment analysis was used to measure the public attitudes towards AVs by calculating sentiment scores. Random forests algorithm was employed to preliminarily select candidate independent variables according to their importance and a linear mixed model was utilized to explore the impacting factors, considering the unobserved heterogeneities caused by the subjectivity level of tweets. The results showed that the attitudes of the public toward AVs were slightly optimistic. Factors, such as "drunk", "blind spot", and "mobility", had the largest impacts on public attitudes. In addition, people were more likely to express positive feelings when talking about words, such as "lidar" and "Tesla", related to high technologies. Conversely, factors, such as "COVID-19", "pedestrian", "sleepy", and "highway", were found to have significantly negative effects on the attitudes of the public. The findings of this study are beneficial for the development of AV technologies, the guidelines for AV-related policy formulation, and the understanding and acceptance of the public toward AVs.

AB For the past few years, the automation of transportation becomes a hot research topic for smart cities. Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) aims to manage and optimize the traffic congestion, road accidents, parking allocation using Autonomous Vehicles (AV) system, where the AVs are internally connected for message passing and critical decision making in time-sensitive applications. The data security in such applications can be offered using Blockchain (BC) technology. But, as per the existing literature, there exists no system which can call AVs automatically based on the situation, i.e., call an ambulance in case of an accident, call logistic service in case of home transfer, and call the traffic department in case of traffic jam. Motivated from the aforementioned reasons, in this article, we propose a BC-based secure and intelligent sensing and tracking architecture for AV system using beyond 5G communication network. Recently, AVs are facing issues with sensing and tracking technology as well as the data thefts. AV system contains sensitive information and transfers it through a communication channel to Connected AVs (CAVs), where the corrupted information or delay of a fraction of a second can lead to a critical situation. So, here we present possib the attacks and safety countermeasures using BC technology to protect the AV system. The proposed architecture ensures secure sensing and tracking of an object through BC by deploying AI algorithms at the edge servers. Also, the beyond 5G network enables communications with low latency and high reliability to meet the desires of the aforementioned time-sensitive applications. The proposed system is evaluated by considering the parameters as mobility and data transfer time against the traditional LTE-A and 5G communication networks. The proposed system outperforms traditional systems and can be suitable for diverse applications where latency, reliability, and security are the prime concerns.

ID DECISION-MAKING
AB Objective: Road testing can accelerate the development and validation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). AV road testing can come with high safety risks, particularly in a complex road traffic environment, due to the immaturity of AV technology. A priori safety risk assessments of the road traffic environment before AV road testing are of great importance, allow the quantifying of risk levels in different road scenarios, and provide guidelines for AV road testing in low to high-risk environments.Methods: This study proposes a framework, namely Safety Risk Assessment for AV road testing (SRAAV), based on the probability and severity of five categories of potential AV accidents. Four groups of influencing factors are considered comprehensively in assessing AV safety risk, and their impacts are quantified using impact coefficients derived from a Bayesian network and empirical AV road testing data. The safety risk is assessed on a road section level, based on which an overall risk level is defined for a corridor and a region. Afterwards, the quantified safety risk is classified into four levels according to expert experience and knowledge, through a questionnaire survey.Results: Applications of the proposed SRAAV framework are conducted for urban roads in Shanghai, and expressways in Shanghai and Gothenburg. The assessment results are validated using disengagement data from AV road testing. The results show that the SRAAV framework and its models could estimate the safety risk levels of road traffic environments for AV road testing in a sound way and have the flexibility for further extensions to be made.Conclusions: The framework and assessment results can provide technical support for determining where and when to grant permission for public roads to be used for AV road testing, and how to choose public roads from a low to a high risk level, guaranteeing the safety of AV public road testing.

AB The introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in the road transportation systems raises questions with respect to their interactions with human drivers', especially during the early stages. Issues such as unfamiliarity or false assumptions regarding the timid and safe behaviour of AVs could potentially result in undesirable human driver behaviours, for instance "testing " AVs or being aggressive towards them. Among other factors, morality has been determined as a source of aggressive driving behaviour. Following previous approaches on moral disengagement, the current paper argues that moral standards during interactions of human drivers with AVs could potentially blur, leading to the disengagement of self-regulation mechanisms of moral behaviour. The study investigates the impact of moral disengagement on the intention of human drivers to be aggressive towards AVs. To that end, an online survey was conducted including a newly developed survey of moral disengagement, adapted to the context of AVs. Moreover, measures of personality, driving style, attitudes towards sharing the road with AVs and perceived threats were collected. A confirmatory factor analysis provided support for the concept of moral disengagement in the context of AVs. Moreover, relationships between personality, driving style and attitudes towards sharing the road with AVs were found, via a structural equation modelling approach (SEM). The results could have implications in the future driver training and education programmes, as it might be necessary to not only focus on driving skills but also on the development of procedural skills that will improve the understanding of AVs' capabilities and ensure safer interactions. Efforts on improving attitudes towards AVs may also be necessary for improving human driver behaviour.

AB Underwater Acoustic Networks are gaining in popularity because of their usage in underwater communication. The communication is facilitated with sensors and AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles), also termed as UWCNs (Underwater Wireless Communication Networks). The QoS expected of underwater networks is effective transmission along with an extended lifespan of the network. This can be achieved with strategically placed clusters underwater which help in transmitting effectively. Clustering can be strategically used to securely transmit the data while conserving the node energy.This paper proposes an Optimal and Energy Efficient Framework for Cluster Communication Based Routing Protocol for UWCNs (OEEFCP).This scheme works in two phases. Phase-1 focuses on selecting an optimal CH (a Robust Cluster Head) which will be responsible for selecting an efficient carrier of data. Additionally, we have used probability in selecting the optimum number of clusters and CHs. Phase-2 uses an effective multipath energy model which will focus on transmitting data through effective communication channels. A RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) value is used to determine a gateway node out of the optimal CHs. The robust gateway nodes thus selected will supply data to the AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles) nearest to them. The AUV nodes will then transfer the data via a communication link and thereon towards a destination on land. The proposed technique focuses on a cost effective solution for underwater transmission. The proposed OEEFCP is analyzed with existing schemes such as OC-TARE-TOPSIS and TARE-TOPSIS protocols, using the NS2 simulator. The analysis confirms that the proposed OEEFCP is capable of achieving a good performance in achieving an extended network lifespan, throughput, energy conservation and a maximized PDR. Our proposed OEEFCP scheme shows a 65% increase in PDR over the other existing methods.

AB The robotics community is increasingly interested in autonomous aerial transportation. Unmanned aerial vehicles with suspended payloads have advantages over other systems, including mechanical simplicity and agility, but pose great challenges in planning and control. To realize fully autonomous aerial transportation, this letter presents a systematic solution to address these difficulties. First, we present a real-time planning method that generates smooth trajectories considering the time-varying shape and non-linear dynamics of the system, ensuring whole-body safety and dynamic feasibility. Additionally, an adaptive NMPC with a hierarchical disturbance compensation strategy is designed to overcome unknown external perturbations and inaccurate model parameters. Extensive experiments show that our method is capable of generating high-quality trajectories online, even in highly constrained environments, and tracking aggressive flight trajectories accurately, even under significant uncertainty. We plan to release our code to benefit the community.

AB In this article, we describe the development process of autonomous navigation capabilities of a small cruise boat operating in a canal environment and present the results of a field experiment conducted in the Pohang Canal, South Korea. Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) was used for the online trajectory planning and tracking control of the cruise boat in a narrow passage in the canal. To consider the nonlinear characteristics of boat dynamics, system identification was performed using experimental data from various test maneuvers, such as acceleration-deceleration and zigzag trials. To efficiently represent the obstacle structures in the canal environment, we parameterized the canal walls as line segments with point cloud data, captured by an onboard LiDAR sensor, and considered them as constraints for obstacle avoidance. The proposed method was implemented in a single NMPC layer, and its real-world performance was verified through experimental runs in the Pohang Canal.

DE Motion planning; autonomous driving; trajectory optimization; path
   planning
AB Lattice-based planning techniques simplify the motion planning problem for autonomous vehicles by limiting available motions to a pre-computed set of primitives. These primitives are combined online to generate complex maneuvers. A set of motion primitives t-span a lattice if, given a real number t >= 1, any configuration in the lattice can be reached via a sequence of motion primitives whose cost is no more than a factor of t from optimal. Computing a minimal t-spanning set balances a trade-off between computed motion quality and motion planning performance. In this work, we formulate this problem for an arbitrary lattice as a mixed integer linear program. We also propose an A*-based algorithm to solve the motion planning problem using these primitives and an algorithm that removes the excessive oscillations from planned motions - a common problem in lattice-based planning. Our method is validated for autonomous driving in both parking lot and highway scenarios.

AB This paper studies a model predictive hybrid tracking control scheme under a multiple harmonics time-varying disturbance observer for a discrete-time dynamics nonholonomic autonomous mobile robot (AMR) with disturbance. To solve the robust tracking control problem of the AMR and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) air-ground cooperative, a hybrid tracking control strategy combined with improved model predictive control (MPC) method is presented. First, a time-varying air-ground cooperative tracking control model based on the nonholonomic constraints AMR and UAV is established by polar coordinate transformation. Second, to estimate disturbances of the time-varying model, a multiple harmonics disturbance observer with time-varying gains is designed. A hybrid tracking control scheme for the AMR based on the estimated states and MPC method with relaxing factor and kinematics constraints is proposed. Finally, experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB During the past years, camera-equipped Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have revolutionized aerial cinematography, allowing easy acquisition of impressive footage. In this context, autonomous functionalities based on machine learning and computer vision modules are gaining ground. During live coverage of outdoor events, an autonomous UAV may visually track and follow a specific target of interest, under a specific desired shot type, mainly adjusted by choosing appropriate focal length and UAV camera trajectory relative to the target. However, the selected UAV camera trajectory and the object tracker requirements (which impose limits on the maximum allowable focal length) affect the range of feasible shot types, thus constraining cinematography planning. Therefore, this paper explores the interplay between cinematography and computer vision in the area of autonomous UAV filming. UAV target-tracking trajectories are formalized and geometrically modeled, so as to analytically compute maximum allowable focal length per scenario, to avoid 2D visual tracker failure. Based on this constraint, formulas for estimating the appropriate focal length to achieve the desired shot type in each situation are extracted, so as to determine shot feasibility. Such rules can be embedded into practical UAV intelligent shooting systems, in order to enhance their robustness by facilitating on-the-fly adjustment of the cinematography plan.

AB Mobility needs, expectations, and concerns vary across age groups and are closely linked to users' views on the future of the road transport system. Automated vehicles are expected to have a significant impact on the future of the road transport system, and pilot deployments are increasingly being tested in Europe and beyond, which is also thanks to the evolving regulatory landscape. As a result, several studies have started to analyse citizens' attitudes towards this technology. However, very few studies have focused on teenagers' views on automated vehicles, although today's children and teenagers could be among the first users of such vehicles. Studying teenagers and the way they envisage automated vehicles in the future is of particular significance in defining transport planning strategies and supporting upcoming policy orientations. To cover this gap, the present study aims to explore teenagers' views about automated vehicles and whether and how they could fit into their future transport setting. A series of on-line and face-to-face focus groups, a demonstration of an automated vehicle prototype, supporting engagement activities, and a post-pre survey were used to collect their views on the topic. The results show that even though the teenagers acknowledged the potential advantages, they also expressed concerns in relation to the interactions with other road users, to automated driving systems' reliability, to safety, and to data privacy. In particular, these safety concerns revealed an unwillingness on the part of the teenagers to be among the first users of automated vehicles.

DT Article
AB Vehicle networking and autonomous driving are hot areas of scientific research today, and they complement each other and play an important role in people's intelligent travel. Intelligent driving vehicle can enhance road safety, effectively reduce traffic flow and fuel consumption, and promote the overall social development. It has great application value in urban traffic system. The traffic condition of a city directly affects the economic development of the city and the improvement of people's quality of life. As the "core" of the urban traffic network, intersections are the frequent places where traffic jams occur. Game theory, as a win-win theory, mainly solves the problem of multiperson and multi-objective with contradictory objective functions and can be used to study the optimal signal control strategy. Aiming at this problem, the potential conflict behaviors of intelligent driving vehicles when turning left at urban intersections are analyzed and a decision model is established. A long-term trajectory prediction model of straight vehicles is established based on the Gaussian process regression model (GPR) considering the vehicle motion pattern. Combined with trajectory prediction, a decision-making process (model) for intelligent driving vehicles based on conflict resolution and a multifactor driving action selection method are proposed. A coordination algorithm based on game theory is designed for conflicting vehicles. The proposed algorithm is verified by the self-developed intelligent vehicle hardware simulation platform. The simulation results show that the PID method based on digital identification and positioning makes the intelligent vehicle obtain good system step response, can improve the disturbance tracking ability of intersection turning analysis, meet the requirements of turning control system, and reduce the complexity and randomness of parameter design, which is better than the traditional fuzzy control method.

AB Dynamic object detection is essential for ensuring safe and reliable autonomous driving. Recently, light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-based object detection has been introduced and shown excellent performance on various benchmarks. Although LiDAR sensors have excellent accuracy in estimating distance, they lack texture or color information and have a lower resolution than conventional cameras. In addition, performance degradation occurs when a LiDAR-based object detection model is applied to different driving environments or when sensors from different LiDAR manufacturers are utilized owing to the domain gap phenomenon. To address these issues, a sensor-fusion-based object detection and classification method is proposed. The proposed method operates in real time, making it suitable for integration into autonomous vehicles. It performs well on our custom dataset and on publicly available datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world road environments. In addition, we will make available a novel three-dimensional moving object detection dataset called ETRI 3D MOD.

AB Deep neural network algorithms have achieved impressive performance in object detection. Real-time evaluation of perception uncertainty from deep neural network algorithms is indispensable for safe driving in autonomous vehicles. More research is required to determine how to assess the effectiveness and uncertainty of perception findings in real-time.This paper proposes a novel real-time evaluation method combining multi-source perception fusion and deep ensemble. The effectiveness of single-frame perception results is evaluated in real-time. Then, the spatial uncertainty of the detected objects and influencing factors are analyzed. Finally, the accuracy of spatial uncertainty is validated with the ground truth in the KITTI dataset. The research results show that the evaluation of perception effectiveness can reach 92% accuracy, and a positive correlation with the ground truth is found for both the uncertainty and the error. The spatial uncertainty is related to the distance and occlusion degree of detected objects.

AB The solar differential rotation results in different velocities on the solar disk. The Doppler velocities of different points on the solar disk observed by the spacecraft are also different, which are functions of the current position of the spacecraft. Thus, using the velocities' information or their differences, the position of the spacecraft can be estimated. The advantage of velocity difference measurement is that the influence of some systematic error, such as the spectrometer error and the periodic variation of the sun's velocity on the navigation performance, can be eliminated. In this article, a new autonomous navigation method using the Doppler velocity differences of different points on the solar disk is proposed. Taking solar explorer as an example, simulations show that the proposed method can effectively restrain systematic errors compared with the traditional Doppler velocity method.

AB Emergent cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) strategies being proposed for platoon formation in the connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) context mostly assume idealized fixed information flow topologies (IFTs) for the platoon, implying guaranteed vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications for the IFT assumed. In reality, V2V communications are unreliable due to failures resulting from communication-related constraints such as interference and information congestion. Since CACC strategies entail continuous information broadcasting, communication failures can occur in congested CAV traffic networks, leading to a platoons IFT varying dynamically. To explicitly factor IFT dynamics and to leverage it to enhance the performance of CACC strategies, this study proposes the idea of dynamically optimizing the IFT for CACC, labeled the CACC-OIFT strategy. Under CACC-OIFT, the vehicles in the platoon cooperatively determine in real-time which vehicles will dynamically deactivate or activate the "send" functionality of their V2V communication devices to generate IFTs that optimize the platoon performance in terms of string stability under the ambient traffic conditions. The CACC-OIFT consists of an IFT optimization model and an adaptive Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller. Given the adaptive PD controller with a two-predecessor-following scheme, and the ambient traffic conditions and the platoon size just before the start of a time period, the IFT optimization model determines the optimal IFT that maximizes the expected string stability in terms of the energy of speed oscillations. This expectation is because each IFT has specific degeneration scenarios whose probabilities are determined by the communication failure probabilities for that time period based on the ambient traffic conditions. The optimal IFT is deployed for that time period, and the adaptive PD controller continuously determines the car-following behaviors of the vehicles based on the unfolding degeneration scenario for each time instant within that period. The effectiveness of the proposed CACC-OIFT is validated through numerical experiments in NS-3 based on NGSIM field data. The results indicate that the proposed CACC-OIFT can significantly enhance the string stability of platoon control in an unreliable V2V communication context, outperforming CACCs with fixed IFTs or with passive adaptive schemes for IFT dynamics.

AB This paper presents a novel system for autonomous, vision-based drone racing combining learned data abstraction, nonlinear filtering, and time-optimal trajectory planning. The system has successfully been deployed at the first autonomous drone racing world championship: the 2019 AlphaPilot Challenge. Contrary to traditional drone racing systems, which only detect the next gate, our approach makes use of any visible gate and takes advantage of multiple, simultaneous gate detections to compensate for drift in the state estimate and build a global map of the gates. The global map and drift-compensated state estimate allow the drone to navigate through the race course even when the gates are not immediately visible and further enable to plan a near time-optimal path through the race course in real time based on approximate drone dynamics. The proposed system has been demonstrated to successfully guide the drone through tight race courses reaching speeds up to 8m/s and ranked second at the 2019 AlphaPilot Challenge.

AB Presently, many researchers and engineers have investigated autonomous driving, which has significantly influenced the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI). One of the critical challenges for autonomous driving is the inadequate precision of autonomous vehicles in detecting pedestrians, which is a major safety hazard tohumanbeings. In this paper, aField Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) demonstration system with a normalizationbased validity index (NbVI) has been proposed for real-time pedestrian detection. The proposed algorithm can accurately detect pedestrians by calculating the Manhattan distance between the target histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) features and real-time pedestrian HOG features. In lieu of sophisticated circuit layout and substantial training burden with neuron computation circuit, the proposed detection system with adaptive features clustering is hardware-friendly and is capable of real-time pedestrian detection using fewer training images with high detection rate (up to 99.2%). Moreover, the function execution time of pedestrian detection is shortened by 25% using FPGA acceleration.

AB A model simulating an autonomous battery electric vehicle system for agricultural field use was created, assuming a 200-ha conventional cereal farm in Swedish conditions. The different subsystems were verified against sources in the literature, field experiments and general common practice. The model was used to compare two different charging systems (conductive charging and battery exchange) for battery electric tractors to each other. A comparative simulation was made with conventional diesel systems (fully autonomous or manned for 10 h d(-1)). The simulation results indicated that battery exchange was generally a faster system than conductive charging. The results also showed that both electric systems were able to achieve similar active time during spring field operations as a corresponding system of a simulated manned diesel tractor for battery sizes from 50 kWh and charge powers from 50 kW.

AB This paper reports on an autonomous ascent by a legged robotic platform in outdoor forested terrain. Two controllers govern the integration of online inertial measurement unit and light detection and ranging sensor signals into commands for climbing by means of an abstracted (unicycle) representation of the platform in support of different performance goals: a kinematic version for endurance and a dynamic version for speed. These control laws, backed by a suite of formal correctness guarantees, encourage a stripped-down sensory suite supporting a simplified world model whose departures from the actual physical environment are handled by the mechanical competence of the legged platform. Both behaviors are implemented on a version of the legged RHex platform, and experiments spanning almost a kilometer (thousands of body lengths) in various challenging settings are conducted.

AB Today, autonomous is often used for technology with a more intelligent self-management capability than common automation. This concept usage is maladaptive, ignoring both the distinction between autonomy and heteronomy according to Kant's categorical imperative and that the meaning of autonomy implies qualities technology cannot have. Being autonomous is about having the right to be wrong, a right justified by accountability and insightful understanding of real-life values, and it is about being externally uncontrollable. The contemporary use of autonomy as well as similar concepts is discussed and a model is presented showing how six sources of confusion interact in a vicious circle that impede human authority and autonomy. Our goal is to sort out these confusions and contribute to a development in which the different roles of machines and people, and human responsibilities, are explicated rather than blurred, which should facilitate the forming of truly beneficial and complementary systems. Practitioner Summary: The maladaptive use of autonomous and similar human concepts for technological systems is discussed in relation to the current situation for human-systems interaction. A model is presented combining six sources of confusion into a vicious circle that predict two problems that lead to reduced human authority.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) recycling in an underwater environment is particularly challenging due to the continuous exploitation of marine resources. AUV recycling via visual technology is the primary method. However, the current visual technology is limited by harsh sea conditions and has problems, such as poor tracking and detection. To solve these problems, we propose a long-term target anti-interference tracking (LTAT) method, which integrates Siamese networks, You Only Look Once (YOLO) networks and online learning ideas. Meanwhile, we propose using the cubature Kalman filter (CKF) for optimization and prediction of the position. We constructed a launch and recovery system (LARS) tracking and capturing the AUV. The system consists of the following parts: First, images are acquired via binocular cameras. Next, the relative position between the AUV and the end of the LARS was estimated based on the pixel positions of the tracking AUV feature points and binocular camera data. Finally, using a discrete proportion integration differentiation (PID) method, the LARS is controlled to capture the moving AUV via a CKF-optimized position. To verify the feasibility of our proposed system, we used the robot operating system (ROS) platform and Gazebo software to simulate the system for experiments and visualization. The experiment demonstrates that in the tracking process when the AUV makes a sinusoidal motion with an amplitude of 0.2 m in the three-dimensional space and the relative distance between the AUV and LARS is no more than 1 m, the estimated position error of the AUV does not exceed 0.03 m. In the capturing process, the final capturing error is about 28 mm. Our results verify that our proposed system has high robustness and accuracy, providing the foundation for future AUV recycling research.

ID VISUAL ODOMETRY; ROVER; MARS; IMPLEMENTATION; ROBUST
AB Mars exploration is expected to remain a focus of the scientific community in the years to come. A Mars rover should be highly autonomous because communication between the rover and the terrestrial operation center is difficult, and because the vehicle should spend as much of its traverse time as possible moving. Autonomous behavior of the rover implies that the vision system provides both a wide view to enable navigation and three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction, and at the same time a close-up view ensuring safety and providing reliable odometry data. The European Space Agency funded project SPAring Robotics Technologies for Autonomous Navigation (SPARTAN) aimed to develop an efficient vision system to cover all such aspects of autonomous exploratory rovers. This paper presents the development of such a system, starting from the requirements up to the testing of the working prototype. The vision system was designed with the intention of being efficient, low-cost, and accurate and to be implemented using custom-designed vectorial processing by means of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). A prototype of the complete vision system was developed, mounted on a basic mobile robot platform, and tested. The results on both real-world Mars-like and long-range simulated data are presented in terms of 3D reconstruction and visual odometry accuracy, as well as execution speed. The developed system is found to fulfill the set requirements.

AB Early fault detection and real-time condition monitoring systems have become quite significant for today's modern industrial systems. In a high volume of manufacturing facilities, fleets of equipment are expected to operate uninterrupted for days or weeks. Any unplanned interruptions to equipment uptime could jeopardize manufacturers' cycle time, capacity, and, most significantly, credibility for their customers. With the help of smart manufacturing technologies, companies have started to develop and integrate fault detection and classification systems where end-to-end constant monitoring of equipment is facilitated, and smart algorithms are adapted for the early generation of fault alarms and classification. This paper proposes a generic real-time fault diagnosis and condition monitoring system utilizing edge artificial intelligence (edge AI) and a data distributor open source middleware platform called FIWARE. The implemented system architecture is flexible and includes interfaces that can be easily expanded for various devices. This work demonstrates it for condition monitoring of autonomous transfer vehicle (ATV) equipment targeting a smart factory use case. The system is verified in a designated industrial model environment in a lab with a single ATV operation. The anomaly conditions of the ATV are diagnosed by a deep learning-based fault diagnosis method performed in the Edge AI unit, and the results are transferred to the data storage via a data pipeline setup. The proposed system's Edge AI solution for the ATV use case provides significant real-time performance. The network bandwidth requirement and total elapsed data transfer time have been reduced by 43 and 37 times, respectively. The proposed system successfully enables real-time monitoring of ATV fault conditions and expands to a fleet of equipment in a real manufacturing facility.

AB The existing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based electric transmission line inspection systems generally adopt manual control and follow the predefined path, which reduces the efficiency and makes a high inspection cost. In this article, a UAV system with advanced embedded processors and binocular visual sensors is developed to generate guidance information from power lines in real-time and achieve automatic transmission line inspection. To realize 3-D autonomous perception of power lines, we first propose an end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract complementary information from multilevel features and detect power lines with different pixel widths and orientations. Specifically, multilevel feature aggregation module fuses multilevel features within the same stage by learning the weight vector related to the content. The joint attention (JA) module is proposed to extract rich semantic information and suppress the background noises. Meanwhile, multistage detection results are fused to enhance the robustness of the proposed network. Subsequently, power lines are grouped according to the morphological characteristics of thinning detection results, and 3-D point sets of power lines are constructed based on the epipolar constraint of binocular images. Finally, the target point of current stereo images is generated by projecting 3-D power line points to the horizontal and vertical planes. The few-waypoint trajectory is generated based on continuous target points, and automatic inspection is finished with the proposed real-time motion planning strategy. Experimental results on four datasets show that the proposed power line detection method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. The developed UAV platform and the proposed autonomous inspection strategy are evaluated in practical environments to validate the robustness and effectiveness.

AB Autonomous driving with active obstacle avoidance in dynamic urban environment has attracted significant attention to improve road safety and traffic efficiency. In this paper, an online optimization-based trajectory planning method for autonomous overtaking is developed to prevent collision and realize safe efficient driving. Unlike traditional methods which solve the overtaking problem with segmented reference path in multi-stages with integer variables, this paper proposes a novel dual-variable trajectory planning framework to get the optimal trajectory for active collision avoidance. First, the nonlinear non-differentiable collision-free constraint between vehicles is reformulated using dual problem optimization. Then, the optimal trajectory for longitudinal and lateral movement is obtained jointly in a receding horizon optimization framework based on the optimized dual variable considering the safety and dynamic performance. The key novelty lies in the reformulation of the nonlinear optimal trajectory planning problem and the formulated whole optimization framework can be solved using efficient open-source solvers for online computation. Simulation studies in different dynamic cases are provided to show the efficiency and robustness for safe driving. The method reaches safe overtaking performance with much less calculation time. Real-world experiment with a static obstacle demonstrates its capability for the safe efficient trajectory planning and online implementation in autonomous driving.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB High-precision and robust localization in GNSS-denied areas is crucial for autonomous vehicles and robots. Most state-of-the-art localization methods are based on simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with a camera or light detection and ranging (LiDAR). However, SLAM will suffer from drift during long-term running without loop closure or prior constraints. Lightweight, high-precision environmental maps have gradually become an indispensable part of future autonomous driving. In order to solve the problem of real-time global localization for autonomous vehicles and robots, we propose a precise and robust LiDAR localization system based on a pre-built, occupied high-definition (HD) map called the Extended QuadTree (EQT) map. It makes use of a planar quadtree for block division and a Z-sequence index structure within the block cells. Then, a four-level occupancy probability cell value model is adopted. It will save about eight times the storage space compared with Google Cartographer, and the EQT map can be extended to store other information. For efficient scan-to-map matching with our specialized EQT map, the Bursa linearized model is used in the Gauss-Newton iteration of our algorithm, which makes the calculation of partial derivatives fast. All the above improvements lead to optimal storage and efficient querying for real-time scan-to-map matching localization. Field tests in an industrial park and road environment prove that positioning accuracy of about 6-13 cm and attitude accuracy of about 0.15 degrees were achieved using a VLP-16 LiDAR. They also show that the method proposed in this paper is significantly better than the NDT method. For the long and narrow environment of an underground mine tunnel, high-resolution maps are also helpful for accurate and robust localization.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) deployed close to the seafloor can acquire high-resolution geophysical data about the topography and shallow stratigraphy of the seabed, yet have had limited application within the fields of glacial geomorphology and ice sheet reconstruction. Here, we present multibeam echo-sounding, side-scan sonar, sub-bottom profiler and High-Resolution Synthetic Aperture Sonar (HISAS) data acquired during three AUV dives on the northeast Antarctic Peninsula continental shelf. These data enable glacial landforms, including mega-scale glacial lineations (MSGLs), grounding-zone wedges (GZWs) and iceberg ploughmarks, to be imaged at a horizontal resolution of a few tens of centimetres, allowing for the identification of subtle morphological features. We map tidal ridges that are interpreted as having been formed 1) along the ice-sheet grounding line by the squeezing up of soft seafloor sediments by vertical motion of the grounding line during tidal cycles, and 2) by the tidally driven motion of grounded or near-grounded icebergs. These data also enable the mapping of small GZWs that show the location of short-term still-stands or re-advances of the ice-sheet grounding zone. No meltwater channels are identified from our data, suggesting that free-flowing meltwater may not be essential for the formation of GZWs or MSGLs. The examples presented here show how high-resolution AUV-derived geophysical data provide a step-change in our ability to image seafloor glacial landforms, enabling new interpretations about past ice dynamics and glacial sedimentation at fine temporal and spatial scales.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), which collect images of marine habitats, are now an established sampling tool. The use of AUVs is becoming more widespread as they offer a non-destructive method to survey substantial spatial areas. The design of AUV surveys has historically been based on expert knowledge and AUV-specific considerations, such as reducing geolocation error. The expert knowledge encompasses intuition, previous surveying experiences and holistic knowledge of the study region.
   We investigate the statistical aspects to AUV survey design for estimation of percentage cover of key benthic biota. We investigate the presence of spatial autocorrelation in AUV data using model-based geostatistics and examine the effect of autocorrelation on survey design by examining different design strategies - methods for placing AUV transects. The design strategies are assessed by inspecting the expected bias and the expected standard deviation of model predictions, where the model depends on the choice of design.
   The AUV data exhibited a wide range of autocorrelation, from non-existent to substantial. The design strategies varied in their statistical performance and nearly all strategies had shortcomings. Design strategies that were consistently poor performers had (i) transects placed in parallel in a single spatial dimension and (ii) made no attempt to spread out the transects in space. The superior design types had more transect-to-transect separation (but not too much) and effectively spanned important covariates.
   The results give guidelines to researchers designing AUV surveys for biological mapping and for monitoring. In particular, we demonstrate that any spatial design should seek spatial balance, such as would be introduced by a systematic or stratified component within a randomized design. Knowledge of the system under study should be incorporated and, if possible, should be done so in a formal manner that is objective and repeatable.

AB In this study we outline the techniques used to transform multibeam acoustic data into spatial layers that can be used for predictive habitat modelling. The results allow us to identify multibeam attributes which may act as potential surrogates for environmental variables that influence biodiversity and define which variables may be reliable for predicting the distribution of species in temperate waters. We explore a method for analysing the spatially coincident multibeam bathymetric and backscatter data from shallow coastal waters to generate spatial data products that relate to the classes derived from fine-scale visual imagery obtained using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Classifications of the multibeam data are performed for substrate, rugosity and sponge cover. Overall classification accuracies for the classes associated with substratum, rugosity and sponge structure were acceptable for biodiversity assessment applications. Accuracies were highest for rugosity classes at 65%, followed by substratum classes at 64% and then sponge structure classes at 57%. Random forest classifiers at a segmentation scale of 30 performed best in classifying substratum and rugosity, while K-nearest neighbour classifiers performed best for sponge structure classes, with no difference in accuracy between scale 30 and 60. Incorporating backscatter variables using segmentation improved the overall accuracy achieved by the best performing model by between 1% (rugosity) and 9% (substratum) above using topographic variables only in the grid-based analyses. Results suggest that image-based backscatter classification show considerable promise for the interpretation of multibeam sonar data for the production of substrate maps. A particular outcome of this research is to provide appropriate and sufficiently fine-scale physical covariates from the multibeam acoustic data to adequately inform models predicting the distribution of biodiversity on benthic reef habitats.

DE Homing; Underwater vehicle; Time difference of arrival; Acoustic

ID SOUND SOURCE LOCALIZATION; TIME; BEARING; RANGE
AB Calling out using sound is a typical means of meeting or knowing where you are with reference to the sound generating source. In acoustic homing, the autonomous vehicle moves to the (home) location where the sound source is placed. This paper attempts to provide a practical solution for acoustic homing of a small-sized autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The AUV maneuvers can be easily decoupled in 2-D motions, yaw, and heave, from the rest of the dynamics. Hence, the steering control law is developed based on a simple idea of following in the direction of 2-D asymptote of hyperbola formed by a Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) measurement. The proposed steering control law is investigated rigorously for 3-D homing. Our main contribution is in designing a simple scheme for steering control substantiated with theoretical analysis, experimental and simulation results. Proposed method orients the AUV in the direction of the acoustic beacon in two stages, coarse and fine, without explicitly localizing the AUV (as in range or bearing based methods) with respect to the home position. The fine steering control law uses TDOA measurements from a single pair of hydrophones avoiding range and bearing computations from measurements. The fine steering is shown to converge the orientation of AUV in the direction towards the location of the acoustic beacon when the initial orientation of AUV is in (-pi/2, +pi/2). The proposed coarse steering law limits the location of the acoustic beacon with respect to the AUV within a region where fine steering is applicable. A placement of sensors is worked out that results in placing the sensors at the corners of a simple rectangular frame. The algorithm is demonstrated using experiments performed on the AUV, Matsya 4.0. Moreover, sensitivity analysis and associated simulation in the Robot Operating System (ROS) demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm against errors in TDOA measurements.

AB The authors investigated the impact of automated driving phases of different durations (long versus short) on take-over performance and driver state. About 30 participants drove on a dynamic simulator under autonomous mode for three successive periods of automated driving: a short (10 min), a long (1 h) and another short (10 min) period, each ending with a take-over request. They performed a non-driving task, watching a film of their choice, throughout the autonomous phases. Driving performance - reaction time and quality - and driver drowsiness were assessed at each take over. About 1 h of automated driving affected the driver's behaviour, leading to poorer take-over performance (longer reaction time and sharper avoidance manoeuvre) and increased drowsiness compared with a shorter autonomous period. Results also suggest that sequencing the autonomous phase in several short periods should improve the driver's take-over performance and help prevent drowsiness. Their findings sound a warning on the risks associated with long phases of automated driving. In particular, they provide evidence that a series of short periods of automated driving is preferable to a long, continuous automated driving phase.

AB Autonomous driving systems (ADS) operate in an environment that is inherently complex. As these systems may execute a task without the permission of a human agent, they raise major safety and responsibility issues. To identify the relevant issues for information systems, we conducted a critical and scoping review of the literature from many disciplines. The innovative methodology we used combines bibliometrics techniques, grounded theory and a critical conceptual framework to analyse the structure and research themes of the field. Our findings show that there are certain ironies in the way in which responsibility for apparently safe autonomous systems is apportioned. These ironies are interconnected and reveal that there remains significant uncertainty and ambiguity regarding the distribution of responsibility between stakeholders. The ironies draw attention to the challenges of safety and responsibility with ADS and possibly other cyber-physical systems in our increasingly digital world. We make seven recommendations related to (1) value sensitive design and system theory approaches; (2) stakeholders' interests and interactions; (3) task allocation; (4) deskilling; (5) controllability; (6) responsibility (moral and legal); (7) trust. We suggest five areas for future IS research on ADS. These areas are related to socio-technical systems, critical research, safety, responsibility and trust.

AB Emerging automation technologies could have a strong impact on the allocation of drivers' attentional resources. The first objective of this pilot study is to investigate the hemodynamic responses evoked to relevant visual stimuli in manual and autonomous driving. The second aim is to examine how the inclusion of a secondary task (attentive listening to a broadcast) modulates these hemodynamic responses in both driving situations. Frontal, temporo-parietal and occipital activations were recorded using a functional Near-InfraRed Spectroscopy (fNIRS) system. Event-related analysis was used to determine whether visual cue processing (specifically, the lighting of a lead vehicle's brake-lights) could induce different brain responses depending on the driving mode and on the presence or absence of a competing task. Mind-wandering as reported by the participants was more pronounced during autonomous compared to manual driving. Our results showed an increase in the OxyHb concentration in the right temporo-parietal and occipital areas during manual compared to autonomous driving, suggesting greater allocation of attentional resources for processing visual cues in the first condition. Finally, an event-related decrease in right frontal activity during autonomous driving when listening was observed, suggesting that attentional resources were more focused on the secondary task than on monitoring the driving scene.

AB With the advent and advancement of connected and automated vehicle technologies, it is now possible to control connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic flows to reduce traffic oscillations and enhance traffic flow performance. Recently, a control strategy for autonomous vehicles (AVs) named "The Follower Stopper controller" (FS) has been proposed. However, the existing studies for the FS strategy only considered the situation that all CAVs execute the FS strategy individually. And the impact on the mixed traffic flow when CAVs in the mixed traffic flow execute FS strategies as platoons is not investigated. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a control strategy for CAVs that considers the driving behavior of CAVs platoons based on the FS strategy, which allows CAVs to execute the FS strategy as a platoon. Then, a cellular automaton model of mixed traffic flow is developed based on the proposed strategy. Finally, a numerical simulation is conducted to analyze the impacts of the proposed strategy on traffic efficiency, traffic congestion, traffic oscillation, vehicle fuel consumption, and pollutant emissions under different penetration rates (PRs) of CAVs and traffic densities. Moreover, a comparative analysis with the FS strategy was conducted to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed strategy. The result shows that (1) the proposed strategy can effectively mitigate traffic oscillations and reduce congestion. The improvement effect of the proposed control strategy on the mixed traffic flow is significantly affected by the penetration rate of CAVs as well as the traffic density. (2) Compared with the FS strategy, the proposed strategy has better performance in improving traffic efficiency, alleviating traffic oscillations, relieving congestion, and reducing fuel consumption and pollutant emissions under different traffic conditions. (3) The effectiveness of the FS strategy in improving the performance of mixed traffic flow is greatly limited by traffic density. There is a significant marginal utility of the FS strategy in improving traffic flow performance under high traffic density. However, the proposed strategy overcomes the limitations imposed by high traffic densities. The proposed strategy is highly adaptable to diverse traffic densities and can continuously enhance traffic flow performance as the penetration rate of CAVs rises.

AB Transplanting seedlings is one of the most important but labor-intensive operations in strawberry cultivation. However, oversized strawberry seedlings, the planting environment of elevated cultivation facilities and the requirement of positioning the arched back outward are unique challenges compared with current transplanters for other plants. First, we investigated the working environment and goal of the transplanter. In this research, a new system was proposed that is completely different from existing transplanters. The main components, including the autonomous vehicle navigated with an arc array of photoelectric switches, the pneumatic rotary dual-gripper unit, the dual-hole punching unit, the grip punch coupled transportation unit, and the easy plug-feeding unit, were developed. Then, the structure and basic control logic of the control system was introduced, and an autonomous control mode with minimal manual intervention was described. In field tests, it was found that the prototype achieved the autonomous transplantation of oversized strawberry seedlings into elevated facilities, ensuring the proper orientation of the arched back. The overall success rate and speed reached 95.3% and 1047.8 plants/h, respectively, and the coefficients of variation of plant distance, row spacing, and row straightness were 4.67%, 6.55% and 5.77%, respectively. The transplanter developed here has good application prospects to replace manual operation.

DT Article
AB It is expected that soon there will be a significant number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating side-by-side with manned civil aircraft in national airspace systems. To be able to integrate UAVs safely with civil traffic, a number of challenges must be overcome first. This study investigates situational awareness of UAVs' autonomous taxiing in an aerodrome environment. The research work is based on a real outdoor experimental data collected at the Walney Island Airport, the UK. It aims to further develop and test UAVs' autonomous taxiing in a challenging outdoor environment. To address various practical issues arising from the outdoor aerodrome such as camera vibration, taxiway feature extraction, and unknown obstacles, the authors develop an integrated approach that combines the Bayesian-network based semantic segmentation with a self-learning method to enhance situational awareness of UAVs. Detailed analysis of the outdoor experimental data shows that the integrated method developed in this study improves the robustness of situational awareness for autonomous taxiing.

AB We propose a novel method of positioning using a high-frequency radio-frequency identification (HF RFID) system for navigating autonomous vehicles when a sparse grid of floor tags is employed. For this, we propose a novel triangular multi-loop-bridge reader antenna which generates an error signal in the form of bridge potential that is a function of the tags' location. The proposed positioning algorithm combines the information from the reader database with the error signals generated by the bridge loop and couples them with any available data from the wheel encoders of an autonomously moving object to deduce its position and orientation. The accuracy and efficacy of the proposed algorithm are evaluated using both simulations and experiments using an autonomous wheelchair. The results indicate that the proposed method offers a significant improvement over existing HF-RFID-based positioning methods for larger floor-tag-grid separation.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Autonomous driving technology heavily depends on accurate and smooth path tracking. Facing complex urban driving scenarios, developing a suite of high-performance and robust parameters for controllers becomes imperative. This paper proposes a stochastic simulation-based optimization model for optimizing the Proportional-Integral-Differential (PID) controller parameters, with tracking accuracy and smoothness as bi-objectives, and solves it using a domination-measure-based efficient global optimization (DMEGO) algorithm. In this model, the tracking accuracy and smoothness are indexed by the normalized dynamic time warping (NDTW) and the mean absolute lateral acceleration (MALA), respectively. In addition, we execute the PID controller in a realistic simulation environment using a CARLA simulator, which consider various city scenes, diverse routes, different vehicle types, road slopes, etc., to provide a comprehensive and reliable evaluation for the designed PID controller. In the DMEGO method, each solution undergoes evaluation using a fixed number of costly simulations. Then, utilizing the solutions and their estimated bi-objective values, two surrogate models for the bi-objectives are constructed using the Gaussian process (GP) model. The preliminary nondominated solutions can be obtained by optimizing the two surrogate models. Finally, a novel performance metric known as the domination measure is employed to evaluate the quality of each solution. This metric is then integrated with the crowding distance to selectively retain a candidate solution exhibiting superior performance and good diversity for the next iteration. In our numerical experiments, we first test the DMEGO algorithm against three other counterparts using a stochastic FON benchmark. The proposed approach is then employed to optimize the PID parameters considering the complexity and uncertainty of urban traffic. The numerical results demonstrate that the nondominated solutions obtained by DMEGO exhibit excellent performance in terms of tracking accuracy and smoothness under limited simulation budgets. Overall, the proposed approach may be a viable tool for solving multi-objective simulation-based optimization problem under uncertainties.

   matrix; overtaking; dynamic graph
AB Automatic overtaking is a challenging task for self-driving vehicles. Traditional rule-based methods for overtaking in autonomous driving heavily rely on many predefined rules and are difficult to apply in complex driving scenarios. Learning-based methods usually use convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and multilayer perceptrons, etc., to extract features from environments, but they fail to effectively represent geometric and interactive information among traffic participants. Classic graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have the ability of represent graph-structural information but are limited to stable relationship representation due to the fixed adjacency matrix when applied in autonomous driving. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic graph learning method based on a graph convolutional network with a trainable adjacency matrix (TAM-GCN) to enable the learning of dynamic relationships among different nodes in an ever-changing driving scene. In addition, we develop a planning method for overtaking strategy in autonomous driving, where the proposed TAM-GCN is used to extract the spatial graph-structural features, select appropriate overtaking time, and generate efficient overtaking actions. The proposed model is trained using the imitation learning method. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both closed-loop and open-loop testing in the CARLA simulator and compare our method with state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method achieves better accuracy, safety and overtaking performance than existing methods.

AB Introduction: Significant progress has been made in the development of autonomous vehicles (AV) in recent years, with an increasing number of trials performed to identify how AVs might function within the existing transport modal choices. With this has come increasing recognition of the multiple benefits that AVs might provide for wider society, not least reduced road congestion and pollution, safer travel, and increased fuel efficiency. Removing the need for a dedicated driver means that costs to use AVs services will be lower; in the case of private AV ownership, the requirement for a driving licence is removed. These attributes are highly advantageous for all passengers, but especially for the disabled community, and in the case of the current project, those with visual impairment. The use of AVs may have significant implications for the independence of this group, impacting on feelings of social and psychological well-being.
   Methods: In the current study, 419 people, both VI and sighted, took part in an AV trial (`Arthur'). Participants' faces (inclusive of guide dogs) were recorded throughout the journey and all participants responded to a questionnaire about their experience during this journey. Recordings were analysed using FACS (Facial Actions Coding System).
   Results: Results from the questionnaire indicated an overall positive experience for participants, and reduced anxiety from the time prior to the journey to the end of the journey. FACS analysis showed happiness as the predominant emotion expressed by passengers; a smaller number expressed surprise or fear, these were mainly identified early during the journey or as the result of an emergency stop.
   Conclusions: The results from both data sets demonstrate that for a sighted or VI individual, travel in an AV is largely a positive experience and individuals who have a VI would benefit from AV services in the future.

AB We address the general problem of multiple target localization and pursuit using measurements of the ranges from the targets to a set of autonomous pursuing vehicles, referred to as trackers. We develop a general framework for targets with models exhibiting uncertainty in the initial state, process, and measurement noise. The main objective is to compute optimal motions for the trackers that maximize the range-based information available for target localization and at the same time yield good target pursuit performance. The solution proposed is rooted in an estimation-theoretical setting that involves the computation of an appropriately defined Bayesian Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). The inverse of the latter yields a posterior Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) on the covariance of the targets' state estimation errors that can be possibly achieved with any estimator. Using the FIM, sufficient conditions on the trackers' motions are derived for the ideal relative geometry between the trackers and the targets for which the range information acquired is maximal. This allows for an intuitive understanding of the types of ideal tracker trajectories. To deal with realistic constraints on the trackers' motions and the requirement that the trackers pursue the targets, we then propose a model predictive control (MPC) framework for optimal tracker motion generation with a view to maximizing the predicted range information for target localization while taking explicitly into account the trackers' dynamics, strict constraints on the trackers' states and inputs, and prior knowledge about the targets' states. The efficacy of the MPC is assessed in simulation through the help of representative examples motivated by operational scenarios involving single and multiple targets and trackers.

AB This article describes the core algorithms of the perception system to be included within an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). This perception system is based on the acoustic data acquired from side scan sonar (SSS). These data should be processed in an efficient time, so that the perception system is able to detect and recognize a predefined target. This detection and recognition outcome is therefore an important piece of knowledge for the AUVs dynamic mission planner (DMP). Effectively, the DMP should propose different trajectories, navigation depths and other parameters that will change the robot's behaviour according to the perception system output. Hence, the time in which to make a decision is critical in order to assure safe robot operation and to acquire good quality data; consequently, the efficiency of the on-line image processing from acoustic data is a key issue.
   Current techniques for acoustic data processing are time and computationally intensive. Hence, it was decided to process data coming from a SSS using a technique that is used for radars, due to its efficiency and its amenability to on-line processing. The engineering problem to solve in this case was underwater pipeline tracking for routine inspections in the off-shore industry. Then, an automatic oil pipeline detection system was developed borrowing techniques from the processing of radar measurements. The radar technique is known as Cell Average - Constant False Alarm Rate (CA - CFAR). With a slight variation of the algorithms underlying this radar technique, which consisted of the previous accumulation of partial sums, a great improvement in computing time and effort was achieved. Finally, a comparison with previous approaches over images acquired with a SSS from a vessel in the Salvador de Bahia bay in Brazil showed the feasibility of using this on-board technique for AUV perception.

ID CURRENT DISTURBANCES; AUV; NAVIGATION; GUIDANCE
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) navigating in complex sea conditions usually require a strong control system to keep the fastness and stability. The nonlinear trajectory tracking control system of a new AUV in complex sea conditions was presented. According to the theory of submarines, the six-DOF kinematic and dynamic models were decomposed into two mutually non-coupled vertical and horizontal plane subsystems. Then, different sliding mode control algorithms were used to study the trajectory tracking control. Because the yaw angle and yaw angle rate rather than the displacement of the new AUV can be measured directly on the horizontal plane, the sliding mode control algorithm combining cross track error method and line of sight method was used to fulfill its high-precision trajectory tracking control in the complex sea conditions. As the vertical displacement of the new AUV can be measured, in order to achieve the tracking of time-varying depth signal, a stable sliding mode controller was designed based on the single-input multi-state system, which took into account the characteristic of the hydroplane and the amplitude and rate constraints of the hydroplane angle. Moreover, the application of dynamic boundary layer can improve the robustness and control accuracy of the system. The computational results show that the designed sliding mode control systems of the horizontal and vertical planes can ensure the trajectory tracking performance and accuracy of the new AUV in complex sea conditions. The impacts of currents and waves on the sliding mode controller of the new AUV were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by comparing the trajectory tracking performance of the new AUV in different sea conditions, which provides an effective theoretical guidance and technical support for the control system design of the new AUV in real complex environment.

AB Objective: Some lane-keeping assist systems in development and production provide autonomous braking and steering to correct unintentional lane drift but otherwise require drivers to fully control their vehicles. The goal of this study was to quantify the proportion of drivers involved in unintentional lane drift crashes who would be unable to regain control of their vehicles to inform the design of such systems.Methods: The NHTSA's National Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Survey collected in-depth, on-scene data for a nationally representative sample of 5,470 U.S. police-reported passenger vehicle crashes during 2005-2007 that occurred between 6 a.m. and midnight and for which emergency medical services were dispatched. The physical states of drivers involved in the 631 lane drift crashes in the sample, which represented 259,034 crashes nationally, were characterized.Results: Thirty-four percent of drivers who crashed because they drifted from their lanes were sleeping or otherwise incapacitated. These drivers would be unlikely to regain full control of their vehicles if an active safety system prevented their initial drift. An additional 13% of these drivers had a nonincapacitating medical issue, blood alcohol concentration (BAC) 0.08%, or other physical factor that may not allow them to regain full vehicle control. When crashes involved serious or fatal injuries, 42% of drivers who drifted were sleeping or otherwise incapacitated, and an additional 14% were impacted by a nonincapacitating medical issue, BAC 0.08%, or other physical factor.Conclusions: Designers of active safety systems that provide autonomous lateral control should consider that a substantial proportion of drivers at risk of lane drift crashes are incapacitated. Systems that provide only transient corrective action may not ultimately prevent lane departure crashes for these drivers, and drivers who do avoid lane drift crashes because of these systems may be at high risk of other types of crashes when they attempt to regain control. Active lane-keeping assist systems may need to be combined with in-vehicle driver monitoring to identify incapacitated drivers and safely remove them from the roadway if the systems are to reach their maximum potential benefit.

AB This paper investigates runtime monitoring of perception systems. Perception is a critical component of high-integrity applications of robotics and autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars. In these applications, failure of perception systems may put human life at risk, and a broad adoption of these technologies requires the development of methodologies to guarantee and monitor safe operation. Despite the paramount importance of perception, currently there is no formal approach for system-level perception monitoring. In this paper, we formalize the problem of runtime fault detection and identification in perception systems and present a framework to model diagnostic information using a diagnostic graph. We then provide a set of deterministic, probabilistic, and learning-based algorithms that use diagnostic graphs to perform fault detection and identification. Moreover, we investigate fundamental limits and provide deterministic and probabilistic guarantees on the fault detection and identification results. We conclude the paper with an extensive experimental evaluation, which recreates several realistic failure modes in the LGSVL open-source autonomous driving simulator, and applies the proposed system monitors to a state-of-the-art autonomous driving software stack (Baidu's Apollo Auto). The results show that the proposed system monitors outperform baselines, have the potential of preventing accidents in realistic autonomous driving scenarios, and incur a negligible computational overhead.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study is the first in the literature to examine the Braess paradox considering parking behavior in the autonomous vehicle (AV) environment, based on which the network design problem for the autonomous transportation system (NDP-ATS) is modeled. First, we introduce the AV commuting pattern considering the self-driving process for the parking purpose. We then illustrate the existence of two distinct Braess paradoxes that can occur in AV traffic networks with regards to parking space addition and network capacity expansion. They show that these two types of "improvement" measures might deteriorate the network system performance in an AV situation. Second, motivated to avoid the deterioration due to the introduced Braess paradoxes, we develop a bi-level programming model for NDP-ATS. The lower-level program addresses the network-equilibrium traffic assignment for AVs. The upper-level program aims to minimize the network-wide travel cost considering both occupied and empty AV trips by selecting the optimal design option accounting for road capacity enhancement and parking facility deployment simultaneously. To solve the developed bi-level model, the simplicial homology global optimization algorithm is employed along with the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and the CPLEX. Finally, the efficacy of the modeling framework is validated through case studies on the Sioux Falls city network and the Anaheim network. The results show that the developed methodology is capable of producing high-quality solutions with respect to savings in system-level travel costs for AV traffic. The results also highlight the impacts of parking fees on the system performance for the optimized network. Additionally, it is found that the two objectives, which minimize the total system travel cost and minimize that for empty AV trips only, are conflicting for certain scenarios. The methodological approach introduced in this work serves as a critical modeling device for infrastructure development and policy assessment for AV traffic.

AB In the real word, the periodic disturbance in traffic flow caused by disrupting maneuvers has a huge impact on the car-following stability. As analyzed in this paper, the asymptotic stability of a car-following model, quantified by the coefficient of dynamic responses, is relatively low at low disturbing frequencies, and gradually increases as the disturbing frequency increases. Fortunately, the development of connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technology and the existing researching works on CAV platoon control have shown great prospect of CAV platooning in the improvement of car-following stability. In order to develop a method to manage the CAV platooning with the explicit purpose of optimizing the car-following stability under periodic disturbance, this study presents an autonomous platoon formation strategy (APFS) for CAV platoon. At certain disturbing frequency, APFS can automatically split a large CAV car-following group into a leading CAV and a number of small CAV platoons, and all CAVs in each platoon follow either the last CAV in the previous platoon or the leading CAV, abiding by the newly designed platoon-based IDM (P-IDM) car-following strategy, so that the overall car-following stability of the CAV group can be optimized. Results of numerical simulations demonstrate that, compared with several existing platoon control strategies, the proposed APFS is capable of significantly enhancing the stability of CAV car-following group, as well as passenger comfort and fuel economy of CAVs, under various types of periodic disturbance. In general, APFS works most effectively when the disturbing frequency is around 0.4 similar to 0.6 rad/s. Therefore, the proposed APFS shows good potentials in mitigating the oscillation in traffic flow due to periodic perturbations and improving the asymptotic stability of CAV car-following groups.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, we introduce the application of Baidu Apollo open platform in a course of control simulation experiments. First of all, to let students have a full understanding of industrial-level autonomous driving systems, the overall architecture of Apollo is introduced from four aspects: hardware platform, software platform, cloud service, and vehicle open platform. Then, we carry out a related course based on the control module of the software platform. The theoretical knowledge part mainly has two contents: one is the principle of controller and trajectory analyzer, which are the main components of the control module; the other is the corresponding code composition structure. The experimental part is to write code on GitHub based on the given questions and tips. Finally, students test the code according to the operation steps of the cloud simulation platform. This course can increase students' interest in autonomous driving and allow them to gain vast knowledge in practical implementations.

ID RUNWAY
AB Autonomous UAV technology is limited in its ability to land safely at distinct airfields that have not been precisely surveyed and where GPS is unavailable. In this paper, we present a multi-sensor system for the automatic landing of fixed-wing UAV. The system is composed of a high precision aircraft controller, a range finder (Lidar) and a vision module used for detection and tracking of runways. The estimation of the position of the fixed-wing UAV is by using Lidar and performs gliding till flaring. Then, a federated extended Kalman filter (EKF) structure is costumed and utilizes the solutions of the IMU, GPS and Lidar as independent measurements to estimate the position of the vehicle. The framework can be used to integrate the vision solutions and enables the estimation to be smooth and robust landing. For taxiing, the neural network is used such that from live video stream from the camera trains the UAV to land precisely along the runway.

AB This paper presents control algorithms enabling autonomous heterogeneous trucks to drive in platoons. Heterogeneous trucks imply that the hardware information (e.g., truck length, break, accelerator, or engine) of a truck may be distinct from that of another truck. A platoon is defined as a collection of trucks where a manually driven truck (leader truck) is followed by several automatically controlled following trucks. This paper is novel in presenting the longitudinal control of a truck platoon, as the trucks move along a curved lane as well as a straight lane. For a lateral maneuver, this paper proposes making every autonomous truck keep following the leader's waypoints while maintaining a designated distance from its predecessor truck. This paper develops both a lateral maneuver and speed control considering a platoon of heterogeneous trucks. The efficiency of the proposed approach is verified using simulations.

AB Aiming at automatic, convenient and non-instrusive motion capture, this paper presents a new generation markerless motion capture technique, the FlyCap system, to capture surface motions of moving characters using multiple autonomous flying cameras (autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs) each integrated with an RGBD video camera). During data capture, three cooperative flying cameras automatically track and follow the moving target who performs large-scale motions in a wide space. We propose a novel non-rigid surface registration method to track and fuse the depth of the three flying cameras for surface motion tracking of the moving target, and simultaneously calculate the pose of each flying camera. We leverage the using of visual-odometry information provided by the UAV platform, and formulate the surface tracking problem in a non-linear objective function that can be linearized and effectively minimized through a Gaussian-Newton method. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the plausible surface and motion reconstruction results.

ID FUZZY; SYSTEMS
AB Successful controller development involves three distinct stages, namely, control law design, code debugging and field test. For Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) applications, the first two stages require special strategies. Since the dynamics of an AUV is highly nonlinear, and the environment that an AUV operates in is noisy with external disturbance that cannot be neglected, a robust control law must be considered in the first stage. The control law design is even more difficult when optimal criteria are also involved. In the second stage, since the software architecture on an AUV is very complicated, debugging the controllers alone without all the software routines running together often can not reveal subtle faults in the controller code. Thorough debugging needs at-sea test, which is costly. Therefore, a platform that can help designers debug and evaluate controller performance before any at-sea experiment is highly desirable. Recently, a 6 Degree of Freedom (DOF) AUV simulation toolbox was developed for the Ocean Explorer (OEX) series AUVs developed at Florida Atlantic University. The simulation toolbox is an ideal platform for controller in-lab debugging and evaluation. This paper first presents a novel robust controller design methodology, named the Sliding Mode Fuzzy Controller (SMFC). It combines sliding mode control and fuzzy logic control to create a robust, easy on-line tunable controller structure. A formal proof of the robustness of the proposed nonlinear sliding mode control is also given. A pitch and a heading controller have been designed with the presented structure and the controller code was tested on the simulation software package as well as at sea. The simulated and at-sea test data are compared. The whole controller design procedure described in this paper clearly demonstrates the advantage of using the simulation toolbox to debug and test the controller in-lab. Moreover, the pitch and heading controller have been used in the real system for more than 2 years, and have also been successfully ported to other types of vehicles without any major modification on the controller parameters. The similarity of the controller performances on different vehicles further demonstrates the robustness of the proposed Sliding Mode Fuzzy Controller. The main contribution of this paper is to provide useful insights into the design and implementation of the proposed control architecture, and its application in AUV control.

AB Recently, there have been many advances in the algorithms required for autonomous navigation in unknown environments, such as mapping, collision avoidance, trajectory planning, and motion control. These components have been integrated into drones with high-end computers and graphics processors. However, further development is required to enable compute-constrained platforms with such autonomous navigation capabilities. To address this issue, in this paper, we present an autonomous navigation framework for reaching a goal in unknown three-dimensional cluttered environments. The framework consists of three main components. The first component is a computationally efficient method for mapping the environment from the disparity measurements obtained from a depth sensor. The second component is a stochastic approach to generate a path to a given goal, taking into account the field of view constraints on the space that is assumed to be safe for navigation. The third method is a fast algorithm for the online generation of motion plans, taking into account the robot's dynamic constraints, model and environmental uncertainty, and disturbances. We provide a qualitative and quantitative comparison with existing reaching a goal and exploration methods, showing the superior performance of our approach. Additionally, we present indoors and outdoors experiments using a robotic platform based on the Intel Ready to Fly drone kit, which represents the implementation, in the most computational constrained platform, of autonomous navigation in unknown cluttered environments demonstrated to date. Open source code is available at: . The video of the experimental results can be found in .

AB This paper proposes a blockchain-based secure and reliable data sharing scheme for autonomous vehicles (AVs). It aims to secure data sharing among AVs. We integrate the fifth-generation (5G) communication network with the proposed blockchain-based scheme to enable ultra-low latency, high reliability, and availability. We have incorporated the edge intelligence nodes (EINs) with blockchain for efficient data processing. We have used a random forest classifier model (RFCM) on the road accidents dataset to predict the accident severity, i.e., fatal, serious, and slight. It is based on road type, light condition, and vehicle movement to be shared among other AVs. We have considered various scenarios and performed the predictive analysis that needs to be secured by using blockchain technology. Results of the study demonstrate the accuracy of RFCM as 93%, the precision of 98%, 97%, and 87% for fatal, serious, and slight categories of accident severity, respectively. The results show that the proposed scheme with RFCM yields better accuracy of 93% than other existing classification algorithms such as Decision tree, Naive Bayes, and AdaBoost. The blockchain-based proposed system has been compared with the traditional approach based on parameters such as network latency, scalability, computation time, delay comparison for node validation, data storage latency, and data storage cost. Obtained results show that the proposed scheme enables the data sharing reliable, secure, and efficient for AVs and outperforms the blockchain and non-blockchain systems in terms of security and efficiency.

AB Securing safe driving for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) continues to be a widespread concern, despite various sophisticated functions delivered by artificial intelligence for in-vehicle devices. Diverse malicious network attacks are ubiquitous, along with the worldwide implementation of the Internet of Vehicles, which exposes a range of reliability and privacy threats for managing data in CAV networks. Combined with the fact that the capability of existing CAVs in handling intensive computation tasks is limited, this implies a need for designing an efficient assessment system to guarantee autonomous driving safety without compromising data security. In this article we propose a novel framework, namely Blockchain-enabled intElligent Safe-driving assessmenT (BEST), which offers a smart and reliable approach for conducting safe driving supervision while protecting vehicular information. Specifically, a promising solution that exploits a long short-term memory model is introduced to assess the safety level of the moving CAVs. Then we investigate how a distributed blockchain obtains adequate trustworthiness and robustness for CAV data by adopting a byzantine fault tolerance-based delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Simulation results demonstrate that our presented BEST gains better data credibility with a higher prediction accuracy for vehicular safety assessment when compared with existing schemes. Finally, we discuss several open challenges that need to be addressed in future CAV networks.

AB Biologically inspired autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) or biomimetic AUVs are made to replicate the structural and physiological features of aquatic species. Thus, incorporation of its design in AUV modelling provides higher efficiency at low speeds and improves maneuverability and controllability. This paper develops a biomimetic AUV design based on structural parameters and physiology of an adult Atlantic Salmon fish and proposes a robust control scheme for propelling the fins. For the biomimetic model design of AUV, a 3D CAD model is developed using the actual parameters of Atlantic Salmon fish. The hydrodynamic analysis is performed to calculate the effect of different angles of fin orientations on the value of drag and lift coefficients. Further, kinematic analysis of the tail propulsion system is carried out using the Denavit Hartenberg convention in the MATLAB (R). Based on the obtained modeling parameters of AUV, a robust sliding mode controller is proposed for tracking the desired tail propulsion response using a DC motor under model uncertainties and disturbances. Moreover, the closed-loop asymptotic stability is also guaranteed through Lyapunov theory, which ensures the convergence of system states to the desired angular movement. Lastly, the proposed algorithm is validated using simulation results with comparative performance analysis to illustrate its efficacy.

AB Multiple vehicles control at an intersection is one of the most challenging scenarios in the vehicle control field due to the high number of constraints. However, regarding the control strategies of an isolated intersection, few studies have considered the longitudinal-lateral dynamics comprehensively. In the approaches that treat the turning curve as a straight line, a longitudinal dynamic model is adopted, while the lateral execution ability is ignored. The ideal decisions that ignore vehicle dynamics are not accurately executed by actual vehicles, as doing so would be futile. In addition, due to the strong coupling and nonlinearity of the longitudinal-lateral dynamics model, the optimization problem is difficult to solve. Therefore, in this paper, a reasonable model, the simplified vehicle dynamics model coupled with longitudinal-lateral dynamics is used to describe longitudinal, lateral, and yaw motions comprehensively. Optimization of the longitudinal and lateral control of each vehicle is realized simultaneously. The multi-objective optimization problem is decomposed and solved by each vehicle utilizing model predictive control (MPC) in a distributed manner. A novel safety constraint interpretive method (SCIM) is proposed to reduce the number of constraints and facilitate the solution by converting the safety constraint. The asymptotic stability of a local closed-loop system is guaranteed by a terminal constraint, and the global feasibility is proven. Finally, a demanding intersection scenario, with comparison between the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) method and Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) method, is carried out in a Processor-in-the-Loop (PiL) test. The results demonstrate that intersection safety is guaranteed with smoother control inputs obtained by the designed distributed method. The control inputs are more suitable for vehicle execution, especially in turning maneuvers.

AB Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) can potentially improve the performance of the transportation system by reducing human errors. This paper investigates the safety impact of CAVs in a mixed traffic with conventional vehicles at intersections. Analyzing real-world AV crashes in California revealed that rear-end crashes at intersections are the dominant crash type. Therefore, to enhance our understanding of the future interactions between human-driven vehicles with CAVs at intersections, a simulation framework was developed to model the mixed traffic environment of Automated Vehicles (AV), cooperative AVs, and conventional human-driven vehicles. In order to model AVs driving behavior, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and cooperative ACC (CACC) models are utilized. Particularly, this study explores system improvements due to automation and connectivity across varying CAV market penetration scenarios. ACC and CACC car following models are used to mimic the behavior of AVs and cooperative AVs. Real-world connected vehicle data are utilized to modify and tune the acceleration/deceleration regimes of the Wiedemann model. Next, the driving volatility concept capturing variability in vehicle speeds was utilized to calibrate the simulation to represent the safety performance of a real-world environment. Two surrogate safety measures are used to evaluate the safety performance of a representative intersection under different market penetration rate of CAVs: the number of longitudinal conflicts and driving volatility. At low levels of ACC market penetration, the safety improvements were found to be marginal, but safety improved substantially with more than 40% ACC penetration. Additional safety improvements can be achieved more quickly through the addition of cooperation and connectivity through CACC. Furthermore, ACC/CACC vehicles were found to improve mobility performance in terms of average speed and travel time at intersections.

AB User trust has been identified as a critical issue that is pivotal to the success of autonomous vehicle (AV) operations where artificial intelligence (AI) is widely adopted. For such integrated AI-based driving systems, one promising way of building user trust is through the concept of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) which requires the AI system to provide the user with the explanations behind each decision it makes. Motivated by both the need to enhance user trust and the promise of novel XAI technology in addressing such need, this paper seeks to enhance trustworthiness in autonomous driving systems through the development of explainable Deep Learning (DL) models. First, the paper casts the decision-making process of the AV system not as a classification task (which is the traditional process) but rather as an image-based language generation (image captioning) task. As such, the proposed approach makes driving decisions by first generating textual descriptions of the driving scenarios, which serve as explanations that humans can understand. To this end, a novel multi-modal DL architecture is proposed to jointly model the correlation between an image (driving scenario) and language (descriptions). It adopts a fully Transformer-based structure and therefore has the potential to perform global attention and imitate effectively, the learning processes of human drivers. The results suggest that the proposed model can and does generate legal and meaningful sentences to describe a given driving scenario, and subsequently to correctly generate appropriate driving decisions in autonomous vehicles (AVs). It is also observed that the proposed model significantly outperforms multiple baseline models in terms of generating both explanations and driving actions. From the end user's perspective, the proposed model can be beneficial in enhancing user trust because it provides the rationale behind an AV's actions. From the AV developer's perspective, the explanations from this explainable system could serve as a "debugging" tool to detect potential weaknesses in the existing system and identify specific directions for improvement.

AB In this paper, we present the USTC FLICAR Dataset, which is dedicated to the development of simultaneous localization and mapping and precise 3D reconstruction of the workspace for heavy-duty autonomous aerial work robots. In recent years, numerous public datasets have played significant roles in the advancement of autonomous cars and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, these two platforms differ from aerial work robots: UAVs are limited in their payload capacity, while cars are restricted to two-dimensional movements. To fill this gap, we create the "Giraffe" mapping robot based on a bucket truck, which is equipped with a variety of well-calibrated and synchronized sensors: four 3D LiDARs, two stereo cameras, two monocular cameras, Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), and a GNSS/INS system. A laser tracker is used to record the millimeter-level ground truth positions. We also make its ground twin, the "Okapi" mapping robot, to gather data for comparison. The proposed dataset extends the typical autonomous driving sensing suite to aerial scenes, demonstrating the potential of combining autonomous driving perception systems with bucket trucks to create a versatile autonomous aerial working platform. Moreover, based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM), we produce the Semantic FLICAR dataset, which provides fine-grained semantic segmentation annotations for multimodal continuous data in both temporal and spatial dimensions. The dataset is available for download at: https://ustc-flicar.github.io/.

AB Autonomous driving vehicles are a kind of typical cyber-physical systems integrating complex interactions between hardware and software components such as collaborative computation, distributed communication, and spatio-clock synchronous control with surrounding traffic environment. They can percept the environment, communicate with surroundings, and react fast enough to control independently. The purpose of autonomous driving emergence is to improve driving safety, reduce environmental pollution, and ease the traffic congestion. However, new features with surrounding open and dynamic environment make systems design and verification becoming more and more complex than ever, such as stochastic communication delay, hardware spontaneous failure distribution, and natively hybrid behaviors described by ordinary differential equations. Spatial and time collision avoidance remains crucial obstacles on the path to becoming ubiquitous and dependable. In this paper, we adopt statistical model checking (SMC) to enlighten possible hazards affected by stochastic and hybrid features in the design phase of autonomous driving systems. In order to provide safety and accountability, we first propose a dedicated multi-lane spatio-clock stochastic specification language (MLSCL) to describe safety invariants and guards in domain-specific autonomous driving systems. Then, we present the semantic mapping rules between MLSCL and UPPAAL SMC models, and design the spatio-clock stochastic and hybrid automata based on MLSCL in order to model inherently stochastic and hybrid behaviors. Finally, we present an illustrative lane-change case study to verify spatio-clock stochastic and hybrid-related properties adopting SMC, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

AB While vehicular ad hoc Networks (VANETs) are relatively well-studied, a number of challenges remain, particularly as autonomous vehicles become more commonplace. For example, devices on a vehicle such as, On-Board Units (OBUs) may have resource constraints which render them incapable of supporting computationally expensive cryptography operations required to achieve various security features. One potential solution is to offload computationally expensive tasks to other nodes in the VANET; however, the dynamic nature of the setup (such as the, mobility of the requesting vehicles and other nodes) compounds the challenge of resource management. In this context, we propose a scheme that uses Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) to achieve data confidentiality in VANETs despite such challenges. Specifically, we build a cluster of vehicles to perform CP-ABE operations without relying on other nodes in the VANET. We use Kubernetes, an open-source container orchestration system, to build vehicle cluster(s) to handle distributed micro-tasks. In this scheme, we use a set of factors that impact the computation operations in cluster vehicle components (i.e., the OBU). Each factor, including the distance between the data owner vehicle and the target vehicle, the duration of each target vehicle in the cluster, and the resource of each vehicle in the cluster, has a weight based on its influence in computational operations. The Euclidean method is used to calculate the weight value for each factor. Based on the final total weight for each vehicle, our approach distributes the tasks between vehicles. We evaluate our results by comparing our approach with the mechanism of Kubernetes for task distribution, which only considers the resources in each vehicle. We also consider several scenarios with varying factors to evaluate their impact on the execution time of CP-ABE on OBUs in addition to using simulations to evaluate the performance of our approach in terms of transmission and propagation overheads for vehicles in the cluster.

AB The autonomous driving algorithm studied in this paper makes a ground vehicle capable of sensing its environment via visual images and moving safely with little or no human input. Due to the limitation of the computing power of end side devices, the autonomous driving algorithm should adopt a lightweight model and have high performance. Conditional imitation learning has been proved an efficient and promising policy for autonomous driving and other applications on end side devices due to its high performance and offline characteristics. In driving scenarios, the images captured in different weathers have different styles, which are influenced by various interference factors, such as illumination, raindrops, etc. These interference factors bring challenges to the perception ability of deep models, thus affecting the decision-making process in autonomous driving. The first contribution of this paper is to investigate the performance gap of driving models under different weather conditions. Following the investigation, we utilise StarGAN-V2 to translate images from source domains into the target clear sunset domain. Based on the images translated by StarGAN-V2, we propose Conditional Imitation Learning with ResNet backbone named Star-CILRS. The proposed method is able to convert an image to multiple styles using only one single model, making our method easier to deploy on end side devices. Visualization results show that Star-CILRS can eliminate some environmental interference factors. Our method outperforms other methods and the success rate values in different tasks are 98%, 74%, and 22%, respectively.

AB In this study, wireless communication technologies used in road and marine traffic are compared and analyzed to develop a collision warning system for small maritime autonomous surface ships based on sufficient testing and technologically advanced wireless access in vehicular environment (WAVE) communication technology. Outstanding communication technologies, such as WAVE, have been used as the core technology for the infrastructural development of an intelligent transport system (ITS) as well as autonomous vehicles in many countries and industries. In WAVE communication, information is transmitted in 100-ms intervals. Therefore, it is feasible to maintain control of ships by fully supplementing the update interval of small automatic identification system (AIS) Class B ships using an autonomous navigation system for small ships, thus establishing a safe autonomous navigation system. Additionally, as information is retransmitted every 0.1 s, such a system can sufficiently handle sudden and unexpected risk situations encountered by small ships such as fishing boats.
   To evaluate the appropriateness of the proposed collision warning system based on WAVE communication, real ship tests were conducted for a comparative analysis using AIS communication-derived results. Based on the real ship test results, calculations were appropriately conducted according to the criteria of collision warning determination when confronting dangerous collision situations. In particular, systems based on AIS were found to often miss collision warnings owing to frequent variations in small ships. However, systems based on WAVE were found to have detected all collision risks.

ID MULTISENSOR FUSION; INTERNET; SYSTEMS
AB Autonomous driving is gradually moving from single-vehicle intelligence to internet of vehicles, where traffic participants can share the traffic flow information perceived by each other. When the sensing technology is combined with the internet of vehicles, a sensor network all over the road can provide a large-scale of traffic flow data, thus providing a basis for building a traffic digital twin model. The digital twin can enable the traffic system not only to use past and present information, but also to predict traffic conditions, providing more effective optimization for autonomous driving and intelligent transportation, so as to make long-term rational planning of the overall traffic state and enhance the level of traffic intelligence. The current mainstream traffic sensors, namely radar and camera, have their own advantages, and the fusion of these two sensors can provide more accurate traffic flow data for the generation of digital twin model. In this paper, an end-to-end digital twin system implementation approach is proposed for highway scenarios. Starting from a paired radar-camera sensing system, a single-site radar-camera fusion framework is proposed, and then using the definition of a unified coordinate system, the traffic flow data between multiple sites is combined to form a dynamic real-time traffic flow digital twin model. The effectiveness of the digital twin building is verified based on the real-world traffic data.

AB Designing a stable and robust flight control system for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is an arduous task. This paper addresses the trajectory tracking control problem of a Ducted Fan UAV (DFUAV) using offset-free Model Predictive Control (MPC) technique in the presence of various uncertainties and external disturbances. The designed strategy aims to ensure adequate flight robustness and stability while overcoming the effects of time delays, parametric uncertainties, and disturbances. The six degrees of freedom DFUAV model is divided into three flight modes based on its airspeed, namely the hover, transition, and cruise mode. The Dryden wind turbulence is applied to the DFUAV in the linear and angular velocity component. Moreover, different uncertainties such as parametric, time delays in state and input, are introduced in translational and rotational components. From the previous work, the Linear Quadratic Tracker with Integrator (LQTI) is used for comparison to corroborate the performance of the designed controller. Simulations are computed to investigate the control performance for the aforementioned modes and different flight phases including the autonomous flight to validate the performance of the designed strategy. Finally, discussions are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the given methodology.

AB Although at present legislation does not allow drivers in a Level 3 autonomous vehicle to engage in a secondary task, there may become a time when it does. Monitoring the behaviour of drivers engaging in various non-driving activities (NDAs) is crucial to decide how well the driver will be able to take over control of the vehicle. One limitation of the commonly used face-based head tracking system, using cameras, is that sufficient features of the face must be visible, which limits the detectable angle of head movement and thereby measurable NDAs, unless multiple cameras are used. This paper proposes a novel orientation sensor based head tracking system that includes twin devices, one of which measures the movement of the vehicle while the other measures the absolute movement of the head. Measurement error in the shaking and nodding axes were less than 0.4 degrees, while error in the rolling axis was less than 2 degrees. Comparison with a camera-based system, through in-house tests and on-road tests, showed that the main advantage of the proposed system is the ability to detect angles larger than 20 degrees in the shaking and nodding axes. Finally, a case study demonstrated that the measurement of the shaking and nodding angles, produced from the proposed system, can effectively characterise the drivers' behaviour while engaged in the NDAs of chatting to a passenger and playing on a smartphone.

AB Satisfying both safety and reachability requirements in dynamic adversarial environments is very challenging, particularly when little or no information about the dynamics and intentions of the adversarial objects is available. Therefore, this article addresses the problem of path planning and control of autonomous vehicles in a dynamic adversarial reach-avoid scenario with two noncooperative vehicles and their competitive objectives: 1) "reaching a target and avoiding the other vehicle" for one of them, called attacker, and 2) "protecting the target and capturing the opponent vehicle" for the other one, called defender. In the proposed solution, first, a discrete version of the problem is formulated and solved using linear temporal logic, temporal games, and mu-calculus to construct winning discrete strategies that guarantee safety and reachability. A comprehensive discussion on the existence, correctness, and complexity analysis of the solution is also provided. Finally, a novel correct-by-design hybrid controller is designed to generate smooth control signals that preserve the satisfaction of safety and reachability.

AB Wild-land fire fighting is a hazardous job. A key task for firefighters is to observe the "fire front" to chart the progress of the fire and areas that will likely spread next. Lack of information of the fire front causes many accidents. Using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to cover wildfire is promising because it can replace humans in hazardous fire tracking and significantly reduce operation costs. In this paper, we propose a distributed control framework designed for a team of UAVs that can closely monitor a wildfire in open space, and precisely track its development. The UAV team, designed for flexible deployment, can effectively avoid in-flight collisions and cooperate well with neighbors. They can maintain a certain height level to the ground for safe flight above fire. Experimental results are conducted to demonstrate the capabilities of the UAV team in covering a spreading wildfire.

AB This paper addresses the problem of a fleet containment under the leader-follower strategy with direct topology. The complete fleet navigation, guidance and control have been designed using adaptive control and the artificial potential field formation-based approach. The framework is developed to control the navigation and formation of a fleet of underwater vehicle-manipulator systems (UVMs). The proposed containment control approach is a distributed cascade control structure composed of a navigation and guidance controller and a tracking controller. For the path tracking control, adaptive is applied to the general equations of motion of the underwater vehicle equipped with a 3 link manipulator owing to its ability to achieve fast and robust adaptation. Potential field like control has been used for navigation and guidance. The objective is to ensure robust formation maintenance while in motion or in a standby position. Simulation results show the performance of the control approach even when subjected to ocean disturbances.

AB In recent years, motor vehicles industry has shown a tendency of replacing electromechanical components by mechatronic systems with intelligent and autonomous properties. The integration of hardware components and implementation of advance control function characterize this replacement. In this paper we have applied the system approach and system engineering methods in the initial phase of vehicle active suspension development. An emphasis has been placed upon the interrelations between computer-aided simulation and other elements of the development process. The benefits of application of active suspension simulation are numerous: reduction of time to market, the new and improved functions of mechatronic components/devices, as well as the increased system reliability. In suspension model development, we used CAD/CAE tools, as well as the multipurpose simulation programs. For simulation, we used the one-quarter vehicle model. The modelling was carried out through the state-space equation, after which we designed the controller for our system. During this, we considered only the digital systems of automatic regulation.

AB Introduction: Automated vehicle (AV) technology is a promising technology for improving the efficiency of traffic operations and reducing emissions. This technology has the potential to eliminate human error and significantly improve highway safety. However, little is known about AV safety issues due to limited crash data and relatively fewer AVs on the roadways. This study provides a comparative analysis between AVs and conventional vehicles on the factors leading to different types of collisions.Method: A Bayesian Network (BN) fitted using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) was used to achieve the study objective. Four years (2017-2020) of AV and conventional vehicle crash data on California roads were used. The AV crash dataset was acquired from the California Department of Motor Vehicles, while conventional vehicle crashes were obtained from the Transportation Injury Mapping System database. A buffer of 50 feet was used to associate each AV crash and conventional vehicle crash; a total of 127 AV crashes and 865 conventional vehicle crashes were used for analysis. Results: Our comparative analysis of the associ-ated features suggests that AVs are 43% more likely to be involved in rear-end crashes. Further, AVs are 16% and 27% less likely to be involved in sideswipe/broadside and other types of collisions (head-on, hit-ting an object, etc.), respectively, when compared to conventional vehicles. The variables associated with the increased likelihood of rear-end collisions for AVs include signalized intersections and lanes with less than 45 mph speed limit.Conclusions: Although AVs are found to improve safety on the road in most types of collisions by limiting human error leading to vehicle crashes, the current state of the technology shows that safety aspects still need improvement.(c) 2022 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd.

DE Autonomous driving; ADAS; computer vision; pedestrians intention
   recognition; cyclists intention recognition
AB Anticipating the intentions of vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians and cyclists is critical for performing safe and comfortable driving maneuvers. This is the case for human driving and, thus, should be taken into account by systems providing any level of driving assistance, from advanced driver assistant systems (ADAS) to fully autonomous vehicles (AVs). In this paper, we show how the latest advances on monocular vision-based human pose estimation, i.e. those relying on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), enable to recognize the intentions of such VRUs. In the case of cyclists, we assume that they follow traffic rules to indicate future maneuvers with arm signals. In the case of pedestrians, no indications can be assumed. Instead, we hypothesize that the walking pattern of a pedestrian allows to determine if he/she has the intention of crossing the road in the path of the ego-vehicle, so that the ego-vehicle must maneuver accordingly (e.g. slowing down or stopping). In this paper, we show how the same methodology can be used for recognizing pedestrians and cyclists' intentions. For pedestrians, we perform experiments on the JAAD dataset. For cyclists, we did not found an analogous dataset, thus, we created our own one by acquiring and annotating videos which we share with the research community. Overall, the proposed pipeline provides new state-of-the-art results on the intention recognition of VRUs.

AB Pervasive applications are revolutionizing the perception that users have towards the environment. Indeed, pervasive applications perform resource-intensive computations over large amounts of stream sensor data collected from multiple sources. This allows applications to provide richer and deep insights into the natural characteristics that govern everything that surrounds us. A key limitation of these applications is that they have high energy footprints, which in turn hampers the quality of experience of users. While cloud and edge computing solutions can be applied to alleviate the problem, these solutions are hard to adopt in existing architecture and far from becoming ubiquitous. Fortunately, cloudlets are becoming portable enough, such that they can be transported and integrated into any environment easily and dynamically. In this article, we investigate how cloudlets can be transported by unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAV)s to provide computation support on the edge. Based on our study, we develop GEESE, a novel UAV-based system that enables the dynamic deployment of an edge computing infrastructure through the cooperation of multiple UAVs carrying cloudlets. By using GEESE, we conduct rigorous experiments to analyze the effort to deliver cloudlets using aerial, ground, and underwater UAVs. Our results indicate that UAVs can work in a cooperative manner to enable edge computing in the wild. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A Planning Control Strategy Based on Dynamic Safer Buffer to Avoid

AB Intelligent traffic control at nonsignalized intersections under a connected and automated vehicle (CAV) environment can reduce traffic congestion, vehicle emissions [e.g., carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NO)], but it is still not safe enough for an unpredictable emergency. For example, an accidental stop or slow down of a vehicle in the conflict area will cause secondary accidents of vehicles from other directions because they do not have enough distance to brake. Such risks have not been given sufficient attention in the literature. This paper proposed a safety guarantee mechanism of intersection control to avoid secondary accidents by adding a safe buffer area outside the conflict area of the intersection. To improve the traffic efficiency of intersections and reduce vehicle emissions under the mechanism, we proposed a heuristic vehicle trajectory planning control strategy based on vehicle kinematics. Three planning principles are applied to generate the microscopic trajectory for each vehicle: (1) the vehicle first decelerates and then accelerates before passing the intersection; (2) try not to change the running state of the vehicle; and (3) the vehicles do not collide with each other. Finally, to further improve efficiency, we proposed the concept of a dynamic safety area, which reduces the delay by self-adjusting the safety area to each vehicle's trajectory. The paper selected three simulation scenarios of road intersections to validate our methodology. The simulation results show that the proposed control method with the safe buffer significantly reduces average vehicle delay and emissions compared to traditional signal control systems. Compared with the fixed buffer, in the dynamic safe buffer scenario, the average vehicle delay can be reduced by 66.94%, the throughput is increased by 18.75%, and CO2 emissions are reduced by 9.9%. The dynamic safe buffer can not only relax the safety concern of a nonsignalized intersection, which is not well addressed in the literature, but also has much better performance than the traditional intersection.

AB As a result of the advances in autonomous navigation technology, ocean based operations with increasing levels of complexity can be undertaken using unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). Presently, the trend of developing USVs is to use multiple USVs as a fleet to carry out single or multiple tasks in a cooperative and coordinated manner. To further support such a deployment, a new intelligent multi-task allocation and path planning algorithm has been proposed in this paper based upon the self-organising map (SOM) and the fast marching method (FMM). To specifically address the two critical issues of energy consumption and communication range, a novel energy coordination scheme as well as a task prioritising method have been proposed to efficiently assign tasks to a multi-USV system. The algorithm has been verified and validated through a number of computer-based simulations and has been proven to work effectively in both simulated and practical maritime environments.

AB Mathematical model of motion of a paraglider in the longitudinal plane is constructed. The vehicle consists of a sail and a gondola. Both bodies are assumed to be perfectly rigid. They are connected by slings which are assumed to be perfectly rigid rods. Thus, the considered model of the paraglider represents one rigid body with three degrees of freedom. An engine, which develops thrust using a propeller, is mounted rigidly on the gondola of the vehicle. The orientation of the thrust vector with respect to the gondola is constant. The steady-state regimes of motion of the paraglider for the constant thrust are found. The law of automatic thrust control for which the flight of the vehicle is stabilized at the given altitude is designed. The domains of asymptotic stability of the paraglider motion at a constant altitude, including with account of delay, are constructed in the plane of the feedback coefficients. In this plane the domains in which a given stability factor is ensured are constructed. Some results of numerical simulation of the flight of the vehicle are presented.

AB The connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) is promised to ease congestion in the future with the rapid development of related technologies in recent years. To explore the characteristics of mixed-traffic flow and the dynamic transmission mechanism, this paper firstly detailed the car-following model of different vehicle types, establishing the fundamental diagram of the mixed-traffic flow through considering the different penetration rates and fleet size of CAV. Secondly, this paper constructed the lane-changing judgment mechanism based on the random utility theory. Finally, the paper proposed a lane-level dynamic cell transmission process, combined with a lane-changing strategy and cell transmission model. The effectiveness and feasibility of the model are verified using simulation analysis. This model makes a systematic, theoretical analysis from the perspective of the internal operation mechanism of traffic flow, and the lane-level traffic strategy provides a theoretical basis for balancing urban lane distribution and intelligent traffic management and control.

AB Speed guidance is a significant application in driver assistance system or driverless automated system. Considering the traditional Pearl model-based trajectory planning, this paper proposes an improved method based on window constraints to enhance the rationality at intersection positions. To solve the problem, where the slopes of traditional time-distance Pearl curve at the two boundaries generate relatively low values and which is not in accordance with the actual situation, a new window constraint is used to guide the vehicle passing through the intersection at a high speed. Regarding the new window constraints, together with the maximum speed, tolerating accelerated speed constraints, and traffic signal length constraints, a multi-variable and single objective optimization improved nonlinear programing scheme is applied to obtain the most comfort trajectory of passengers for speed guidance. Simulation results show that, the proposed method presents better performance in traveling time and trajectory smoothness compared with the traditional method under different initial vehicle speeds at upstream intersections and signal offset cases.

AB This paper systematically investigates pedestrian trajectory prediction through a data-driven stacking fusion approach. Firstly, a novel Attention Mechanism-Long Short-Term Memory Network (Att-LSTM) is presented for pedestrian trajectory prediction, pedestrian heterogeneity and pedestrians-dynamic vehicles interactions are considered. Then, a Modified Social Force Model (MSFM) is developed for pedestrian trajectory prediction. The collision avoidance with conflicting dynamic vehicles and pedestrians, the influence of crosswalk boundary and pedestrian heterogeneity are considered. Finally, a data-driven stacking fusion model based on the Att-LSTM and MSFM is developed, and ridge model is used to prevent model overfitting and enhance model robustness. Moreover, traffic data of an un-signalised crosswalk is collected; the non-measurable parameters are calibrated through the Maximum-Likelihood Estimation. The model evaluation results show that the stacking fusion model performs better than the existing methods, which make it possible for autonomous vehicle to present great feasibility for improving pedestrian safety and traffic efficiency.

AB Recent developments in vehicle automation, connectivity, electro-mobility and ridesharing are expected to transform urban mobility patterns and reshape cities. There is enormous uncertainty about how these technological developments, collectively referred to as the 'technological shift in transportation', may impact cities. This paper examines whether the technological shift in transportation will lead cities on a path to sustainability in five aspects-traffic flow, space use, energy consumption, transit and active mobility and economic affordability-through a review of 34 quantitative studies. We find that these studies backed by analytical and simulation models can provide more precise answers, and their results tend to contradict each other based on starting conditions, modelling methods and other driving factors. These driving factors fall within four categories: technological integration, policy, operations and urban planning. The interaction of these driving forces will determine if the technological shift improves transportation sustainability or is detrimental for the city in the long term.

AB This paper considers the network- and application-level reliabilities for connected vehicles under path loss environments. We derive a probabilistic framework for estimating reliabilities that is applicable with various path loss models. We also build a realistic connected vehicle traffic simulation environment and use it to perform extensive experiments considering semi-urban traffic. The results show that the achievable reliability performances differ significantly with the path loss models considered. For a moderate communication distance between a transmitter and a receiver, with established deterministic and stochastic path loss models, the network-level reliability is around 55%, whereas with the realistic path loss models that consider obstacles and traffic, the reliability falls below 30%. To improve the network- and application-level reliabilities, we propose a feedbackless relaying mechanism that can be deployed on top of IEEE 802.11p, where, the relay vehicle selection is done autonomously. The relaying mechanism improves the network-level and application-level reliabilities by at least 35% for the studied path loss models.

AB Motion planning for mobile vehicles involves the solution of two disparate subproblems: the satisfaction of high-level logical task specifications and the design of low-level vehicle control laws. A hierarchical solution of these two subproblems is efficient, but it may not ensure compatibility between the high-level planner and the constraints that are imposed by the vehicle dynamics. To guarantee such compatibility, we propose a motion-planning framework that is based on a special interaction between these two levels of planning. In particular, we solve a special shortest path problem on a graph at a higher level of planning, and we use a lower level planner to determine the costs of the paths in that graph. The overall approach hinges on two novel ingredients: a graph-search algorithm that operates on sequences of vertices and a lower level planner that ensures consistency between the two levels of hierarchy by providing meaningful costs for the edge transitions of a higher level planner using dynamically feasible, collision-free trajectories.

AB Electronic vehicle dynamics systems are expected to evolve in the future as more and more automobile manufacturers mark fully automated vehicles as their main path of development. State-of-the-art electronic stability control programs aim to limit the vehicle motion within the stable region of the vehicle dynamics, thereby preventing drifting. On the contrary, in this paper, the authors suggest its use as an optimal cornering technique in emergency situations and on certain road conditions. Achieving the automated initiation and stabilization of vehicle drift motion (also known as powerslide) on varying road surfaces means a high level of controllability over the vehicle. This article proposes a novel approach to realize automated vehicle drifting in multiple operation points on different road surfaces. A three-state nonlinear vehicle and tire model was selected for control-oriented purposes. Model predictive control (MPC) was chosen with an online updating strategy to initiate and maintain the drift even in changing conditions. Parameter identification was conducted on a test vehicle. Equilibrium analysis was a key tool to identify steady-state drift states, and successive linearization was used as an updating strategy. The authors show that the proposed controller is capable of initiating and maintaining steady-state drifting. In the first test scenario, the reaching of a single drifting equilibrium point with -27.5 & DEG; sideslip angle and 10 m/s longitudinal speed is presented, which resulted in -20 & DEG; roadwheel angle. In the second demonstration, the setpoints were altered across three different operating points with sideslip angles ranging from -27.5 & DEG; to -35 & DEG;. In the third test case, a wet to dry road transition is presented with 0.8 and 0.95 road grip values, respectively.</p>

AB This paper proposes an improved autonomous emergency braking (AEB) algorithm intended for intelligent vehicle. Featuring a combination with the estimation of road adhesion coefficient, the proposed approach takes into account the performance of electronic hydraulic brake. In order for the accurate yet fast estimate of road ahead adhesion coefficient, the expectation maximization framework is applied depending on the reflectivity of ground extracted by multiple beams lidar in four major steps, which are the rough extraction of ground points based on 3 sigma criterion, the accurate extraction of ground points through principal component analysis (PCA), the main distribution characteristics of ground as extracted using the expectation maximum method (EM) and the estimation of road adhesion coefficient via joint probability. In order to describe the performance of EHB, the response characteristics, as well as the forward and adverse models of both braking pressure and acceleration are obtained. Then, with two typical roads including single homogeneous road and fragment pavement, the safe distance of improved AEB is modeled. To validate the algorithm developed in this paper, various tests have been conducted. According to the test results, the reflectivity of laser point cloud is effective in estimating the road adhesion coefficient. Moreover, considering the performance of EHB system, the improved AEB algorithm is deemed more consistent with the practicalities.

AB The development of intelligent transportation systems requires the availability of both accurate traffic information in real time and a cost-effective solution. In this paper, we describe Street Viewer, a system capable of analyzing the traffic behavior in different scenarios from images taken with an off-the-shelf optical camera. Street Viewer operates in real time on embedded hardware architectures with limited computational resources. The system features a pipelined architecture that, on one side, allows one to exploit multi-threading intensively and, on the other side, allows one to improve the overall accuracy and robustness of the system, since each layer is aimed at refining for the following layers the information it receives as input. Another relevant feature of our approach is that it is self-adaptive. During an initial setup, the application runs in learning mode to build a model of the flow patterns in the observed area. Once the model is stable, the system switches to the on-line mode where the flow model is used to count vehicles traveling on each lane and to produce a traffic information summary. If changes in the flow model are detected, the system switches back autonomously to the learning mode. The accuracy and the robustness of the system are analyzed in the paper through experimental results obtained on several different scenarios and running the system for long periods of time.

AB The development of techniques for lateral and longitudinal control of vehicles has become an important and active research topic in the face of emerging markets for advanced autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) and mobile robots. In this respect there has been much literature published, although not so much on actual performance of such controllers in a practical setting. The primary focus in this paper is on the development and actual implementation of intelligent and stable fuzzy proportional derivative-proportional integral (PD-PI) controllers for steering and speed control of an AGV The AGV used in this study is an electrically powered golf car suitably modified for autonomous navigation and control. The use of fuzzy logic for control law synthesis, among other things, facilitates the incorporation of control heuristics, while guaranteeing stability, uncoupling steering control from speed control, and providing for easy incorporation of a braking controller. Through experimentation, the designed controllers are demonstrated to be insensitive to parametric uncertainty, load and parameter fluctuations and most importantly amenable to real-time implementation. The performance of the proposed uncoupled direct fuzzy PD/PI control schemes for the particular outdoor AGV is also compared against conventional proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed fuzzy logic controllers, which are synthesized from a variable structure systems view point, also outperform conventional PID schemes, particularly in tracking accuracy, steady-state error, control chatter, and robustness.

AB In most modern cities, traffic congestion is one of the most salient societal challenges. Past research has shown that inserting a limited number of autonomous vehicles (AVs) within the traffic flow, with driving policies learned specifically for the purpose of reducing congestion, can significantly improve traffic conditions. However, to date, these AV policies have generally been evaluated under the same limited conditions under which they were trained. On the other hand, to be considered for practical deployment, they must be robust to a wide variety of traffic conditions. This article establishes for the first time that a multiagent driving policy can be trained in such a way that it generalizes to different traffic flows, AV penetration, and road geometries, including on multilane roads. Inspired by our successful results in a high-fidelity microsimulation, this article further contributes a novel extension of the well-known cell transmission model (CTM) that, unlike the past CTMs, is suitable for modeling congestion in traffic networks, and is thus suitable for studying congestion reduction policies such as those considered in this article.

AB Vehicle Trajectory Prediction (VTP) is one of the key issues in the field of autonomous driving. In recent years, more researchers have tried applying Deep Learning methods and techniques to VTP tasks. However, due to the black-box nature of Deep Learning, it cannot meet the interpretability and safety requirements of autonomous driving systems. Researchers have tried alleviating this problem by introducing driving knowledge in Deep Learning-based VTP. From the perspective of introducing driving knowledge, this paper systematically investigates the research status of DL-based VTP. First of all, this paper summarizes the research on VTP under three different problem formulations; secondly, this paper summarizes the application methods and application stages of driving knowledge in DL-based VTP; finally, this paper investigates and analyzes the VTP datasets and evaluation, and summarizes the knowledge contained in the datasets and its usage. Through the investigation and summary of problem formulation, knowledge usage, datasets, and evaluation of DL-based VTP, this paper analyzes the challenges and open questions of existing VTP research. It puts forward an outlook on future research directions.

AB This brief disposes the finite-time anti-unwinding trajectory tracking control problem of the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) encountering model uncertainties, ocean disturbances and actuator failures. Primarily, the kinematic model of translational and rotational motions is depicted by unit quaternion in lieu of classical Euler angle such that the AUV's dynamics could be globally and uniquely formulated. Subsequently, two finite-time control strategies are presented here to leave the state variables of AUV can converge to an adjustable region. Additionally, the adaptive laws could be applicable to the existence of actuator faults by utilizing a passive fault-tolerant technology. By integrating the initial value of the scalar quaternion into the sliding mode surface, the proposed controllers are characterized with anti-unwinding property. Then, with the application of hyperbolic tangent function, finite-time stability will be achieved for tracking errors without singularity. Stability of the closed-loop system is verified via the Lyapunov theorem. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controllers. (c) 2022 ISA.

AB The lightweight design of the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is a means to improve its resistance. In order to meet reliability requirements of AUV, the lightweight optimization design of aft pressure shell (APS) with sandwich structure is studied. A multi-objective optimization mathematical model is established for the mass and maximum stress as objectives and the strength as constraint condition, which is efficiently adopted by NSGA-II based on Kriging surrogate model. In the reliability analysis, the statistical distributions of the yield strength and the maximum stress is obtained according to the random variable sample and finite element method and then the stress-strength interference model is established. The result shows that the APS with sandwich structure meets the strength requirements and the maximum stress appears near outer skin. The thickness of the sandwich structure has a great influence on the mass and maximum stress. The reliability index of the optimized APS is 5.02, which satisfies three sigma level of random variables and ensures safety and reliability of AUV. The analysis provides reference and technical support for lightweight of pressure shell.

AB An Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is an underactuated mobile robotic system. This paper is focused on the control of an AUV, which is an interesting problem in robotics. In engineering applications, achieving a precise mathematical model for a given system is not realistic due to the existence of many unknown and unpredictable phenomena in real systems. Therefore, less reliant algorithms on the system mathematical equations are certainly preferable. To this end, first, the mathematical model of the AUV is presented. Then, the desired signals for the control algorithm are produced. After that, a nonlinear PID-based kinematic control is proposed to solve the trajectory tracking problem for the AUV. Subsequently, a Lyapunov-based dynamic control is designed for system actuator torques. In contrast to many existing solutions, control formulation does not require any model transformation or approximation and it is formulated in the original configuration space of the system. The proposed control law is simple, with an explainable mechanism and straightforward tuning, and it leads to the non-oscillatory robot motions in the Cartesian space.

ID SELECTION
AB As more robots, such as autonomous vehicles, are deployed in life-critical situations it is imperative to consider safety, and in particular, localization safety. While it would be ideal to guarantee localization safety without having to modify the environment, this is not always possible and one may have to add landmarks or active beacons for landmark-based localization. As such, this work introduces a method to identify the minimum places in an environment where landmarks can be added to ensure localization safety, as quantified using integrity risk, the probability of undetected sensor errors causing localization failure while accounting for measurement faults. The letter formulates the problem as a systematic minimization: given the robot's trajectory and the current landmark map, add the minimum number of new landmarks such that the integrity risk along the trajectory is below a given safety threshold. The letter proposes three algorithms: a naive approach, Integrity-based Landmark Generator (I-LaG), and Fast I-LaG. The computationally expensive naive algorithm serves as a reference to illustrate simple scenarios. I-LaG adds relatively fewer landmarks than the Fast I-Lag algorithm but is more computationally expensive. Simulation and experimental results validate the proposed algorithms.

The U.S. Navy deploys AUVs in locations around the world that must be charged manually, decreasing their operational endurance and creating operational limitations. Ocean waves are a potential power source that can be converted into electricity using a WEC and stored using a battery. It would be beneficial to develop a WEC that could autonomously charge AUVs offshore. Numerous locations were analyzed to determine the minimum size of a WEC capable of providing sufficient charging power and offering a strategic advantage. By predicting the WEC efficiency (based on empirical equations) and wave resource (based on available data), electrical power generation across numerous WEC types and locations was compared in MATLAB. The generalized process developed here could be used to determine the required size and type of WECs to charge a fleet of AUVs in different locations around the world.

TI Toward Efficient Content Delivery for Automated Driving Services: An

SO IEEE NETWORK

DT Article
ID NETWORKING
AB Automated driving is coming with enormous potential for safer, more convenient, and more efficient transportation systems. Besides onboard sensing, autonomous vehicles can also access various cloud services such as high definition maps and dynamic path planning through cellular networks to precisely understand the real-time driving environments. However, these automated driving services, which have large content volume, are time-varying, location-dependent, and delay-constrained. Therefore, cellular networks will face the challenge of meeting this extreme performance demand. To cope with the challenge, by leveraging the emerging mobile edge computing technique, in this article, we first propose a two-level edge computing architecture for automated driving services in order to make full use of the intelligence at the wireless edge (i.e., base stations and autonomous vehicles) for coordinated content delivery. We then investigate the research challenges of wireless edge caching and vehicular content sharing. Finally, we propose potential solutions to these challenges and evaluate them using real and synthetic traces. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solutions can significantly reduce the backhaul and wireless bottlenecks of cellular networks while ensuring the quality of automated driving services.

AB This study proposes a feedback-based platoon control protocol for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) under different network topologies of initial states. In particularly, algebraic graph theory is used to describe the network topology. Then, the leader-follower approach is used to model the interactions between CAVs. In addition, feedback-based protocol is designed to control the platoon considering the longitudinal and lateral gaps simultaneously as well as different network topologies. The stability and consensus of the vehicular platoon is analyzed using the Lyapunov technique. Effects of different network topologies of initial states on convergence time and robustness of platoon control are investigated. Results from numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol with respect to the position and velocity consensus in terms of the convergence time and robustness. Also, the findings of this study illustrate the convergence time of the control protocol is associated with the initial states, while the robustness is not affected by the initial states significantly.

AB Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been successfully applied to learn policies for safety-critical systems with unknown model dynamics in simulation. DRL controllers though optimal in terms of reward, do not provide any safety and stability guarantees. With reliance on model information, safety conditions can be expressed as Control Barrier Functions (CBF's) and performance objectives can be expressed as Control Lyapunov Functions (CLF's) for real-time optimization-based controllers. In this work, we use an amalgamation of model-free RL and model-based controllers to establish safety and stability. We first design CLF, CBF Quadratic Programs (QP's) for different driving manoeuvres on nominal vehicle dynamics. Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are trained to learn policies for the actual vehicle with enhanced dynamics. In order to incorporate safety and stability while retaining optimal behaviour we selectively guide the RL agents using CLF, CBF QP's. This results in both safe and stable ((SRL)-R-2) policies. We empirically validate the proposed methodology on different driving manoeuvres.

AB Constant monitoring of driving conditions and observation of the surrounding area are essential for achieving reliable, high-quality autonomous driving. This requires more reliable sensors and actuators, as there is always the potential that sensors and actuators will fail under real-world conditions. The sensitive condition-monitoring methods of sensors and actuators should be used to improve the reliability of the sensors and actuators. They should be able to detect and isolate the abnormal situations of faulty sensors and actuators. In this paper, a developed model-based method for condition monitoring of the sensors and actuators in an electric vehicle is presented that can determine whether a sensor has a fault and further reconfigure the sensor signal, as well as detect the abnormal behavior of the actuators with the reconfigured sensor signals. Through the simulation data obtained by the vehicle model in complex road conditions, it is proved that the method is effective for the state detection of sensors and actuators.

AB An Immersion and Invariance [I & I] controller is designed to control the nonlinear lateral vehicle's motion, using the steering angle as the only input. Similar to most of the lateral vehicle's dynamics control law, the cornering stiffness parameters are involved in our proposed controller. Because of the tight relation between tire/road properties and the cornering stiffness parameters, they are not available from the outputs of the sensors and therefore, should be estimated for utilizing in the control law. An online data-driven identification is employed for estimating the cornering stiffness parameters. In addition, a robust model-based fault detection and approximation method in the presence of uncertainties via neural networks is presented. The performance of the obtained control law is investigated via simulation tests in different situations and in the presence of the disturbance. Moreover, some validation tests are performed using the CarSim software to show the effectiveness of our algorithm. (C) 2021 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Previous surveys of people's attitudes toward automated vehicles (AVs) and transit integration have primarily taken place in large urban areas. AV-transit integration also has a great potential in small urban areas. This paper is based on a survey of people's attitudes towards AV-transit integration carried out in two small urban areas in the US State of Wisconsin. A total of 266 finished responses were analyzed using text mining, factor analysis, and regression analysis. Results show that respondents know about AVs and driving assistance technologies and welcome AV-transit integration but are unsure about its potential impacts. Technology-savvy respondents were more positive but had more concerns about AV-transit integration than others. Respondents who enjoyed driving were not necessarily against transit, as they were more positive about AV-transit integration and were more willing to use automated buses than those who did not enjoy driving as much. Transit users were more positive toward AV-transit integration than non-transit users.

AB Autonomous decision-making in unmanned aerial vehicle (UVA) confrontations presents challenges in making optimal strategy. Therefore, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been adopted to address these issues. However, existing DRL decision-making models suffer from poor situational awareness and inability to distinguish between different intentions. Therefore, a multi-intent autonomous decision-making is proposed in this paper. First, three typical intentions are designed comprising head-on attacking, pursuing and fleeing to derive decision models representing different intentions. Reinforcement learning based air combat game model is constructed with different intentions, which contains designing reward functions for intentions to deal with the problem of sparse rewards. Then, we propose the Temporal Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO) algorithm, which optimizes the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm by integrating the long short-term memory network and feedforward neural network. This algorithm extracts the historical temporal information to enhance situational awareness. In addition, a basic-confrontation progressive training method is proposed to provide intention guidance and increase training diversity, which can improve learning efficiency and intelligent decision-making capability. Finally, experiments in our constructed UAV confrontation environment demonstrate that the proposed intentional decision models exhibit good performance in stability and learning efficiency, achieving high rewards, win rates, and low steps. Specifically, our autonomous decision-making increases win rate by 26% when head-on attacking and learning efficiency by 50% when pursuing. It is further proof of the potential and value of our multi-intent autonomous decision-making applications.

AB This paper presents a framework for generating explicit quintic polynomial curves as the trajectory of autonomous vehicles. The method is called SCR-Normalize and is founded on two novel ideas. The first concept is to rotate the coordinate reference, regarding the boundary conditions, in order to reach a special coordinate reference called Secondary Coordinate Reference (SCR). In the SCR, the explicit quintic polynomial curve has short length and low curvature values (i.e. the curve is not wiggly). The second concept is to normalize the trajectory in order to speed up the framework. Two kinds of problems are considered to be solved in this paper: (a) generating a length optimal trajectory for arbitrary boundary conditions subject to a curvature constraint; and (b) path smoothing. For case (a), for the lane change manoeuvre, the problem is solved explicitly. In addition, the familiar expression for the optimal interval of the lane change manoeuvre is analytically proved for the first time. For arbitrary swerving manoeuvres, two algorithms are presented and their performance is compared with each other and with two other algorithms. Similarly, for case (b), an algorithm is presented and its performance is compared with three other methods. Evaluating the algorithms in the examples, and comparing the results with other methods illustrates the efficiency of the SCR-Normalize framework to generate optimal trajectories in real time.

AB This paper presents a novel three-dimensional autonomous entry guidance for relatively high lift-to-drag ratio vehicles satisfying geographic constraints and other path constraints. The guidance is composed of onboard trajectory planning and robust trajectory tracking. For trajectory planning, a longitudinal sub-planner is introduced to generate a feasible drag-versus-energy profile by using the interpolation between upper boundary and lower boundary of entry corridor to get the desired trajectory length. The associated magnitude of the bank angle can be specified by drag profile, while the sign of bank angle is determined by lateral sub-planner. Two-reverse mode is utilized to satisfy waypoint constraints and dynamic heading error corridor is utilized to satisfy no-fly zone constraints. The longitudinal and lateral sub-planners are iteratively employed until all of the path constraints are satisfied. For trajectory tracking, a novel tracking law based on the active disturbance rejection control is introduced. Finally, adaptability tests and Monte Carlo simulations of the entry guidance approach are performed. Results show that the proposed entry guidance approach can adapt to different entry missions and is able to make the vehicle reach the prescribed target point precisely in spite of geographic constraints.

AB Gravity-aided inertial navigation system (INS) has been widely applied in the application of autonomous underwater vehicle. Due to the uneven distribution of the gravitational field, the matching performance varies unsteadily when underwater vehicles pass through real marine environment. In this article, a filtered marine map-matching method based on sliding window iterated closest contour point (ICCP) algorithm is proposed. The filtered marine-map records the information of the contour line, which is extracted from the gravity anomaly value. The trajectory can be represented by different vectors between the contour lines corresponding to the sampled gravity points. In addition, a model-free matching area selection method is proposed. A multilayer support vector classifier is established by hierarchical classification method. The genetic algorithm is adopted to optimize the penalty factor and kernel function parameters. The marine experimental results indicate that the proposed matching area selection method can fully excavate the gravity information and provide directional guidance. The proposed filtered marine map-matching algorithm effectively improved the matching accuracy for underwater vehicles.

AB Seagliders are buoyancy-driven autonomous underwater vehicles whose subsurface position estimates are typically derived from velocities inferred using a flight model. We present a method for computing velocities and positions during the different phases typically encountered during a dive-climb profile based on a buoyancy-driven flight model. We compare these predictions to observations gathered from a Seaglider deployment on the acoustic tracking range in Dabob Bay (200 m depth, mean vehicle speeds similar to 30 cm s(-1)), permitting us to bound the position accuracy estimates and understand sources of various errors. We improve position accuracy estimates during long vehicle accelerations by numerically integrating the flight model's fundamental momentum-balance equations. Overall, based on an automated estimation of flight-model parameters, we confirm previous work that predicted vehicle velocities in the dominant dive and climb phases are accurate to <1 cm s(-1), which bounds the accumulated position error in time. However, in this energetic tidal basin, position error also accumulates due to unresolved depth-dependent flow superimposed upon an inferred depth-averaged current.

DE TMAUV; position tracking control; adaptive control; backstepping method
ID SLIDING-MODE CONTROL
AB This paper presents a robust position tracking control scheme for underwater vehicles moving in a vertical plane. The idea comes from the demand of underwater position tracking control for the newly borne Trans-media Aerial Underwater Vehicle (TMAUV). Although position control of a TMAUV is still within the scope of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) control, it has new features. An underwater reference path for the TMAUV could be characterized by a strong maneuver that many assumptions in the conventional AUV controller design could not be employed. In this paper, a Lyapunov-based backstepping controller is developed for a nonlinear coupled input system releasing all constraints on the pitch angle, heave velocity, and angular velocity. Furthermore, neural networks and parameter estimation are employed to develop a robust controller in the presence of model uncertainties, parameter uncertainties, and external disturbances. This paper also solves the problem of adaptive estimation for the system parameters under the coupled input condition. Simulations are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness.

AB In this study, an automatic tuning approach for attitude control system of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is proposed. The main advantage of this approach is that it can be performed on systems with unstable or critically stable open-loop poles and since UAVs are integrating systems, the method is particularly suitable for this application. A closed-loop relay feedback experiment is conducted to identify the system's open-loop frequency response. The time delay plus integrator models of both inner and outer loops are then identified. The controller's parameters are calculated based on specified gain and phase margins. Wind tunnel experimental results are used to validate the closed-loop performance of a fixed-wing UAV tuned with the proposed methodology.

AB The propagation of visible light underwater suffers rapid attenuation and extreme scattering. This, in combination with the limited camera-to-light separation available on most imaging platforms, places severe limitations on our ability to optically image large areas of the sea floor at high resolution. In this paper, we present a general framework for mosaicking large areas underwater with a specific emphasis on the issues that are unique to the underwater environment. At the individual image level, we examine the role of attenuation, scattering, and camera to light separation and present the tradeoffs involved in optimizing a particular imaging geometry. We also examine the arbitrary image-registration problem in the face of conditions prevalent underwater, namely a moving nonuniform lighting source and the effects of a featureless unstructured terrain. Our analysis is based on photomosaics encompassing several hundred images on archaeological, forensic, and geological expeditions from a diverse set of imaging platforms, including the NR-1 nuclear submarine, the manned submersible Alvin, the Argo towed vehicle, the Jason remotely operated vehicle, and the ABE autonomous underwater vehicle.

AB This article discusses a control problem of underactuated autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) subject to internal/external uncertainties, input saturations, and actuator faults, and proposes a novel event-triggered adaptive PID fault-tolerant (ETAPID-FT) control solution. To resolve the design difficulty caused by the underactuated feature, a standard multivariate integral cascade form regarding the mathematical model of underactuated ASVs is established. And then, to facilitate the implementation of PID-based design framework, the nonsmooth actuator saturation nonlinearity caused by the saturation constraint is represented by a smooth saturation model. In the control design, considering full features of the actuator fault and smooth function, an indirect neural approximation with single-parameter-leaning technique is developed, which endows the function of self-tuning control gain for the control solution. To relieve the mechanical wear of actuator, an improved event-triggered protocol by implanting a decreasing function of ASV's position error is proposed. Moreover, the theoretical results show that the proposed ETAPID-FT control solution can guarantee the boundedness of all the signals in the closed-loop control system of underactuated ASVs. Finally, the validity of the developed control solution is confirmed by the simulation and comparative results

AB With the unprecedented development of deep learning, autonomous vehicles (AVs) have achieved tremendous progress nowadays. However, AV supported by DNN models is vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, hindering the large-scale application of autonomous driving. For example, by injecting carefully designed poisons into the training dataset of the DNN model in the traffic sign recognition system, the attacker can mislead the system to make targeted misclassification or cause a reduction in model classification accuracy. In this article, we conduct a thorough investigation of the state-of-the-art data poisoning attacks and defenses against AVs. According to whether the attacker needs to manipulate the data labeling process, we divide the state-of-the-art attack approaches into two categories, i.e., dirty-label attacks and clean-label attacks. We also differentiate the existing defense methods into two categories based on whether to modify the training data or the models, i.e., data-based defenses and model-based defenses. In addition to a detailed review of attacks and defenses in each category, we also give a qualitative comparison of the existing attacks and defenses. Besides, we provide a quantitative comparison of the existing attack and defense methods through experiments. Last but not least, we pinpoint several future directions for data poisoning attacks and defenses in AVs, providing possible ways for further research.

AB Increasing accessibility and balancing its distribution across space and social groups are two fundamental goals to make transport more sustainable and equitable. In the next decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs) could significantly transform the transport system, influencing accessibility and transport equity. In particular, depending on the assumed features of AVs (e.g., private or collective) and the considered spatial, social, and regulative context (e.g., rural or urban areas), impacts may be very different. Nevertheless, research in this field is still limited, and the relationship between AV assumptions and accessibility impacts is still partially unclear. This paper aims to provide a framework of the key and emerging aspects related to the implications of AVs for accessibility and transport equity. To set this framework, we perform an analysis of the scientific literature based on a conceptual model describing the implications of AVs for the distribution of accessibility across space and social groups. We recognize four main expected impacts of AVs on accessibility: (1) accessibility polarization, (2) accessibility sprawl, (3) exacerbation of social accessibility inequities, and (4) alleviation of social accessibility inequities. These impacts are described and analyzed in relation to the main AV assumptions expected to trigger them through different mechanisms. Based on the results, some recommendations for future studies intending to focus on the relation between AVs, accessibility, and transport equity are provided.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are supposed to make appropriate strategies to ensure driving safety and improve traffic efficiency. However, not all collisions will be avoidable. In a typical dilemma scenario of this paper, we have to make hard decisions from two evils, sparing a child with red-light running behavior or crashing into a well-equipped motorcycle driver without violation of the traffic law. Combined with the existing traffic laws and the accident liability judgment cases in China, 12 typical dilemma scenarios are established. In order to acquire data to analyze the driving decision-making factors involving ethics and legal under the moral dilemma of AVs, we conduct a series of experiments in virtual reality environments. Furthermore, key factors are extracted to characterize the driving decisions under different scenarios and quantified by the gray relation entropy analysis method. Particularly, the ethical factor is represented by the quantity and type of collision targets, the legal factor is qualified by rights of way. The results showed that priority levels of the influencing factors in each moral dilemma were considerably different. Nevertheless, when the quantity of collision targets on two sides is equal, more participants prefer to protect the ones that comply with traffic rules. The research results can provide the basis for designing moral algorithms for the AVs.

TI Factors to Evaluate Capability of Map for Vehicle Localization

DE Autonomous vehicles self-localization; scan matching; normal

ID SLAM; REGISTRATION
AB Recently, autonomous vehicle's self-localization based on the matching of laser scanner data to the high definition (HD) map become more popular due to the availability of HD map and price down of light detection and ranging technologies. Many types of research have been done to achieve locally and globally accurate HD map for accurate localization. However, the global accuracy of the map does not guarantee accurate self-localization within the map. To achieve accurate self-localization, the map should satisfy some requirements. In this paper, the focus is made on the map, as one of the high potential sources of error in localization. By investigating the erroneous scenarios in the map and comparing their characteristics, we introduced four criteria for the self-localization ability of the map. These criteria are feature sufficiency, layout, local similarity, and representation quality of the map. Then, in order to quantify these criteria, we introduce several factors for each criterion. Unlike evaluation criteria which are defined regardless of the map formats, factors are defined based on normal distribution map which is a map format of normal distribution transformation scan-matching. These factors are calculated for each position in the map, based on the map features within its local vicinity. By conducting the experiments in Shinjuku, Japan, we have evaluated these factors in a different part of the map with different scenarios by comparing them with the self-localization error.

AB Food-energy-water (FEW) nexus analysis is critical for sustainable urban development. The synergies among various resources flows in the urban agriculture network and the green transportation (GT) system with sus-tainability credentials of autonomous electric vehicles become an emerging research topic of interest in a FEW nexus. An agent-based modeling (ABM) framework using the NetLogo software platform was developed in this study to simulate extensive interactions among these FEW agents (consumers, producers, microgrid operators, water managers, and GT vehicles) to better understand the linkages and interactions between produce of urban farming and GT. The proposed ABM framework is illustrated by analyzing seven scenarios based on a case study of a food desert elimination plan in the Great Miami Metropolitan Region, south Florida. The region contains several urban agriculture sites within an urban agriculture network designed to contribute a new food supply to the local community demarcated as food deserts. In the FEW contexts, a group of autonomous electric vehicles is introduced to increase site access to these urban agriculture sites for the local consumers. Findings show that the integration of a GT system in an urban agriculture network can lead to more efficient and sustainable operation in a low-carbon city.

AB Predicting the future can significantly improve the safety of intelligent vehicles, which is a key component in autonomous driving. 3D point clouds can accurately model 3D information of surrounding environment and are crucial for intelligent vehicles to perceive the scene. Therefore, prediction of 3D point clouds has great significance for intelligent vehicles, which can be utilized for numerous further applications. However, due to point clouds are unordered and unstructured, point cloud prediction is challenging and has not been deeply explored in current literature. In this paper, we propose a novel motion-based neural network named MoNet. The key idea of the proposed MoNet is to integrate motion features between two consecutive point clouds into the prediction pipeline. The introduction of motion features enables the model to more accurately capture the variations of motion information across frames and thus make better predictions for future motion. In addition, content features are introduced to model the spatial content of individual point clouds. A recurrent neural network named MotionRNN is proposed to capture the temporal correlations of both features. Moreover, an attention-based motion align module is proposed to address the problem of missing motion features in the inference pipeline. Extensive experiments on two large-scale outdoor LiDAR point cloud datasets demonstrate the performance of the proposed MoNet. Moreover, we perform experiments on applications using the predicted point clouds and the results indicate the great application potential of the proposed method.

AB Unmanned floating vehicles (UFVs) can play a major role in the removal of invasive floating aquatic weeds in the water bodies. To provide automation to those UFVs, image or video processing techniques are helpful. Waterline detection from the sky-land-water region is the primary step for UFV autonomous navigation. After detecting the water region, object detection in the water region is the secondary step. In this paper, an object detection algorithm in water for low cost UFVs is proposed. Real-time and accurate waterline detection is done by using the K-means algorithm and Fast Marching method and it is compared with the Hough transform. Objects are detected accurately in the water region by a modified gradient-based image processing algorithm. In this algorithm, instead of Sobel Gradient Operator, Finite Difference Central Gradient Operator is used to achieve high accuracy in detecting objects in the water region. Floating green color weeds are also detected from objects using the green color of the weeds, and weed percentage is also calculated. Experiments were done on Own datasets, and OSF datasets containing freely floating plants, small cluster plants, and birds. Raspberry Pi 3 Model-B processor is used to implement this proposed algorithm. These performance metrics results show that the proposed detection approach is effective, more accurate, and suitable to different lake environments.

AB Automated vehicles (AVs) already navigate US highways and those of many other nations around the world. Current questions about AVs do not now revolve around whether such technologies should or should not be implemented; they are already with us. Rather, such questions are more and more focused on how such technologies will impact evolving transportation systems, our social world, and the individuals who live within it and whether such systems ought to be fully automated or remain under some form of direct human control. More importantly, how will mobility itself change as these independent operational vehicles first share and then dominate our roadways? How will the public be kept apprised of their evolving capacities, and what will be the impact of science and the communication of scientific advances across the varying forms of social media on these developments? We look here to address these issues and to provide some suggestions for the problems that are currently emerging.

AB A method is presented for the longitudinal control of autonomous vehicles forming a multi-brand, ad hoc platoon. A leader and predecessor following (LPF) control architecture is known to allow string stable platooning with shorter safety gaps between vehicles as compared with predecessor following schemes. General LPF strategies, however, require the exact knowledge of spacing policies of predecessor vehicles for correctly specifying a spacing with respect to the leader. It follows that arbitrary spacing policies in ad hoc platoons prevent the applicability of classical LPF control structures. It is shown in this paper that it is possible to exploit the advantages of LPF architectures in multi-brand platoons without a priori knowledge of spacing policies of predecessors. The unknown spacing policies are replaced by a virtual one, which serves as an input to a two degree of freedom LPF controller. The resulting control structure enables the organization of ad hoc platoons consisting of vehicles with different spacing policies. Computer simulations are presented to illustrate the statements.

AB This paper presents a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) algorithm for heterogeneous vehicle platoons with unidirectional topologies and a priori unknown desired set point. The vehicles (or nodes) in a platoon are dynamically decoupled but constrained by spatial geometry. Each node is assigned a local open-loop optimal control problem only relying on the information of neighboring nodes, in which the cost function is designed by penalizing on the errors between the predicted and assumed trajectories. Together with this penalization, an equality-based terminal constraint is proposed to ensure stability, which enforces the terminal states of each node in the predictive horizon equal to the average of its neighboring states. By using the sum of local cost functions as a Lyapunov candidate, it is proved that asymptotic stability of such a DMPC can be achieved through an explicit sufficient condition on the weights of the cost functions. Simulations with passenger cars demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DMPC.

TI Feature Analysis on Mixed Traffic Flow of Manually Driven and Autonomous
   Vehicles Based on Cellular Automata
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID MODEL; RECOGNITION
AB This paper attempts to disclose the features of the mixed traffic flow of manually driven vehicles (MVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs). Considering dynamic headway, the mixed traffic flow was modelled based on the improved single-land cellular automata (CA) traffic flow model (DHD) proposed by Zhang Ningxi. The established CA model was adopted to obtain the maximum flow of the mixed traffic flow and was analyzed under different proportions of AVs. On this basis, the features of the mixed traffic flow were summarized. The main results are as follows: the proportion of AVs has a significant impact on the mixed traffic flow; when the proportion reached 0.6, the flow of the whole lane was twice that of the MV traffic flow. At a low density, the AV proportion has an obvious influence on mixed traffic flow. At a high density, the mixed traffic flow changed very little, as the AV proportion increased from 0 to 5. The reason is that the flow of the whole lane is constrained by the fact that MVs cannot move faster. However, when the AV proportion reached 0.8, the flow of the whole lane became three times that at the proportion of 0.6. At the speed of 126 km/h, the flow rate was 2.5 times the speed limit of 54 km/h. The findings lay a theoretical basis for the modelling of multilane mixed traffic flow.

AB Autonomous vehicle traffic information systems are an important research direction for next-generation traffic information systems. Existing centralized traffic information systems involve a large initial investment and high operating costs. Furthermore, they suffer from the following problems: the need to communicate large amounts of data, requiring a longer time for road network coverage, unsteady transmission, and the need for an automatic generation and update method for road network congestion information in a large-scale urban road network. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes an intelligent vehicular traffic information system (IVTIS) based on a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET). This system employs a local road network and rapid dissemination model (IVTIS-LNFRN) of congestion information based on link nodes for a large-scale urban road network, and it constructs the corresponding system models. We then use traffic simulation software to evaluate the feasibility of the IVTIS. In particular, we investigate the collection, diffusion, and dissemination of congestion information and the automatic generation and update effect of road network congestion information. Furthermore, we analyze the dissemination effect of different traffic inflow volumes, information packet loss rates, and different rates of IVTIS vehicles. The simulation results show that the proposed system has good autonomy and overall performance in terms of the real-time collection and rapid dissemination of congestion information in a large-scale urban road network.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) communication have great potential to improve traffic safety and mobility at intersection and road segment levels. However, since transportation is an interconnected network, local transportation state change could lead to broader impacts by rerouting. In this study, we focus on investigating the impacts of en-route locational information updates on the system-level safety and mobility con-sidering adaptive routing of CAVs. We propose a novel two-stage stochastic traffic equilibrium model to characterize the equilibrium traffic patterns considering adaptive routing behavior when en-route traffic information is provided. The proposed methodology is tested using the Orlando transportation network with real traffic and accident data. Different I2V information sharing strategies are analyzed to better understand the impacts of information sharing locations of I2V on transportation network safety and mobility, through which we generate insights on the optimal design of traffic information sharing systems.

AB Vehicle steering control is crucial to autonomous vehicles. However, unknown parameters and uncertainties of vehicle steering systems bring a great challenge to its control performance, which needs to be tackled urgently. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel model free controller based on reinforcement learning for active steering system with unknown parameters. The model of the active steering system and the Brushless Direct Current (BLDC) motor is built to construct a virtual object in simulations. The agent based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm is built, including actor network and critic network. The rewards from environment are designed to improve the effectiveness of agent. Simulations and testbench experiments are implemented to train the agent and verify the effectiveness of the controller. Results show that the proposed algorithm can acquire the network parameters and achieve effective control performance without any prior knowledges or models. The proposed agent can adapt to different vehicles or active steering systems easily and effectively with only retraining of the network parameters.

AB Accurate modeling of lower-level controller plays an important role in the traffic flow of automated vehicles (AVs). However, there lacks enough attention with this respect. To address this issue, we conduct a field experiment with two vehicles that are equipped with developable autonomous driving system, where one can customize the upper-level control algorithm. Based on the field experimental data, two new lower-level control models are developed and compared with two widely used ones. The comparison results show that the proposed models outperform the two previous models in capturing the observed actual acceleration, especially the troughs of the acceleration time series. Furthermore, theoretical analysis indicates that comparing with the proposed models, the two previous models significantly overestimate the stability region of the traffic flow of the AVs and the capacity of stable traffic flow. Our study is expected to further shed light on the importance of accurate lower-level control modeling.

AB To better prepare and guide both intersection planning and operations under different market penetration rates (MPRs) of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and traffic demands, this research estimates both the lane-level and intersection-level capacity. On the lane-level, adjustment factors for saturation headway and saturation traffic flow rate for each lane under different MPRs of CAVs are investigated. On the intersection-level, the maximum throughput function for different MPRs of CAVs is calibrated. With 100% CAVs, the saturation headways for the exclusive through lane, exclusive left-turn lane, and shared-right-and-through lane decrease by 55.8%, 48.9%, and 42.4%, respectively. The maximum throughput of the intersection with 100% CAVs increases by 70% compared to the scenario with only human driving vehicles (HDVs). Moreover, the maximum throughput increases rapidly after 60% MPRs of CAVs. The research could provide a solid reference for traffic engineers and planners in calculating the intersection capacity under different MPRs of CAVs.

AB In this paper, we investigate the placement of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) base station (BS) which serves multiple ground users (GUs). By taking into account both the uplink and downlink transmissions, we aim to optimize the 3D location of the UAV for maximizing the minimum average sum rate. The 3D location optimization problem is divided into the horizontal coordinate and the height optimization subproblems, respectively. We further apply the CVX toolbox to solve the horizontal coordinate optimization problem and transform the height optimization problem into the elevation angle optimization problem to obtain its solution. Our numerical results show that the minimum average sum rate of the proposed 3D location optimization scheme is higher than that of the numerical search (NS) based location optimization method, that of the energy-efficient maximal coverage (EEMC) based location optimization method and that of the random location method, for different distributions of GUs' locations.

AB A combination of market forces, cost constraints, and other factors necessitates incremental evolution of a fully automated highway system (AHS) rather than instantaneous deployment. Thus, an understanding of the interdependencies among required AHS functional capabilities is essential for planning. In this paper a set of three AHS functional evolution reference models is proposed that include essential as well as supplemental functions. The reference models include lateral motion handling, longitudinal motion handling, obstacle handling, and selected infrastructure support functions. This family of three models is used to present the needs of baseline autonomous tactical vehicle operation, the benefits of adding inter-vehicle communications, and the benefits of adding infrastructure support. The reference models reveal a critical need for vehicle motion prediction capability and suggest that both communications and infrastructure support are beneficial but not mandatory for achieving an AHS. Furthermore, there appear to be a number of safety and efficiency benefits that can be realized with only partial automation and in some cases no automation. These results could help set priorities and guide strategies for incremental introduction of AHS technology into vehicles and roadways.

AB An approach based on Artificial Neural Networks is proposed in this paper to improve the localisation accuracy of Inertial Navigation Systems (INS)/Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) based aided navigation during the absence of GNSS signals. The INS can be used to continuously position autonomous vehicles during GNSS signal losses around urban canyons, bridges, tunnels and trees, however, it suffers from unbounded exponential error drifts cascaded over time during the multiple integrations of the accelerometer and gyroscope measurements to position. More so, the error drift is characterised by a pattern dependent on time. This paper proposes several efficient neural network-based solutions to estimate the error drifts using Recurrent Neural Networks, such as the Input Delay Neural Network (IDNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (vRNN), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). In contrast to previous papers published in literature, which focused on travel routes that do not take complex driving scenarios into consideration, this paper investigates the performance of the proposed methods on challenging scenarios, such as hard brake, roundabouts, sharp cornering, successive left and right turns and quick changes in vehicular acceleration across numerous test sequences. The results obtained show that the Neural Network-based approaches are able to provide up to 89.55% improvement on the INS displacement estimation and 93.35% on the INS orientation rate estimation.

AB This paper describes the use of an active disturbance rejection controller (ADRC) to estimate and compensate for the effect of slip in an online manner to improve the path tracking performance of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs). AGVs with skid-steer locomotion mode are extensively used for robotic applications in the fields of agriculture, transportation, construction, warehouse maintenance, and mining. Majority of these applications such as performing reconnaissance and rescue operations in rough terrain or autonomous package delivery in urban scenarios, require the system to follow a path predetermined by a high-level planner or based on a predefined task. In the absence of effective slip estimation and compensation, the AGVs, especially tracked vehicles, can fail to follow the path as given out by the high-level planner. The proposed ADRC architecture uses a generic mathematical model that can account for the scaling and shift in the states of the system due to the effects of slip through augmented parameters. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) observer is used to estimate the varying slip parameters online. The estimated parameters are then used to compensate for the effects of slip at each iteration by modifying the control actions given by a low-level path tracking controller. The proposed approach is validated through experiments over flat and uneven terrain conditions including asphalt, vinyl flooring, artificial turf, grass, and gravel using a tracked skid-steer mobile robot. A detailed discussion on the results and directions for future research is also presented.

AB The detection of dynamic and static obstacles is a key task for the navigation of autonomous ground vehicles. The article presents a new algorithm for generating an occupancy map of the surrounding space from noisy point clouds obtained from one or several stereo cameras. The camera images are segmented by the proposed deep neural network FCN-ResNet-M-OC, which combines the speed of the FCN-ResNet method and improves the quality of the model using the concept of object context representation. The paper investigates supervised approaches to network training on unbalanced samples with road scenes such as the weighted cross entropy and the Focal Loss. The occupancy map is built from point clouds with semantic labels, in which static environment and potentially dynamic obstacles are highlighted. Our solution is operational in real time and applicable on platforms with limited computing resources. The approach was tested on autonomous vehicle datasets: Semantic KITTI, KITTI-360, Mapillary Vistas and custom OpenTaganrog. The usage of semantically labeled point clouds increased the precision of obstacle detection by an average of 17. The performance of the entire approach on various computing platforms with Jetson Xavier, RTX3070, GPUs NVidia Tesla V100 is respectively from 10 to 15 FPS for input image resolution $1920\times 1080$ pixels.

AB The vehicles used for transportation and logistics in the factories usually perceive their surroundings with range sensors. Today, 2D LIDARs are used as range sensors, and 3D LIDARs are becoming widespread with the developments of autonomous vehicle technology. Therefore, Self Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization, abbreviated as SA-MCL, is improved in this study to make the algorithm suitable for autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) equipped with 2D or 3D LIDARs. Moreover, the traditional SA-MCL algorithm has a constraint that the range sensors on the robot are uniformly placed, and ellipse based energy model is proposed in this study to remove the constraint. This model can compute the energy value regardless of the robot orientation since it considers offsets due to the asymmetric placement of range sensors on the robot. The importance of localization increases since it is aimed that AGVs to be used in smart factories are able to use entire free space on the map in order to provide energy efficiency and time saving, and perform tasks that can vary at anytime instead of routine. SA-MCL algorithm is preferred in this study since traditional SA-MCL can overcome global localization, position tracking and kidnapping sub-problems of localization. The algorithm proposed in this study is verified to demonstrate its performance and effectiveness both in simulation and experimental studies using MATLAB and robot operating system (ROS).

TI A Parameterized Geometric Magnetic Field Calibration Method for Vehicles
   with Moving Masses with Applications to Underwater Gliders
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
ID MAGNETOMETER
AB The accuracy of magnetic measurements performed by autonomous vehicles is often limited by the presence of moving ferrous masses. This work presents a parameterized ellipsoid field calibration method for magnetic measurements in the sensor frame. In this manner, the ellipsoidal calibration coefficients are dependent on the locations of the moving masses. The parameterized calibration method is evaluated through field trials with an autonomous underwater glider equipped with a low power precision fluxgate sensor. A first set of field trials were performed in the East Arm of Bonne Bay, Newfoundland, in December 2013. During these trials, a series of calibration profiles with the mass shifting and ballast mechanisms at different locations were performed before and after the survey portion of the trials. Further trials were performed in the Labrador Sea in July 2014 with two reduced sets of calibration runs. The nominal ellipsoidal coefficients were extracted using the full set of measurements from a set of calibration profiles and used as the initial conditions for the polynomials, which define each parameterized coefficient. These polynomials as well as the sensor misalignment matrix were then optimized using a gradient descent solver, which minimizes both the total magnetic field difference and the vertical magnetic field variance between the modeled and measured values. Including the vertical field in this manner allows for convergence in spite of severe limitations on the platform's motion and for computation of the vehicle's magnetic heading.

AB Growing research attention is focusing on Automated Vehicle (AV) technologies, promising significant safety benefits. An in-depth understanding of human driving will play an important role in determining the most acceptable AV behaviour, supporting passenger comfort and thus the adoption of the technology, but also the optimal prediction of the behaviour of the surrounding traffic. The current study examined 1740 real-world motorway pull-out manoeuvres (pull-out distance, speed differential with the leading vehicle, manoeuvre duration, pull-out comfort zone) under different conditions. The results highlighted the significant impact of the surrounding traffic and the driving characteristics on or before the manoeuvre initiation point, which reflected the overtaking strategy selected. The findings can inform the design of automated overtaking systems that resemble human driving and thus encourage their uptake; in addition, they can assist the intention prediction for lane keeping assistance systems in order to optimise the system's response to cutting in and pull-out manoeuvres.

AB In this paper, we provide a hierarchical coordination framework for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) at two adjacent intersections. This framework consists of an upper-level scheduling problem and a low-level optimal control problem. By partitioning the area around two adjacent intersections into different zones, we formulate a scheduling problem for each individual CAV aimed at minimizing its total travel time. For each CAV, the solution of the upper-level problem designates the arrival times at each zones on its path which becomes the inputs of the low-level problem. The solution of the low-level problem yields the optimal control input (acceleration/deceleration) of each CAV to exit the intersections at the time specified in the upper-level scheduling problem. We validate the performance of our proposed hierarchical framework through extensive numerical simulations and comparison with signalized intersections, centralized scheduling, and FIFO queuing policy.

AB Some new Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) need on-the-lane vehicle positioning on accurate digital maps, but current applications of vehicle positioning do not justify the surcharge of very accurate equipment such as DGPS or high-cost inertial systems. For this reason, the performance of GPS in autonomous mode is analyzed. Although satisfactory results can be found, in some areas the GPS signal is lost or degraded so it is necessary to know the positioning error when using only inertial system data. A theoretical approach based on the uncertainty propagation law is used to estimate the upper limit of distance that can be travelled fulfilling the specifications of an assistance system. Test results support the conclusions of this approach. Finally, the combination of GPS and inertial systems is studied, with the conclusion that the theoretical approach is valid when inertial measurements are used right from the start of GPS signal degradation, without waiting for a complete loss of signal.

AB Urban form develops in close feedback with different modes of transportation. The introduction and adoption of automated vehicles (AVs) are expected to have an impact on the development of cities as well, as the use of AVs may, for example, lead to more efficient road use and less need for parking spaces. In order to study those impacts, we developed a geospatially disaggregated system dynamics (SD) model, through the use of subscripts, of the Copenhagen metropolitan region. We used this SD model to explore the consequences of 12 main uncertainties related to the introduction of AVs on urban development and develop future scenarios following the exploratory modelling and analysis methodology. Our analysis led to two distinct scenarios. In one scenario, AVs lead to more vehicle use, which leads to more urban sprawl and more congestion as a consequence. In the other scenario, more shared use of cars leads to less traffic and more open space in the city.

AB The intelligence level of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is continuously improving, which puts forward higher requirements for reliability and safety. However, the high cost and low efficiency of experiments and the lack of failure data and safety index are important factors hindering the improvement of UAVs' safety. This article aims to design a safety assessment approach based on a proposed profust safety index and autopilot hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation to provide a new solution. First, the simulation data of UAVs under fault or abnormal conditions are generated from an HIL simulation platform with high-fidelity dynamic models and 3-D visualization models. Then, the profust safety index based on the profust reliability theory is proposed to quantitatively describe the safety status of UAVs, and this article presents a novo and simple approach to calculate the accident probability. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by the comparison of simulation and experiments. Finally, the impact of different failure modes on the safety of UAVs is analyzed through a large number of fault simulations of different components, and a set of simulation datasets along with the HIL platform is released to provide a reference for the safety and health assessment and fault diagnosis of UAVs.

AB Network congestion is a major issue affecting communications in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) under high vehicle density scenarios. The common idea used by emergency message broadcast protocols to overcome this challenge is to reduce the number of retransmissions. This is achieved by suppressing redundant retransmissions while maintaining broadcast reliability. In this paper, we analyze the problem of inaccurate suppression of redundant retransmissions in delay-based broadcast protocols and propose uHBS (unHurried Broadcast Suppression), a new more efficient broadcast suppression mechanism. uHBS avoids inaccurate decisions to suppress or forward an emergency message by considering the occurrence of duplicate receptions of this message and using an indication about the channel's busy status. Next, we use the proposed uHBS mechanism as a basis for designing uHBS-DP (uHBS based Dissemination Protocol), a novel delay based protocol for broadcasting emergency messages in urban vehicular networks. The simulation results show that uHBS-DP, using the proposed broadcast suppression mechanism, significantly improves the efficiency of emergency message broadcasting by ensuring high reliability with low broadcasting overhead, compared to two other variants of uHBS-DP that use conventional suppression mechanisms. Furthermore, the results show a substantial improvement, compared to a well known protocol, in terms of reduced collision ratio (up to 36.57%), lower dissemination delay (up to 19.17%) and reduced broadcast overhead (up to 19.28%).

AB In this paper, a novel real-time obstacle avoidance method based on Dynamic System (DS), is proposed. The proposed method ensures the impenetrability of multiple convex obstacles by online modulating the original velocity field of the DS. It can be applied to perform obstacle avoidance in the state space of the DS with both autonomous and non-autonomous DS-based con-trollers. While realizing the obstacle avoidance, the equilibrium points of the original DS can be saved. The modulation matrix form is extended based on the earlier dynamic system modulation methods of the literature. The asymmetric modulation provided by this method allows the modu-lated DS to satisfy the dynamic constraints of a class of DSs. In addition, the proposed method has the inherent ability of multiple-obstacle avoidance and the direction selectivity of avoidance maneu-ver. Moreover, to solve the simultaneous guidance and obstacle avoidance problem, a guidance law for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) based on the proposed method, is designed. Finally, a numerical simulation is performed to analyze the performance of the proposed method and the obstacle avoidance guidance law.(c) 2022 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

AB This study investigated lane-changing characteristics with regard to drivers' aggressiveness in rain and clear weather utilizing the SHRP2 Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) dataset. An innovative methodology was developed to identify lane-changing events and extract corresponding parameters from the SHRP2 NDS database. Initially, K-means and K-medoids clustering methods were examined to classify drivers into non-aggressive and aggressive categories considering six features related to driving behavior, and K-means clustering was adopted based on the average silhouette width method (ASWM). Two-level mixed-effects linear regression models were calibrated to assess the contributing factors that affect lane-changing durations, which revealed that different vehicle kinematics, traffic, driver, and roadway characteristics, as well as weather conditions combined with other factors, were significant in the calibrated models for both driver types. The results revealed that the lane-changing duration associated with heavy rain decreased with a higher speed limit for aggressive drivers. Furthermore, the lane-changing duration associated with light/moderate rain decreased with the number of lanes for non-aggressive drivers. The study findings could be leveraged to incorporate drivers' aggressiveness into microsimulation lane-changing model calibration and validation as well as could have significant implications in improving safety in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV).

AB In this paper an approach-angle-based three-dimensional path-following control scheme has been proposed for underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) which experiences unknown actuator saturation and environmental disturbance. First, the path-following error dynamic model is derived based on the principle of relative motion which was followed by the design of approach-angle-based guidance law in both horizontal and vertical profiles of AUV to transform the three-dimensional tracking errors into heading angle and elevation angle tracking errors. The kinematic control law is designed based on the Lyapunov theory and backstepping technique. Second, the kinetic controller is designed based on the Lyapunov theory, backstepping technique and fuzzy logic system approximation method. The indirect adaptive fuzzy logic system is applied to approximate unknown smooth functions which are composed of coupled AUV hydrodynamics and complex differentials of desired pitch and yaw velocities. Moreover, the application of fuzzy control completely free from dependence on accurate AUV kinetic model. Considering a disturbance-like term, which is comprised of fuzzy logic system approximation error and bounded ocean disturbance, an adaptive law is designed to estimate the bound of it. Finally, two sets of comparative numerical simulations, including straight path following with different initial posture and spatial helix path following with sudden disturbance, are studied to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control scheme.

AB This paper reports on developing autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) survey methods for ocean outfall discharge plumes and new insights gained on plume mixing. Unique to the study is mapping the discharge mixing using colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) calibrated for effluent dilution. AUV mission planning methodologies for discharge plume sampling, plume characterization using onboard temperature, salinity and optical sensors, and comparison of observational data to model results are presented for the Point Loma Ocean Outfall offshore of San Diego, CA. The results are expected to be applicable to the general theme of mixing of submerged buoyant discharges. In the near-field, the plume is found to mix to a height consistent with the predictions of buoyant jet engineering models. At the far-field, the fine spatial scales of the plume resolved by the vehicle suggests that shear instabilities caused by internal waves can enhance plume mixing and elevate the discharge plume above the predicted equilibrium rise height. These results suggest that even under variable oceanic conditions, properly planned missions for AUVs equipped with an optical CDOM sensor in addition to traditional physical oceanographic sensors, can accurately map the mixing of ocean outfall plumes at resolutions not possible with traditional boat-based techniques. Variations of oceanic conditions are found to influence the mixing and fate of the plume at time scales generally not considered in the design of these discharges.

AB This paper describes a novel physics-based path planning architecture for autonomous navigation of tracked vehicles in rough terrain conditions. Unlike conventional path planning applications for smooth and structured environments, factors such as slip, slope of the terrain, robot actuator limitations, and dynamics of robot terrain interactions must be considered for rough terrain applications. The proposed path planning method consists of a hybrid planner/simulator, which takes into account all of the above factors by simulating the closed loop motion of the robot with a low-level controller on a realistic terrain model inside a physics engine. Once a feasible path to the goal is obtained, the same low-level closed loop controller is then used to execute the proposed path on the actual robot. The proposed architecture uses the D* Lite algorithm working on a 2D grid representation of the terrain as the high-level planner, Bullet as the physics engine and a hybrid automaton as the low-level closed loop controller. The proposed method is validated both in simulation and through experiments. Inferences based on the results from simulations and experiments show that the proposed planner is more effective in providing an optimal feasible path as compared to existing methodologies, demonstrating clear advantages for rough, unstructured terrain planning. Based on the results, possible improvements to the method are proposed for future work.

AB This paper presents an integrated navigation system for underwater vehicles to improve the performance of a conventional inertial acoustic navigation system by introducing range measurement. The integrated navigation system is based on a strapdown inertial navigation system (SDINS) accompanying range sensor, Doppler velocity log (DVL), magnetic compass, and depth sensor. Two measurement models of the range sensor are derived and augmented to the inertial acoustic navigation system, respectively. A multirate extended Kalman filter (EKF) is adopted to propagate the error covariance with the inertial sensors, where the filter updates the measurement errors and the error covariance and corrects the system states when the external measurements are available. This paper demonstrates the improvement on the robustness and convergence of the integrated navigation system with range aiding (RA). This paper used experimental data obtained from a rotating arm test with a fish model to simulate the navigational performance. Strong points of the navigation system are the elimination of initial position errors and the robustness on the dropout of acoustic signals. The convergence speed and conditions of the initial error removal are examined with Monte Carlo simulation. In addition, numerical simulations are conducted with the six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) equations of motion of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in a boustrophedon survey mode to illustrate the effectiveness of the integrated navigation system.

AB In electric vehicles (EVs), addressing noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) has become pivotal, especially concerning external wind noise. To reduce wind noise, a door inner belt weatherstrip needs a high contact load, but this can lead to squeaking noise at the glass/weatherstrip interface. This study demonstrates a multidisciplinary design for the weatherstrip to tackle both issues. By increasing ethylene propylene diene monomer and ethylidene norbornene contents in the thermoplastic vulcanizate (TPV) by about 20 % and 70 %, respectively, the compression set was reduced from 35.4 % to 27.6 %. Concurrently, the TPV's damping properties improved, with a 25 % increase in loss modulus (323 MPa). Coated flocking surface of weatherstrip significantly reduced the friction coefficient by 80 % (from 1.75 to 0.30). In vehicle evaluations, the newly designed weatherstrip reduced the wind noise by 5 dB(A) and eliminated. This approach highlights the potential of multidisciplinary design in optimizing NVH for next-generation vehicles, including autonomous EVs and urban air mobility.

ID DESIGN
AB L-1 adaptive controllers are proposed to control fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle attitude for both longitudinal and lateral motions simultaneously. A full-order nonlinear model of the aircraft, where actuator dynamics are considered, is used to design the proposed controllers. The different motion objectives of the aircraft are controlled via separate control loops. Based on the gap metric concept, two single-input single-output controllers are used for the longitudinal motion; and one multi-input multi-output for the lateral motion. For each loop, a suitable L-1 adaptive controller is designed, and the coupling between the loops is treated as a time-varying uncertainty. The full-order nonlinear model with the proposed controllers is used to evaluate the closed-loop performance by simulation. The simulation results show that the controllers ensure that the system outputs asymptotically track the outputs of an ideal system. The overall performance of the proposed controllers is drastically improved compared to that of standard PID controllers.

ID OBSERVABILITY; ARRAY
AB In this paper, we describe an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) behavior designed to track nearby vessels using bearing-only measurements obtained from a rigidly mounted planar hydrophone array-one that was originally designed for active sonar use but is repurposed for passive sonar use. Upon detecting a target, a maneuver is executed to resolve the port/starboard bearing ambiguity. The maneuver is heuristically designed with the aim of reducing the effects of end-fire, self-noise during maneuvers, and other noise/spurious measurements on the bearing ambiguity decision. After resolving the bearing ambiguity, the vehicle continuously adjusts its heading to track the target by keeping it broadside to the array. The performance of this behavior, as well as that of the passive sonar itself, is evaluated through field trials in the approaches to Boston Harbor using a Bluefin-21 UUV. In total, 19 successful behavior tests are described where the UUV resolves the bearing ambiguity and tracks either a static source emitting a predefined waveform or the platform noise of a medium-sized catamaran underway.

TI 2D map-building and localization in outdoor environments
SO JOURNAL OF ROBOTIC SYSTEMS

DT Article
AB Determining the pose (position and orientation) of a vehicle at any time is termed localization and is of paramount importance in achieving reliable and robust autonomous navigation. Knowing the pose it is possible to achieve high level tasks such as path planning. A new map-based algorithm for the localization of vehicles operating in harsh outdoor environments is presented in this article. A map building algorithm using observations from a scanning laser rangefinder is developed for building a polyline map that adequately captures the geometry of the environment. Using this map, the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is employed for matching laser range images from the rangefinder to the polyline map. Once correspondences are established, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm provides reliable vehicle state estimates using a nonlinear observation model based on the vertices of the polyline map. Data gathered during field trials in an outdoor environment is used to test the efficiency of the proposed ICP-EKF algorithm in achieving the localization of a four-wheel drive (4WD) vehicle.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) navigation is aimed at guiding a UAV to the desired destinations along a collision-free and efficient path without human interventions, and it plays a crucial role in autonomous missions in harsh environments. The recently emerging Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods have shown promise for addressing the UAV navigation problem, but most of these methods cannot converge due to the massive amounts of interactive data when a UAV is navigating in high dynamic environments, where there are numerous obstacles moving fast. In this work, we propose an improved DRL-based method to tackle these fundamental limitations. To be specific, we develop a distributed DRL framework to decompose the UAV navigation task into two simpler sub-tasks, each of which is solved through the designed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based DRL network by using only part of the interactive data. Furthermore, a clipped DRL loss function is proposed to closely stack the two sub-solutions into one integral for the UAV navigation problem. Extensive simulation results are provided to corroborate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of the convergence and effectiveness compared with those of the state-of-the-art DRL methods. ? 2020 Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

AB Path tracking control is one of the essential controls for lateral positioning controls such as collision avoidance and lane keeping and changing. In severe situations in which the tire force reaches its limit, such as entering a corner at high speed or in a low-friction situation, not only accurate path tracking but also stable driving must be ensured. In this paper, an integrated braking and steering controller for path tracking is proposed in consideration of the road friction limit. In particular, individual tire forces were predicted using the vehicle and the tire models, and the results were directly compared with the road friction. A nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) was utilized for constrained optimal control using nonlinear models. The proposed controller is verified through vehicle simulators Carsim and MATLAB Simulink. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed controller: it guarantees stable driving and accurate tracking performance.

TI Three-Dimensional Position and Velocity Regulation of a Quad-Rotorcraft

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS

DT Article
AB We address the problem of hover flight and translational velocity regulation of a quad-rotorcraft unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with the main objective of allowing the vehicle to navigate autonomously. This paper complements and improves previous researches considering multiple-camera systems and nonconventional sensors, which deal only with stabilizing the aerial vehicle in hover or in take-off and landing tasks. A vision system has been implemented to estimate the vehicle's altitude, lateral position, and forward velocity during flights. It is shown that, using visual information, it is possible to develop control strategies for different kinds of flying modes, such as hover flight and forward flight at constant velocity. The stability of the closed-loop system is ensured by implementing a hierarchical control strategy. In the first stage, the performance of the proposed methodologies was validated under a simulation environment, showing satisfactory and promising results. Next, real-time experimental applications, consisting of autonomous hover and forward flight at constant velocity, were successfully achieved, validating the effectiveness of the proposed imaging algorithm and vision-based controller.

AB We develop a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DeepRL)-based, multi-agent algorithm to efficiently control autonomous vehicles that are typically used within the context of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), in order to boost application performance. As an application example, we consider wireless acoustic sensor networks where a group of speakers move inside a room. In a traditional setup, microphones cannot move autonomously and are, e.g., located at fixed positions. We claim that autonomously moving microphones improve the application performance. To control these movements, we compare simple greedy heuristics against a DeepRL solution and show that the latter achieves best application performance. As the range of audio applications is broad and each has its own (subjective) per-formance metric, we replace those application metrics by two immediately observable ones: First, quality of information (QoI), which is used to measure the quality of sensed data (e.g., audio signal strength). Second, quality of service (QoS), which is used to measure the network's performance when forwarding data (e.g., delay). In this context, we propose two multi-agent solutions (where one agent controls one microphone) and show that they perform similarly to a single-agent solution (where one agent controls all microphones and has a global knowledge). Moreover, we show via simulations and theoretical analysis how other parameters such as the number of microphones and their speed impacts performance.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Controllability analysis is significant for guidance law optimization and control system synthesis during atmospheric landing of hypersonic flight vehicles. This article concerns the problem of quantifying the controllability and developing a novel controllability measure, i.e., the degree of controllability (DOC), for linear (or linearized) time-varying systems, and conducts the hierarchically quantitative controllability analysis in high-dynamic guidance for autonomous vehicle landing. In particular, a novel DOC criterion is derived via analyzing the characteristics of singular values and the condition number of the controllability Gramian. The proposed DOC criterion can offer a deep insight into the controllability of both the system and each state subspace, and thus, it possesses a clear physical meaning in practice. Furthermore, a certain normalization and modification method is designed to make the criterion more applicable in aerospace engineering. To validate the derived criterion, the scenario of 3-DOF Mars entry guidance is simulated based on a reference-trajectory tracking scheme with active disturbance rejection control algorithm. According to the simulation results, the optimality of different reference trajectories can be evaluated and compared via the DOC criterion. Therefore, the DOC criterion can function as an indicator to analyze the influence of trajectory parameters on the landing process from the perspective of controllability analysis.

AB The intelligent vehicle community has devoted considerable efforts to model driver behavior, and in particular, to detect and overcome driver distraction in an effort to reduce accidents caused by driver negligence. However, as the domain increasingly shifts toward autonomous and semiautonomous solutions, the driver is no longer integral to the decision-making process, indicating a need to refocus efforts elsewhere. To this end, we propose to study pedestrian distraction instead. In particular, we focus on detecting pedestrians who are engaged in secondary activities involving their cellphones and similar hand-held multimedia devices from a purely vision-based standpoint. To achieve this objective, we propose a pipeline incorporating articulated human pose estimation, followed by a soft object label transfer from an ensemble of exemplar support vector machines trained on the nearest neighbors in pose feature space. We additionally incorporate head gaze features and prior pose information to carry out cellphone related pedestrian activity recognition. Finally, we offer a method to reliably track the articulated pose of a pedestrian through a sequence of images using a particle filter with a Gaussian process dynamical model, which can then be used to estimate sequentially varying activity scores at a very low computational cost. The entire framework is fast (especially for sequential data) and accurate, and easily extensible to include other secondary activities and sources of distraction.

AB Landing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomously and safely is a challenging task. Although the existing approaches have resolved the problem of precise landing by identifying a specific landing marker using the UAV's onboard vision system, the vast majority of these works are conducted in either daytime or well-illuminated laboratory environments. In contrast, very few researchers have investigated the possibility of landing in low-illumination conditions by employing various active light sources to lighten the markers. In this paper, a novel vision system design is proposed to tackle UAV landing in outdoor extreme low-illumination environments without the need to apply an active light source to the marker. We use a model-based enhancement scheme to improve the quality and brightness of the onboard captured images, then present a hierarchical-based method consisting of a decision tree with an associated light-weight convolutional neural network (CNN) for coarse-to-fine landing marker localization, where the key information of the marker is extracted and reserved for post-processing, such as pose estimation and landing control. Extensive evaluations have been conducted to demonstrate the robustness, accuracy, and real-time performance of the proposed vision system. Field experiments across a variety of outdoor nighttime scenarios with an average luminance of 5 lx at the marker locations have proven the feasibility and practicability of the system.

AB The Idukki Reservoir at an altitude of 748 m covering an area of 53 km(2) is surrounded by tropical forests in the Western Ghats in the southwestern Indian state of Kerala. We used the small autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) Maya with onboard sensors of dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll, turbidity, temperature, and depth to monitor the water quality environment of the Idukki Reservoir in May 2006. The use of AUVs in confined spaces like small lakes and reservoirs is new and uncommon, requiring extra safety to be implemented. As this is a prototype AUV, we shall describe in brief key aspects of the vehicle attributes namely, its novel mechanical design, the autopilots that control the heading and cruising depth, and the safety and endurance of the platform. The data acquired by Maya revealed an acute oxygen deficiency at 21 m, a mid-water low turbidity layer between 10 m and 15 m, and a prominent chlorophyll maximum in the thermocline region of Idukki waters at 6 m. These experiments were repeated a year later in May 2007 and were in unambiguouos agreement with the 2006 findings of hypoxia. These are the first observations of hypoxic processes using a small AUV in any Indian lake. The relevance of these results in freshwater systems shows similarities to hypoxia in saline coastal waters of the west coast of India and is discussed briefly.

AB This study proposes a cellular automaton model incorporating the platoon size of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) to examine their impact on mixed traffic flow. First, vehicles are classified into three modes, human-driven vehicles (HDVs), adaptive cruise control (ACC), and cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC), by considering the characteristics of the car-following behavior. Second, the CACC is further subdivided into interplatoon and intraplatoon car-following modes due to the limitations of the platoon size of CAVs. Then, cellular automaton rules are developed for each of these four modes. Finally, numerical simulation experiments are conducted to analyze the influence of the penetration rate and platoon size of CAVs on mixed traffic flow. The results demonstrate that (1) the simulation results closely align with the theoretically derived outcomes, with an error rate of only 0.46% at a penetration rate of 100%; (2) when the penetration rate of CAVs reaches 100%, increasing the platoon size further enhances the traffic capacity; and (3) the optimal platoon size is determined to be seven CAVs under moderate traffic density.

AB In this paper, a novel UAV-aided vehicular edge computing (VEC) network is proposed, where the vehicle and on-board UAV provide multi-access edge computing (MEC) service for the roadside Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In this system, considering the time-varying channel, we derive the lower bound of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) based on the first-order Gauss-Markov process. Then, with the short-packet transmission, we maximize the total amount of computation by jointly optimizing the communication scheduling, the trajectories of the vehicle and on-board UAV, and the computing resource, subject to the mobility, connection and computation constraints. The formulated optimization problem is a mix-integer non-convex problem. To efficiently solve it, we propose an alternative algorithm based on the Lagrangian dual decomposition and successive convex approximation technique. Extensive simulation results are provided to show the performance gain of the proposed algorithm.

AB Drivable ground detection contributes to the perfect navigation of unmanned vehicle systems, and this significantly attracted the attention of researchers. Various vision-based techniques have been proposed, and amazing results are accomplished towards drivable ground detection. Despite these achievements, environmental noises like snows, rains and shadows have an effect that can lead to mis-detection of drivable ground. After conducting a brief study on snow, rain and shadow, we introduce filtering algorithms into the drivable ground detection system to overcome the effect of these environmental noises. Experimental comparison was carried out qualitatively and quantitatively. Quantitative experiments were carried out using these following schemes: accuracy rate (ACC), error rate (ERR), true positive rate (TPR), false negative rate (FNR), true negative rate (TNR), false positive rate (FPR) and precision (PRE). These schemes are used for a comparison between the system with and without a filtering algorithm. The results from all experiments show improved performance of the system with a filtering algorithm over other systems, and these massively contributed to perfect navigation for the unmanned vehicle system.

AB Predicting the behaviour (i.e., manoeuvre/trajectory) of other road users, including vehicles, is critical for the safe and efficient operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs), a.k.a., automated driving systems (ADSs). Due to the uncertain future behaviour of vehicles, multiple future behaviour modes are often plausible for a vehicle in a given driving scene. Therefore, multimodal prediction can provide richer information than single-mode prediction, enabling AVs to perform a better risk assessment. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal prediction framework that can predict multiple plausible behaviour modes and their likelihoods. The proposed framework includes a bespoke problem formulation for manoeuvre prediction, a novel transformer-based prediction model, and a tailored training method for multimodal manoeuvre and trajectory prediction. The performance of the framework is evaluated using three public highway driving datasets, namely NGSIM, highD, and exiD. The results show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art multimodal methods in terms of prediction error and is capable of predicting plausible manoeuvre and trajectory modes.

DT Article
AB Whether in intelligent transportation or autonomous driving, vehicle detection is an important part. Vehicle detection still faces many problems, such as inaccurate vehicle detection positioning and low detection accuracy in complex scenes. FCOS as a representative of anchor-free detection algorithms was once a sensation, but now it seems to be slightly insufficient. Based on this situation, we propose an improved FCOS algorithm. The improvements are as follows: (1) we introduce a deformable convolution into the backbone to solve the problem that the receptive field cannot cover the overall goal; (2) we add a bottom-up information path after the FPN of the neck module to reduce the loss of information in the propagation process; (3) we introduce the balance module according to the balance principle, which reduces inconsistent detection of the bbox head caused by the mismatch of variance of different feature maps. To enhance the comparative experiment, we have extracted some of the most recent datasets from UA-DETRAC, COCO, and Pascal VOC. The experimental results show that our method has achieved good results on its dataset.

ID CURVES
AB Standard path control laws of autonomous vehicles use the shortest distance between the vehicle's position and the path as a control error. In order to determine this distance, the projection point onto the path needs to be determined continuously. This requires fast algorithms that feature high numerical reliability in the field of vehicle application.
   This paper presents two different observer-based approaches for the projection problem. The identity observer reconstructs all states of interest for path control. The second one, a reduced observer, only possesses the curve parameter as a state and calculates the other values by algebraic formulas. Both algorithms consider the continuous movement of the vehicle, the run of the curve, and work without any approximation of the curve. Furthermore, they are applicable for arbitrary parameterized smooth curves, guarantee the required numerical stability, have short calculating time, and show good statistical properties. The performance is shown in several simulations as well as under real conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the traditional ITS, the road side unit (RSU) is used as the edge server to provide computing services for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). However, the rapid growth of on-board devices creates a strain on communication resources. Thus, in this letter we investigate the application of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and mobile edge computing (MEC) in air base station (ABS)-assisted ITS. In this scenario, CAVs can partially offload tasks to RSUs and ABS simultaneously through NOMA. To further reduce total system delay, ABS can guide heavy loaded RSU to migrate tasks to achieve load balancing. We jointly optimize the transmission power and offloading decision, and model CAVs' task processing delay minimization problem as a mixed integer nonlinear problem. To solve this problem, we propose a two-step strategy. First, we obtain the optimal transmission power and task division ratio through the proposed optimal pre-offloading decision (OPD) algorithm, and then determine the offloading object through the devised subtask migration (STM) algorithm. Simulation results verify the advantages of our proposed scheme.

ID FAULT-TREE ANALYSIS; BRAKING
AB The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) reports, including disengagement and collision reports, provide information on each accident or disengagement activity for on-road testing of autonomous driving systems (ADSs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs). Unfortunately, current DMV reports have been misleading in relation to many key details, making it challenging for readers of those reports to discern the events' root causes and interrelationships. Therefore, appropriate systematic classification methods and principles need to be adopted. We follow an identification method similar to fault tree analysis (FTA) with the help of the driving reliability and error analysis method (DREAM 3.0) and the Haddon matrix to find the potential key accident factors from all disengagement data. We also conduct ADS risk assessments of potential disengagements and genuine accidents classified by traditional accident types. In addition, the automated driving system is composed of various software modules, and a classification method that is suitable from the standpoint of ADS software developers is developed in this paper. Next, we sort out the characteristics of the most frequent accidents based on the risk assessment results. Finally, we propose a workable risk reduction solution according to the characteristics of accidents.

TI Towards Accurate Ground Plane Normal Estimation from Ego-Motion

DT Article
DE ground plane normal; autonomous driving; odometry; kalman filter
AB In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for ground plane normal estimation of wheeled vehicles. In practice, the ground plane is dynamically changed due to braking and unstable road surface. As a result, the vehicle pose, especially the pitch angle, is oscillating from subtle to obvious. Thus, estimating ground plane normal is meaningful since it can be encoded to improve the robustness of various autonomous driving tasks (e.g., 3D object detection, road surface reconstruction, and trajectory planning). Our proposed method only uses odometry as input and estimates accurate ground plane normal vectors in real time. Particularly, it fully utilizes the underlying connection between the ego pose odometry (ego-motion) and its nearby ground plane. Built on that, an Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) is designed to estimate the normal vector in the sensor's coordinate. Thus, our proposed method is simple yet efficient and supports both camera- and inertial-based odometry algorithms. Its usability and the marked improvement of robustness are validated through multiple experiments on public datasets. For instance, we achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on KITTI dataset with the estimated vector error of 0.39 degrees.

AB This paper presents a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm of bio-inspired geomagnetic navigation for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). Inspired by the biological navigation behavior, the solution was proposed without using a priori information, simply by magnetotaxis searching. However, the existence of the geomagnetic anomalies has significant influence on the geomagnetic navigation system, which often disrupts the distribution of the geomagnetic field. An extreme value region may easily appear in abnormal regions, which makes AUV lost in the navigation phase. This paper proposes an improved bio-inspired algorithm with behavior constraints, for sake of making AUV escape from the abnormal region. First, the navigation problem is considered as the optimization problem. Second, the environmental monitoring operator is introduced, to determine whether the algorithm falls into the geomagnetic anomaly region. Then, the behavior constraint operator is employed to get out of the abnormal region. Finally, the termination condition is triggered. Compared to the state-of- the-art, the proposed approach effectively overcomes the disturbance of the geomagnetic abnormal. The simulation result demonstrates the reliability and feasibility of the proposed approach in complex environments.

AB Measurements of near-ice (<200 m) hydrography and near-terminus subglacial hydrology are lacking, due in large part to the difficulty in working at the margin of calving glaciers. Here we pair detailed hydrographic and bathymetric measurements collected with an autonomous underwater vehicle as close as 150m from the ice-ocean interface of the Saqqarliup sermia-Sarqardleq Fjord system, West Greenland, with modeled and observed subglacial discharge locations and magnitudes. We find evidence of two main types of subsurface glacially modified water (GMW) with distinct properties and locations. The two GMW locations also align with modeled runoff discharged at separate locations along the grounded margin corresponding with two prominent subcatchments beneath Saqqarliup sermia. Thus, near-ice observations and subglacial discharge routing indicate that runoff from this glacier occurs primarily at two discrete locations and gives rise to two distinct glacially modified waters. Furthermore, we show that the location with the largest subglacial discharge is associated with the lighter, fresher glacially modified water mass. This is qualitatively consistent with results from an idealized plume model.

AB Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is treated as an extension of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication network. IoV helps in enhancing driving aids with the help of vehicle Artificial Intelligence (AI) awareness of other vehicles and their actions. IoV is connected in an adhoc networking environment which utilizes each vehicle in the network as a node, called Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET), where the vehicles may be also connected to the public Internet. It is specifically important for the autonomous vehicles because they can instantaneously communicate with other vehicles surrounding them. In addition, safely avoiding accident prone zones is crucial in order to continue secure and smart transportation. Since the communication among various entities involved in the IoV environment is via open channel, it gives an opportunity to a passive/active adversary to intercept, modify, delete or even insert fake information during communication. It is then a serious concern for the vehicles users to determine whether the received information is genuine. In this survey paper, various security aspects, threats and attacks, network and threat models related to the IoV environment are discussed. Next, a taxonomy of security protocols is given that is essential to provide IoV data security. In particular, focus on various authentication protocols is given that is needed for mutual authentication among the involved entities in the IoV environment for secure communication. A detailed comparative analysis among various state-of-art authentication protocols proposed in the related IoV environment is provided to show their effectiveness as well as security and functionality features. Moreover, some testbeds are described that were designed and implemented for the IoV environment. In addition, some future challenges for IoV security protocols are also highlighted that are necessary to address in the future.

AB The purpose of this paper is to investigate the public's willingness to adopt autonomous shuttles for public transport. This study proposes a research framework to explain people's adoption intentions. Therefore, this study adapts and extends the value-based adoption model based on the cost-benefit theory. Using empirical data from 312 respondents in Malaysia, a structural equation model is utilized to test the hypotheses. The results indicate that perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment have a positive influence on perceived value. Furthermore, perceived value positively influences the intention to use autonomous shuttles. Perceived risk was found to have no influence on perceived value, and the relationship between perceived risk and perceived value was not moderated by personal innovativeness. To improve consumer adoption intention predictions for this complex and new technology, future research should consider incorporating additional variables. Additionally, once autonomous shuttles are introduced into the market, future studies can utilize market data for more precise analysis. This study adds to past research findings by providing a detailed understanding of the role of perceived value in the adoption of autonomous shuttles. It contributes new knowledge on consumers' psychological stance toward this emerging technology. Consequently, it serves as a valuable benchmark for further studies seeking to provide a more comprehensive understanding of consumer acceptance of autonomous shuttle services, particularly in emerging economies.

AB Interest in autonomous vehicles (AVs) has significantly increased in recent years, but despite the huge research efforts carried out in the field of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), several technological challenges must still be addressed before AVs can be extensively deployed in any environment. In this context, one of the key technological enablers is represented by the motion-planning and control system, with the aim of guaranteeing the occupants comfort and safety. In this paper, a trajectory-planning and control algorithm is developed based on a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach that is able to work in different road scenarios (such as urban areas and motorways). This MPC is designed considering imitation-learning from a specific dataset (from real-world overtaking maneuver data), with the aim of getting human-like behavior. The algorithm is used to generate optimal trajectories and control the vehicle dynamics. Simulations and Hardware-In-the-Loop tests are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and computation efficiency of the proposed approach.

AB The development of underwater robotic vehicles throughout the past 30 years has contributed significantly to various types of underwater search, survey, and recovery applications. To learn about these complex systems, the MIT Design of Ocean Systems Class of 1997 designed and built an inexpensive Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), Autolycus. The Design Class of 1998 further developed this vehicle, adding a sonar altimeter to its sensor array, as well as integrating a dead reckoning navigation system. In the spring of 1999, the design class was challenged to modify the AUV Autolycus to incorporate environment-based control and to double the vehicle's maximum controllable velocity. To succeed in these modifications, a thorough understanding of state-of-the-art AUV systems, design of new hardware and software systems, and extensive testing and evaluation of these systems were required. Results of these efforts included the addition of a five-channel sonar system, new main thrusters, and a new control algorithm used to control the new hardware. Preliminary successes in wall-following and other environment-triggered behaviors were achieved.

AB Uncertainty is a major concern in vehicle path tracking control design. The coefficients of the uncertainty bound are unknown. They are assumed to lie within prescribed fuzzy sets. First, based on the path tracking kinematic model, this article innovatively formulates the vehicle path tracking task as a constraint-following problem. Second, we put forward a deterministic adaptive robust control law with a tunable parameter to ensure the uniform boundedness and ultimate uniform boundedness of the closed-loop system. Third, an optimal scheme for the tunable parameter is proposed based on the fuzzy uncertainty. The resulting optimal robust control (ORC) minimizes a comprehensive fuzzy performance index that involves the fuzzy system performance and the control cost. The results of the CarSim-Simulink cosimulation and the hardware-in-loop experiment together show that the proposed ORC exhibits a superior path tracking performance.

AB In order to enhance the performance of vehicular communication, cluster-based hybrid DSRC/WiMAX technology plays a crucial role in creating communications between vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) (V2V). One of the main goals of this hybrid technology is to improve the user experience while also providing a wide range of communication options in high-mobility circumstances. In this paper, the authors proposed a variety of communication scenarios, and the effectiveness of a hybrid system was analysed by comparing possible physical layer features. A method of bridging between different wireless technologies has been proposed using the Common OFDM parameter and clustering mechanism. In a randomly generated clustering based vehicular communication scenario, one of the key challenges has been identified and addressed by using the concepts of sub-channelization, padding bits to match the subcarriers, packet size between the transmitter and receiver, and cluster head selection. When compared to various communication scenarios, the NS2 simulation result indicates the capability of the cluster-based hybrid DSRC-IEEE802.16d system.

AB A uniform semiglobal exponential stability (USGES) proof for a time-varying vector field guidance law used for path-following control of vehicles is presented. A sliding mode control is introduced for heading autopilot design and Lyapunov methods are used to derive the control law. The equilibrium point of the autopilot error dynamics is proven to be globally exponentially stable (GES). The main result is a time-varying vector field guidance law in cascade with the autopilot. A theorem ensures that the equilibrium point of the cascaded system is uniformly semiglobally exponentially stable. Both straight-line and curved-path path following scenarios are considered in the presence of ocean currents. Simulation studies are carried out to verify the theoretical results. The time-varying guidance laws can also be applied to vehicles in general such as aircraft, underwater vehicles, drones and autonomous vehicles. (C) 2019 European Control Association.

AB In this paper, we study a mixed traffic system moving along a single-lane open-road. This platoon includes a number of human-driven vehicles (HDVs) together with one connected and automated vehicle (CAV). The dynamics of HDVs are assumed to follow the optimal velocity model (OVM), and the acceleration of the single CAV is directly controlled by a static output-feedback controller. Due to different traffic conditions, the desired velocity of the platoon can change over time. Moreover, there are multiple system parameters that are uncertain. The ultimate goal of this work is to present a gain-scheduled robust control strategy that, with a varying desired speed, smooths the traffic flow in the presence of undesired disturbances and parametric uncertainties. In this direction, a gain-scheduled H & INFIN; static output-feedback controller is designed, and its efficiency is illustrated through numerical simulations. (C) 2022 European Control Association.

AB This paper proposes a novel approach to detect the pavement surface deterioration using tyre/road noise produced from a sensorized test-vehicle during a regular driving. The acoustic data have shown to be relevant on automatic asphalt-damage classification. In this proof of concept, four classes of bituminous road-surface states were classified, showing very promising results. The application of this technique will allow automated inspection, geolocation and prioritization of roads or street areas that may need maintenance and repair, in addition to informing drivers or autonomous vehicles about road safety conditions in order to prevent accidents.
   With this approach any vehicle can easily become an asphalt status tester with the installation of a microphone, enabling the possibility to transform any fleet of vehicles into a networked signal acquisition system that may form part of the decision support of administrations in the management and maintenance of road infrastructures, at a very low cost.

DE Autonomous driving system; active lane change; trajectory tracking;

AB In this paper, a control method for trajectory planning and tracking of an intelligent vehicle is proposed. In terms of trajectory planning, a trajectory planning method for curved lane changes is designed based on conventional lane change trajectory planning and considering the adaptive correction of road curvature. In addition, curve trajectory tracking control strategy based on model predictive control is designed. Model predictive control is suitable for multi-input and multi-output nonlinear models, and it has the advantage of considering model constraints. This type of control makes the model output more in line with vehicle dynamics characteristics and improves the trajectory tracking accuracy. Finally, the simulation shows that the method proposed in this paper can generate a reasonable curved lane-changing trajectory, and under the consideration of the vehicle dynamics constraints, the MPC algorithm is used to effectively follow the expected trajectory, so that the vehicle can change lanes smoothly.

AB This paper presents a decision processmodel for real time automated lane change and speed management in highway traffic. The presented algorithm is developed based on level-K game theory to model and predict the interaction between the vehicles. Using deep reinforcement learning, this algorithm encodes and memorizes the past experiences that are recurrently used to reduce the computations and speed up motion planning. Also, we use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) as an effective tool that is employed nowadays for fast planning in complex and dynamic game environments. This development leverages the computation power efficiently and showcases promising outcomes for maneuver planning and predicting the environment's dynamics. In the absence of traffic connectivity that may be due to either passenger's choice of privacy or the vehicle's lack of technology, this development can be extended and employed in fully-automated vehicles for real-world and practical applications.

AB Prior to realizing fully autonomous driving, human intervention is periodically required to guarantee vehicle safety. This poses a new challenge in human-machine interaction, particularly during the control authority transition from automated functionality to a human driver. Herein, this challenge is addressed by proposing an intelligent haptic interface based on a newly developed two-phase human-machine interaction model. The intelligent haptic torque is applied to the steering wheel and switches its functionality between predictive guidance and haptic assistance according to the varying state and control ability of human drivers. This helps drivers gradually resume manual control during takeover. The developed approach is validated by conducting vehicle experiments with 26 participants. The results suggest that the proposed method effectively enhances the driving state recovery and control performance of human drivers during takeover compared with an existing approach. Thus, this new method further improves the safety and smoothness of human-machine interaction in automated vehicles.

These services allow information exchange between vehicles and other communication entities (e.g., vehicles, infrastructure, pedestrians). In addition, many advanced services are envisaged to support autonomous vehicles and safety applications. Therefore, the performance requirements of such services are considered highly critical for road safety. However, all these services increase the channel load, and thus, it isn't easy to differentiate which service has a higher priority for accessing communication channels. In this paper, we focus on the classification of C-ITS services, which allows the cohabitation of all services considering the strict performance requirements for some services. The aim is to classify C-ITS services based on their packet delay requirements to define higher priority for critical services to ensure their dissemination, especially under congestion conditions. Then, we present protocols and quality of service (QoS) mechanisms that can map this classification to the available vehicular networks.

AB The maximum platoon size is a critical parameter in connected and automated vehicle (CAV) platoon configuration. However, the effect of platoon size on the transportation system has not been well-studied. This paper unveils the effect of maximum CAV platoon size in terms of road capacity and traffic flow stability. Specifically, the analytical formulations of the capacity and flow stability are developed considering the maximum platoon size. Simulations are conducted to verify the developed theoretical models. For capacity analysis, both the analytical and simulation results indicate that a larger maximum platoon size can help increase the capacity. However, the increment becomes smaller with the increase of maximum platoon size. For flow stability analysis, the theoretical analysis and microscopic simulation show that smaller maximum platoon size leads to greater traffic flow stabilization. In addition, analysis shows that improvements in capacity and traffic stability are more profound when CAV penetration and platooning intensity are high.

AB Road safety, whatever the considered environment, relies heavily on the ability to detect and track moving objects from a moving point of view. In order to achieve such a detection, the vehicle's ego-motion must first be estimated and compensated. This issue is crucial to complete a fully autonomous vehicle; this is why several approaches have already been proposed. This study presents a method, based solely on visual information that implements such a process. Information from stereo-vision and motion is derived to extract the vehicle's ego-motion. Ego-motion extraction algorithm is thoroughly evaluated in terms of precision and uncertainty. Given those statistical attributes, a method for dynamic objects detection is presented. This method relies on 3D image registration and residual displacement field evaluation. This method is then evaluated on several real and synthetic data sequences. It will be shown that it allows a reliable and early detection, even in hard cases (e.g. occlusions,...). Given a few additional factors (detectable motion range), overall performances can be derived from visual odometry performances.

AB This article presents a challenging multi-agent seasonal dataset collected by a fleet of Ford autonomous vehicles (AVs) at different days and times during 2017-2018. The vehicles traversed an average route of 66 km in Michigan that included a mix of driving scenarios such as the Detroit airport, freeways, city centers, university campus, and suburban neighborhoods. Each vehicle used in this data collection was a Ford Fusion outfitted with an Applanix POS-LV GNSS/INS system, four HDL-32E Velodyne 3D-lidar scanners, six Point Grey 1.3 MP cameras arranged on the rooftop for 360 degrees coverage, and one Point Grey 5 MP camera mounted behind the windshield for the forward field of view. We present the seasonal variation in weather, lighting, construction, and traffic conditions experienced in dynamic urban environments. We also include data from multiple AVs that were driven in close proximity. This dataset can help design robust algorithms for AVs and multi-agent systems. Each log in the dataset is time-stamped and contains raw data from all the sensors, calibration values, pose trajectory, ground-truth pose, and 3D maps. All data is available in rosbag format that can be visualized, modified, and applied using the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS). We also provide the output of reflectivity-based localization for bench-marking purposes. The dataset can be freely downloaded at .

AB It is extremely difficult to operate an underwater manipulator carried on a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in the deep sea. In order to investigate underwater manipulator operations maneuvered by a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), this paper develops a virtual underwater manipulator and its carrier, the ROV, via the three-dimensional simulator "Webots" to animate operational tasks. The ROV model refers to the structure of a typical ROV which operates below the ocean's surface down to 1000 m, while the graphical and kinematic models of the manipulator refer to a master-slave servo hydraulic manipulator with 7 functions, consisting of six degrees of freedom (DOFs) and a parallel gripper for manipulations. This study uses the virtual platform to challenge an operator to conduct different tasks by using the manipulator, including two switch-based and one master arm-based operation, and combined by remote and autonomous operations. When conducting the operations, we have considered uncertain external disturbances that stem from subsea environments. In order to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the virtual platform, we have designed two typical underwater operational tasks for training the operator: grasping a machine part in a basket, and making a circle at a specified position on the seabed. The tasks are completed by coordinating the underwater manipulator, the submersible vehicle, and a pan-tilt camera. Three operators were invited for the training operations, and their operating results are presented.

DT Article
ID DESIGN
AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (ALIVs) are widely used for marine survey, in both the coastal and deep sea areas and they are applicable to both civil and defense applications. They are pre-progrannned and can operate without human intervention and this makes them attractive to many marine industries. A concern with AUVs is the high energy consumption required by their thrusters for depth control. buoyancy change and manoeuvrability and that adversely affects their performance and endurance. This paper presents the design and development of novel stand-alone variable buoyancy system for AUVs and investigates its performance through numerical and experimental investigations. The design idea is based upon the Pump Driven Variable Buoyancy System (PDVBS) and uses a hydraulic based method to control the buoyancy. The VBS is integrated into a medium sized AUNT of 3 m length and the performance of the vehicle in vertical plane is investigated. The results are presented for a buoyancy change requirement of 5 kg and a diaphragm type positive displacement pump, with a buoyancy change rate of 5 kg/win, is utilized. Depth control performance of the AUV and its hovering capabilities, at a desired depth of 60 in using the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller, are analysed in detail. Finally, the results indicate that the designed and developed VBS is effective in changing the buoyancy and controlling the heave velocity. These two features are expected to provide higher endurance and better performance in AUVs involved in rescue/attack operations.

AB The present paper presents a fault-tolerant control for an AUV in the presence of a critical failure in the actuators that may require an emergency operation to recover it or to drive it to a safe point. In this context, the control scheme proposed deals with a single thruster in operational conditions to command the vehicle towards a desired direction and reach a safe target point. In addition, the AUV is commanded with only two control actions on the available thruster, driving the vehicle through the desired direction following a spiral-like path and keeping it within the neighbourhood of the target point. The fault-tolerant control proposed is simple and robust enough to be applied to multiple kinds of AUVs without the need of accurate parameter design. The stability and well performance of the control scheme proposed is analytically demonstrated, and simulation examples illustrate the key results derived.

ID VEHICLES
AB This article presents a generic kinematic formulation and a procedure developed to deduce the kinematics of wheeled mobile robots (WMRs), also known in the literature as driverless ground vehicles, automated guided vehicles (AGVs), and autonomous transit vehicles (ATVs). The generic formulation to deduce the kinematics of WMRs with various combinations of driving and steering wheels is obtained by making use of the transformation approach and modifying the kinematic formulations developed for WMRs with inclined steering columns. A general expression for the angular velocity of wheel slip is derived to extend the suitability of the formulations for WMRs with various combinations of driving and steering wheels. It is illustrated that the procedure developed provides the final form of the kinematic equations by providing only the kinematic parameters of the WMR, including the type of wheels employed for the generic model. This approach is useful to automate the modeling procedure to obtain either symbolic expressions or numerical values for WMR kinematics. Several case studies are presented to illustrate the simplicity of the developed approach. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB An unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV)-aided communication scenario is studied in this research, where a UAV with constrained on-board battery capacity communicates with multiple ground users (GUs) during the flying process. We investigate the UAV trajectory as well as the resource allocation to minimize the time consumption of the specific task. The formulated problem is non-convex with innumerable variables. To make this problem tractable, a collection of line segments are utilized to represent the real trajectory through discretization. The reformulated problem is solved by applying the block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm. To be specific, the reformulated problem is decoupled into two subproblems, i.e., resource allocation and trajectory optimization subproblems. The subproblems are both non-convex, which are efficiently resolved with the successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Then the result is obtained with an iterative algorithm. The simulation results reveal that, in comparison to benchmark schemes, the system performance has a significant improvement.

AB Water-obstacles detection based on semantic segmentation is an essential part of autonomous navigation of unmanned surface vehicles (USV). However, it is difficult for existing methods to ensure the real-time of water-obstacles recognition and high detection accuracy. To address this issue, we proposed novel network architecture, a lightweight water-obstacles detection network (LWDNet). In LWDNet, we adopt a novel backbone, bottleneck structure with attention block, the former decrease the model size, the latter obtain more semantic information, and then the dilated convolution has been used in depthwise separable (DW) convolution to enforce the extraction of feature information. Additionally, by using improved focal loss (weight the main and auxiliary focal loss), the water -obstacles detection accuracy increased. In order to test the real-time performance and detection accuracy of LWDNet, we use the most challenging dataset, Multi-modal Marine Obstacle Detection Dataset 2 (MODD2) dataset, for experimental validation. The experimental results show that, compared with the state-of-the-art detection methods, such as WasR and ShorelineNet, the LWDNet maintains a much faster speed of images inference (62 frames-per-second on an NVIDIA RTX 2080Ti), and at the same time, the obstacles detection performance is equally high (87.5% F-measure, 77.8% IOU). Therefore, the LWDNet is an efficient network in water-obstacles detection, making the autonomous navigation of USV more reliable.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Autonomous trajectory planning for multi-stage launch vehicles poses great technical challenges, mainly because of the highly nonlinear flight dynamics and complex multi-phase structure. Here, this problem is solved by a novel, robust, and efficient approach within the framework of convex optimization. Focusing on the multi-phase difficulty, a mass-projection technique that substitutes the original time independent variable with the mass history is introduced to eliminate the problem's discontinuous nature and phase-linkage event constraints, then a new sequential relaxation-and-penalization method is proposed to address the resulting problem. All non-convex terms involved in the problem are relaxed to formulate a certainly feasible semi-definite problem, the deviation between which and the true problem is penalized by blending the information from the trust region and semi-definite constraint. The combination of the mass-projection technique and the sequential relaxation-and-penalization method is found to be capable of recovering the original problem and providing the optimal solution rapidly and reliably. Three representative simulations are performed to verify the robustness and computational efficiency of the proposed approach, and comparative results show that it achieves a 100% success rate for all cases, while enabling a 69% to 98% saving of computational time compared to typical methods.

AB In this paper neural-network (NN) based adaptive trajectory tracking control scheme has been designed for underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) which are subjected to unknown asymmetrical actuator saturation and unknown dynamics. First, some control preliminaries and assumptions along with AUV kinematic & kinetic models and trajectory tracking problems are elaborated. Secondly, the tracking error model and tracking guidance law are derived based on the theory of relative motion and the principle of approach angle respectively. Then the kinematic controller is designed by using the backstepping technique and Lyapunov theory. Similarly, AUV kinetic controller is designed by using the NN compensation and adaptive estimation techniques which is termed as NN-based adaptive controller (NNAC). Pertinently, a novel bounded saturation function has been developed to describe the unknown asymmetrical actuator saturation. The NN is adopted to approximate the complex AUV hydrodynamics and differential of desired tracking velocities. The bound of the generalized disturbance, which is composed of NN approximation error and ocean disturbances, are approximated based on the adaptive estimation technique. To analyze the stability of the developed NNAC, Lyapunov theory and backstepping technique are utilized by considering the control actions on different saturation sections. Finally, effectiveness and superiority of the proposed NNAC are validated through two sets of comparative simulation studies.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES
AB This article presents a non-linear output feedback tracking controller deisgn for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operating in shallow water area. In a shallow water environment, significant disturbances due to shallow water waves affect the motion of marine vehicles greatly. Since it is not energy efficient to counteract the oscillatory disturbances due to waves, it is critical to obtain the wave information or wave induced disturbance information and design an energy efficient controller to reduce the action of actuators to counteract wave disturbances to avoid wear and tear on actuators. In this article, a non-linear observer is first designed to estimate the low frequency (LF) motion of AUVs and to filter out wave-frequency (WF) motion of AUVs due to shallow water wave by using position and attitude measurements. Based on the designed observer, a non-linear output feedback controller is subsequently derived by using the observer backstepping technique. By using this approach, the AUV achieves global exponential tracking without excessive energy consumption to counteract the wave disturbance and also avoids excessive wear and tear on thrusters. Global exponential stability (GES) of overall observer-controller system is proved through Lyapunov stability theory. A set of simulations is carried out by using the KAMBARA (Silpa-Anan 2001) AUV model to demonstrate the performance of the proposed observer and output feedback controller.

AB Fast-growing freight activities over the decades have become one of the major contributors to air pollution, leading to many efforts in freight decarbonization and electrification. However, the development of freight electrification is slow due to technological uncertainty, slow charging, high capital cost, etc. This paper analyzes the potential impact and benefit of heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) electrification and automation on fleet cost, infrastructure cost, the electricity grid, and environmental outcomes. In this work, we extended the vehicle electrification benefit analysis tool: Grid-Electrified Mobility (GEM) model, which had primarily been used to study light-duty passenger vehicles (LDVs), to analyze heavy-duty vehicle electrification. The extended model is derived for freight transportation electrification, and different freight electrification and automation adoption scenarios were analyzed. We find that the increased penetration of automated electric freight fleets within other types of electrified freight fleets from 1% to 99% will result in an overall cost reduction of 18.2%, fleet size reduction of 20.4%, and lower peak load reduction of 14.3%.

AB Industry 5.0 utilizes the Internet of Things (IoT) and autonomous computing to facilitate human-machine collaboration, where humans and machines coexist in a competitive economic ecosystem. In conventional workplaces, fairness is widely recognized as a driving force behind human motivation, loyalty, and productive collaboration. However, current fairness-aware task allocation methods have primarily focused on homogeneous workers, concentrating on either equity or equality as the sole fairness principle. With the rising trend of diverse worker fleets consisting of autonomous robots/vehicles and human-in-the-loop as service providers (e.g., crowdsourced logistics), novel approaches are necessary. Our contribution entails a fairness-aware task allocation approach for heterogeneous workers, leveraging the digital twin to understand the system's behavior and facilitate real-time adaptation. Our proposed solution considers equity, equality, and need, utilizing the maximum-weight bipartite matching algorithm. Multiple incentive scenarios are utilized to evaluate the potential of the approach. The experimental results suggest that our multi-objective approach yields better overall fairness in various scenarios than the baselines.

AB With the recent progress of techniques in computer vision and processor design, vehicles are able to perform a greater number of functions, and are reaching higher levels of autonomy. As the list of autonomous tasks that the car is supposed to perform grows, two design questions arise: how to group these tasks into modules and which processors and data buses should instantiate these modules and their links in the physical architecture. Both questions are linked, as the processing capacity of the processors influences how centralized the architecture can be, and the modularization influences the overall system latency as well. Furthermore, our interest lies in designing architectures that perform the tasks rapidly, while minimizing cost. This multiobjective problem is intractable without architecture exploration and an analysis tool. This paper presents a linear optimization formulation to capture these tradeoffs, and to systematically find relevant architectures with optimal latency and cost. The results show that enforcing all safety constraints on the architecture leads to a worst case increase of 17% in latency and 18% component cost per vehicle. The increase in latency is significant at the scale of human driver reaction times.

AB This paper proposes a new, fast and computationally light weight methodology to pinpoint a robot in a structured scenario.
   The localisation algorithm performs a tracking routine to pinpoint the robot's pose as it moves in a known map, without the need for preparing the environment, with artificial landmarks or beacons. To perform such tracking routine, it is necessary to know the initial position of the vehicle.
   This paper describes the tracking routine and presents a solution to pinpoint that initial position in an autonomous way, using a multi-hypotheses strategy. This paper presents experimental results on the performance of the proposed method applied in two different scenarios: (1) in the Middle Size Soccer Robotic League (MSL), using artificial vision data from an omnidirectional robot and (2) in indoor environments using 3D data from a tilting Laser Range Finder of a differential drive robot (called RobVigil).
   This paper presents results comparing the proposed methodology and an Industrial Positioning System (the Sick NAV350), commonly used to locate Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) with a high degree of accuracy in industrial environments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Intelligent vehicles have provided a variety of services; there is still a great challenge to execute some computing-intensive applications. Edge computing can provide plenty of computing resources for intelligent vehicles, because it offloads complex services from the base station (BS) to the edge computing nodes. Before the selection of the computing node for services, it is necessary to clarify the resource requirement of vehicles, the user mobility, and the situation of the mobile core network; they will affect the users' quality of experience (QoE). To maximize the QoE, we use multiagent reinforcement learning to build an intelligent offloading system; we divide this goal into two suboptimization problems; they include global node scheduling and independent exploration of agents. We apply the improved Kuhn-Munkres (KM) algorithm to node scheduling and make full use of existing edge computing nodes; meanwhile, we guide intelligent vehicles to the potential areas of idle computing nodes; it can encourage their autonomous exploration. Finally, we make some performance evaluations to illustrate the effectiveness of our constructed system on the simulated dataset.

AB This study examines how to improve the accuracy of auto parking path tracking control; therefore, a linear model predictive control with softening constraints path tracking control strategy is proposed. Firstly, a linear time-varying predictive model of vehicle is established, and the future state of the vehicle can be predicted. The designed objective function fully considers the deviation between the predictor variable and the reference variable. Also, the relaxation factors are added to the optimization process, and the control increment of each cycle is calculated by the quadratic programming. Through rolling optimization and feedback correction, all kinds of deviations in the control process can be corrected in time. Then, the Simulink/CarSim simulation is carried out jointly. Furthermore, the path tracking simulation based on proportion-integration-differentiation control and no control is also carried out to compare with the model predictive control. Finally, a real vehicle test is carried out for model predictive control algorithm, and a comparative experiment based on proportion-integration-differentiation control and no control is carried out.

DE Unmanned air vehicle; trajectory generation; trajectory optimization;

AB In this article, an algorithm for three-dimensional path generation and tracking for unmanned air vehicles in the presence of no-fly zones is proposed. The algorithm is based on a local optimization procedure aimed to find the shortest path between the waypoints in compliance with all path constraints. Vehicle structural and envelope limitations are accounted for by simple geometric constraints such as minimum curvature radius and flight path angle limitations, while no-fly zones are defined as cylindrical objects with infinite altitude. The algorithm is simple and it has a limited computational burden, at most quadratic with the number of zones to avoid. This makes the algorithm very suitable for real-time applications even in case of a high number of forbidden zones. Algorithm effectiveness has been demonstrated by means of numerical simulations in scenarios including the presence of no-fly zones not known before flight (for instance, in the case of sudden changes of weather conditions and/or detection of new fixed obstacles).

AB Monitoring water resources and their quality is an activity that is gaining more importance through the years. Efficient and intelligent monitoring systems must be developed by taking advantage of cutting edge technologies like robotic agents. The utilization of autonomous surface vehicles equipped with water quality sensors is a promising approach to continuously measure physico-chemical parameters related to water quality. However, most of current related works do not acknowledge for the increasing availability and affordability of these systems. Therefore, the current approaches do not generalize well to account for multiple objectives and the involvement of multiple agents. The present work provides one of the first approaches considering the usage of multiple agents equipped with multiple water quality sensors so that online modeling of water bodies is done. Furthermore, the measurements are done considering a Voronoi Region Partitioning system using an underlying Bayesian Optimization with multiple objectives. Results show that the system can robustly obtain very accurate surrogate models despite the limited available information and energy autonomy constraint of the vehicles. When compared with coverage and patrolling-based approaches, the proposed system outperforms these approaches on average by 23.6% and 43.5%, respectively, regarding the error of modeling. The performance of this approach is also enhanced by its robustness and scalability when compared to offline monitoring missions.

AB In the very near future, cars will be in autonomous mode most of the time, allowing drivengers (i.e., users of Level 3 automated vehicles) to do what they want until a system inoperability. This implies for the drivenger to disengage from a NDRT (Non-Driving-Related Task) to engage in the driving task within a limited time interval. This takeover period has given rise to a great deal of concern, as studies have highlighted a lack of ability to safely resume the driving activity. In addition, the increase in automation is predicted to be accompanied by a reduction in driving skills and experience. The present study looked at how drivengers prepare for takeover according to their level of driving experience. A group of drivengers (n = 25) were told to watch a movie during a 30-minute autonomous driving phase and prepare for takeover during the 18 seconds of a takeover request. A group of drivers (n = 29) performed the same drive in manual driving mode without any NDRT. We focused on the amount of attention the drivengers allocated to the resumption of the driving task versus the continuation of the NDRT, by investigating their visual behaviour between the start of the takeover request and the system being deactivated. We also evaluated their mental workload via their pupil size. We compared their eyetracking data with those of the drivers in the non-autonomous condition. Results indicated poorer visual behaviour among drivengers than among drivers. The novice drivengers' visual behaviour was the most impaired during this critical period. There was also a tendency for drivengers to experience greater mental workload than drivers during the takeover period. These results suggest that drivengers do not have sufficient attentional capacity to cope with the high demand imposed by the takeover, particularly when they are inexperienced.

AB Advancements in autonomous driving have seen unprecedented improvement in recent years. This work addresses the challenge of enhancing the navigation of autonomous vehicles in complex urban environments such as intersections and roundabouts through the integration of computer vision and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). UAVs, owing to their aerial perspective, offer a more effective means of detecting vehicles involved in these maneuvers. The primary objective is to develop, evaluate, and compare different computer vision models and reduced-board (and small-power) hardware for optimizing traffic management in these scenarios. A dataset was constructed using two sources, several models (YOLO 5 and 8, DETR, and EfficientDetLite) were selected and trained, four reduced-board computers were chosen (Raspberry Pi 3B+ and 4, Jetson Nano, and Google Coral), and the models were tested on these boards for edge computing in UAVs. The experiments considered training times (with the dataset and its optimized version), model metrics were obtained, inference frames per second (FPS) were measured, and energy consumption was quantified. After the experiments, it was observed that the combination that best suits our use case is the YoloV8 model with the Jetson Nano. On the other hand, a combination with much higher inference speed but lower accuracy involves the EfficientDetLite models with the Google Coral board.

AB Advanced driving assistance systems (ADASs) play a vital role in the safety of transportation. The detection of lane markings is a very important part of ADASs. For the safety of autonomous vehicles and vehicles driven by human drivers, accurate detection results are necessary. In this study, the authors propose a novel algorithm based on lane structural analysis and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for lane marking detection. First, a pre-processing stage is used to remove the pavement that constitutes the background of the lane markings. Next, a set of local waveforms from local images is used to generate a region of interest and a CNN classifier is employed to detect lane marking candidates. Finally, a lane geometry analysis stage determines whether or not the candidate is a part of a lane marking. The major contributions of this study can be summarised as follows. First, they propose a novel method to describe a road using waveforms. Second, they analyse the local and global characteristics of the road geometry to detect the lane markings. Third, they provide an effective method to obtain training data for the proposed machine learning method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods.

AB A smart city is an urban area that collects data using various electronic methods and sensors. Smart cities rely on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and aim to improve the quality of services by managing public resources and focusing on comfort, maintenance, and sustainability. The fifth generation (5G) of wireless mobile communication enables a new kind of communication network to connect everyone and everything. 5G will profoundly impact economies and societies as it will provide the necessary communication infrastructure required by various smart city applications. Intelligent Transporting System (ITS) is one of the many smart city applications that can be realized via 5G technology. The paper aims to discuss the impact and implications of 5G on ITS from various dimensions. Before this, the paper presents an overview of the technological context and the economic benefits of the 5G and how key vertical industries will be affected in a smart city, i.e., energy, healthcare, manufacturing, entertainment, and automotive and public transport. Afterward, 5G for ITS is introduced in more detail.

ID LIABILITY
AB Automobile accidents in the United States account for thousands of deaths and millions of dollars in personal injury and property damage claims every year. Because human error is the overwhelming cause of these accidents, the development of autonomous or self-driving vehicles is a valuable and inevitable contribution to the well-being of society.
   Tort liability in automobile accident litigation has long been based on legal principles of fault. When computers begin to drive cars, where does the blame fall and who pays for the injuries? Current state liability frameworks for automobile litigation need to be modified and supplemented with federal requirements in order to provide an equitable solution for allocating risks, costs, and responsibilities in a driverless environment. Although the continued use of personal fault-based liability schemes from state to state is ideal in the near future, once self-driving cars share the road with human drivers, certain no-fault liability systems must be removed to avoid abuse and inconsistency.
   Outside of personal injury lawsuits, a federal mandate for automobile manufacturers' products liability insurance would balance competing interests in protecting consumer interests and promoting technological and commercial development without the stifling burden of endless litigation.

AB The aim of our study is to examine how positive cognitive evaluations, anxiety-related affects, and the interplay between these two factors influence the willingness to use autonomous cars. We argue that the negative effect of anxiety as well as the interplay of positive evaluations and anxiety within the technology adoption process are contingent on a so far neglected facet of individual motivations, which plays a major role when dealing with anxiety towards unknown, yet status-laden, objects: self-enhancement. By employing a vignette-based online survey, we examined how people assess different levels of autonomous cars. Our results show that positive evaluations of benefits increase, whereas anxiety-related feelings decrease individual willingness to use autonomous cars; moreover, the positive effect of benefit evaluations diminished with increasing levels of anxiety. More importantly, self-enhancement emerged as a pivotal variable in this context: First, the negative effect of anxiety decreased with increasing levels of self-enhancement. Second, the attenuating effect of anxiety on the effects of positive evaluations was less pronounced with increasing levels of self-enhancement. Especially for people with low levels of self-enhancement motivation anxiety-related feelings (e.g., via strengthening self-efficacy beliefs) should be reduced. Moreover, self-enhancement values should be triggered when promoting autonomous cars. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Human driving decisions are the leading cause of road fatalities. Autonomous driving naturally eliminates such incompetent decisions and thus can improve traffic safety and efficiency. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great potential in learning complex tasks. Recently, researchers investigated various DRL-based approaches for autonomous driving. However, exploiting multi-modal fusion to generate perception and motion prediction and then leveraging these predictions to train a latent DRL has not been targeted yet. To that end, we propose enhancing urban autonomous driving using multi-modal fusion with latent DRL. A single LIDAR sensor is used to extract bird's-eye view (BEV), range view (RV), and residual input images. These images are passed into LiCaNext, a real-time multi-modal fusion network, to produce accurate joint perception and motion prediction. Next, predictions are fed with another simple BEV image into the latent DRL to learn a complex end-to-end driving policy ensuring safety, efficiency, and comfort. A sequential latent model is deployed to learn more compact representations from inputs, leading to improved sampling efficiency for reinforcement learning. Our experiments are simulated on CARLA and evaluated against state-of-the-art DRL models. Results manifest that our method learns a better driving policy that outperforms other prevailing models. Further experiments are conducted to reveal the effectiveness of our proposed approach under different environments and varying weather conditions.

AB Urban air mobility refers to an envisaged air taxi service, using small, autonomous, vertical-takeoff-and-landing, battery-powered electric aircraft. A conceptual design and optimization tool for urban air mobility, including vehicle, mission, and cost models, is presented in this paper. The tool uses geometric programming, a class of optimization problems with extremely fast solve times and for which global optimality is guaranteed. The tool is used to conduct a study of urban air mobility from a vehicle design perspective. Vehicle configurations with a higher lift-to-drag ratio, but a higher disk loading, generally weigh less and cost less to operate. The battery and the pilot are identified as the two main cost drivers; strategies for reducing these two costs are discussed. A case study is conducted on New York City airport transfers; trip times and costs are compared with those of current helicopter air taxi operations and with car ride-sharing. Sensitivity analyses are presented with respect to reserve requirements, mission range, and battery energy density. A battery energy density of 400Wh/kg is shown to be a critical enabling value for urban air mobility.

ID OBJECT DETECTION
AB The tremendous revolutionary progress of cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) and vehicular edge computing (VEC) technologies provide new opportunities to overcome the autonomous transportation issue of the mining electric locomotives (MELs), in which the accurate and fast detection of obstacles is crucial for the safe operation. With the VEC and C-V2X, we proposed a new high-precision obstacle detection strategy for MELs (MEL-YOLO). Firstly, we investigated the convolutional attention mechanism integrated into the path aggregation network of the Neck layer to strengthen the feature extraction capabilities. Secondly, we added a small-object oriented prediction layer in the Head to form the multi-scale feature prediction. Thirdly, we introduced a more efficient loss function to alleviate the gradient explosion problem in the feature transfer. Finally, we utilized the K-means $++$ optimization to derive the anchor boxes matchable with the dataset, which was collected and created by featuring different scenes to train validate the model. The MEL-YOLO was compressed by BN layer pruning and implemented on the edge device in a 6G/B5G based-V2X environment. Experimental results verify that the MEL-YOLO can effectively detect obstacles and significantly improve detection accuracy for small obstacles, computationally increasing mAP by 3.3% to original model, while maintaining detection speed and model size nearly unchanged.

AB Internet of underwater things (IoUT) describes the network of physical objects interconnected smartly in the underwater medium for monitoring/carrying out various underwater operations. IoUT allows a network of autonomous underwater vehicles, remotely operated underwater vehicles and underwater sensors to communicate with each other and collect, sensing, transmitting information to control centers located above the sea surface at high speed. This information can be used for various tasks like detection of tsunamis, animal health monitoring, shipwrecks discovery, crash surveying, etc. Optical beam undergoes fluctuation in its intensity due to fading effect in underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC). Fading is a phenomenon in which there is a variation in the refractive index due to salinity and temperature variations. It also refers as underwater optical turbulence. In this paper, we propose a model that best suits this degradation in the optical intensity. We analytically study the performance of spatial diversity in UOWC systems under optical heterodyne detection and intensity-modulated with direct detection schemes. We have also investigated various modulation techniques and obtained closed-form expressions for average bit error rate. We derive the closed-form expressions for probability density function and cumulative density function in terms of the Meijer-G function, which help in computing the system performance in terms of outage probability, and ergodic capacity.

AB This article deals with the task assignment problem for multiple autonomous underwater vehicles to efficiently collect underwater data from sensors. We formulate a unified framework to consistently address the heterogeneous task assignment problem (nonemergency and emergency cases) without strictly distinguishing the mixed cases. First, a unified problem, which bridges the gap between different constraints and optimization objectives of different cases, is constructed. Then, the proposed reinforced self-organizing mapping algorithm is reinforced in three aspects: the regional learning rate, the self-configuring neuron (SCN) strategy, and the workload balance mechanism. Specifically, the proposed regional learning rate comprehensively considers the individual worth of tasks and the topology to generate the regional learning rate of dynamic task regions, which consists of dynamic remaining tasks and the reconstructed topology. Based on this idea, the constructed unified problem can be solved consistently. Furthermore, the proposed SCN strategy optimizes the neuron population both in quality and quantity, and guides the update of neurons with enriched historical information to improve the mapping ability. This strategy greatly improves learning efficiency and applicability in a wide range of scenarios. Meanwhile, the proposed workload balance mechanism takes into consideration of both the work capability and consumed energy to extend the continuous working capability. The numerical results validate the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed unified task assignment framework.

AB Objectives On-demand ridesharing services are suggested to provide several benefits, such as improving accessibility and mobility, reducing drive-alone trips and greenhouse gas emissions. However, the impacts of these services on traffic crashes are not completely clear. This paper investigates the availability of Via- an on-demand ridesharing service in Arlington, TX, to identify the effects of this service on traffic crashes. We hypothesize that the launch of Via would result in more shared rides, fewer drive-alone trips and fewer traffic crashes. Methods We implement an Interrupted Time Series Analysis (ITSA) approach to study the impact of Via service availability on traffic crashes using weekly counts of all traffic crashes, the number of injuries, and serious injuries that occurred in Arlington from 2014 to 2021. Results The results show a statistically significant reduction in the weekly number of total crashes and total injuries but do not show any significant impact on the number of serious injuries. Shared Autonomous Vehicles have the potential to reduce traffic crashes caused by driver's fault. Conclusions This study reveals the potential impacts ridesharing services can have on traffic crashes and injuries in a mid-sized city. The results of this study can help decision and policymakers to understand the full potential of ridesharing services that can contribute to making relevant decisions toward creating sustainable and safer transportation systems in cities.

AB Although commuters have been identified as potential early adopters of autonomous vehicles (AVs) that can boost the adoption rate of this technology, there is a lack of knowledge on their willingness to pay (WTP) for this technology and the attitude that influences this decision. Using data from a consumer survey conducted in the United States, this study presents a comprehensive analysis of the decision to pay for AVs among commuters. An integrated choice and latent variable (ICLV) model was applied in this study, considering its robust performance in modeling choice behavior for integrating users' attitudes. The results showed that commuters with a favorable view toward multitasking tended to put a higher value on driverless cars. On the other hand, although a favorable view toward technology motivated commuters to pay more for AVs, data privacy and trust issues with the technology could outweigh this factor and discourage commuters from adopting and paying for AVs. This study also provides in-depth insights and comprehensive views on the impacts of commuters' socioeconomic and demographic attributes on the decision to pay for AVs. Notably, although age and educational attainment did not directly affect WTP behavior, they played important roles in this decision, with significant effects mediated through latent attitudes. These in-depth analyses provide useful insights that can help develop customized marketing strategies for different market segments according to their specific and unique preferences and concerns.

AB The inevitable need to develop new delivery practices in last-mile logistics arises from the enormously growing business to consumer (B2C) e-commerce and the associated challenges for logistics service providers. Autonomous delivery vehicles (ADVs) are believed to have the potential to revolutionise last-mile delivery in a way that is more sustainable and customer focused. However, if not widely accepted, the introduction of ADVs as a delivery option can be a substantial waste of resources. At present, the research on consumers' receptivity of innovations in last-mile delivery, such as ADVs, is limited. This study is the first that investigates the users' acceptance of ADVs in Germany by utilising an extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) and adapted it to the context of ADVs in last-mile delivery. Quantitative data was collected through an online survey approach (n = 501) and structural equation modelling was undertaken. The results indicate that price sensitivity is the strongest predictor of behavioural intention (i.e., user acceptance), followed by performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, perceived risk, social influence and facilitating conditions, whereas no effect could be found for effort expectancy. These findings have important theoretical and practical contributions in the areas of technology acceptance and last-mile delivery.

ID LOW-COST DESIGN; SYSTEM; OBSTACLE; TRACKING
AB We propose a steering control algorithm for autonomous backward driving in a narrow corridor. Passable spaces are detected using a stereo camera, and the steering angle is controlled by a model predictive controller (MPC). For passable space detection, an UV-disparity map is calculated from the original disparity map. Information regarding passable spaces collected by the stereo camera is used in steering control. Backward driving requires the driver's preemptive actions, which can be learned by experience because of the non-intuitive responses (the initial motion of the vehicle is opposite to the driver's steering angle input). This occurs because a backward-driving vehicle is a non-minimum phase system. One of the most popular steering control algorithms is Stanley method, which is based on the feedback of lateral displacement error and heading angle error. The method is very intuitive and works well for forward driving, but it exhibits significant undershoot for backward driving cases. Furthermore, the method does not explicitly consider any constraints on control inputs and states. We designed a steering controller based on the MPC technique that requires future information but can handle constraints explicitly. Because we have near-future information from the stereo camera under limited passable spaces, MPC can be effectively implemented. We performed several simulations and experiments to show the performance and superiority of the suggested method over a simple feedback-based control algorithm.

AB Routing decisions made by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms are affected by complex and dynamically changing topologies. A centralized routing algorithm imposes the entire computational burden on one module, and the high data dimensionality renders computation burdensome. In this letter, we develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning-based routing algorithm for a UAV swarm. The UAVs are trained in a data-driven manner to make distributed routing decisions. Factors that include channel quality, UAV movement, UAV overhead, and the extent of neighbor variation are incorporated into link quality assessment. Long short-term memory is used to improve the Actor and Critic networks, and more information on temporal continuity is added to facilitate adaptation to the dynamically changing environment. Simulations show that the proposed routing algorithm reduces data transmission delay and enhances the transmission rate compared with traditional routing algorithms.

AB Self-driving cars are on the horizon, making it necessary to consider safety assurance and homologation of these autonomously operating vehicles. In this study, we systematically review literature that proposes new methods for these areas. The available methods were categorized into a novel taxonomy, dividing them into the strategies of combinatorial testing, robustness testing and search-based testing. We analyzed the literature in regard to modeling capabilities, targeted automation subsystem, targeted driving task level and the metrics used for criticality evaluation and coverage of the scenario space. We found that there are significant differences and shortcoming in the modeling capabilities of the existing research and that methods of each strategy usually target a specific driving task level. Additionally the criticality assessment of scenario-based validation methods was examined, revealing the need for more comprehensive metrics to assess complex scenarios. The developed taxonomy furthers the understanding in different scenario-based testing approaches for automated vehicles and serves as a guide for future research.

ID TRACKING
AB The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is attracting many researchers with the emergence of autonomous or smart vehicles. Vehicles on the road are becoming smart objects equipped with lots of sensors and powerful computing and communication capabilities. In the IoV environment, the efficiency of road transportation can be enhanced with the help of cost-effective traffic signal control. Traffic signal controllers control traffic lights based on the number of vehicles waiting for the green light (in short, vehicle queue length). So far, the utilization of video cameras or sensors has been extensively studied as the intelligent means of the vehicle queue length estimation. However, it has the deficiencies like high computing overhead, high installation and maintenance cost, high susceptibility to the surrounding environment, etc. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the vehicular communication-based approach for intelligent traffic signal control in a cost-effective way with low computing overhead and high resilience to environmental obstacles. In the vehicular communication-based approach, traffic signals are efficiently controlled at no extra cost by using the pre-equipped vehicular communication capabilities of IoV. Vehicular communications allow vehicles to send messages to traffic signal controllers (i.e., vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications) so that they can estimate vehicle queue length based on the collected messages. In our previous work, we have proposed a mechanism that can accomplish the efficiency of vehicular communications without losing the accuracy of traffic signal control. This mechanism gives transmission preference to the vehicles farther away from the traffic signal controller, so that the other vehicles closer to the stop line give up transmissions. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism enhancing the previous mechanism by selecting the vehicles performing V2I communications based on the concept of road sectorization. In the mechanism, only the vehicles within specific areas, called sectors, perform V2I communications to reduce the message transmission overhead. For the performance comparison of our mechanisms, we carry out simulations by using the Veins vehicular network simulation framework and measure the message transmission overhead and the accuracy of the estimated vehicle queue length. Simulation results verify that our vehicular communication-based approach significantly reduces the message transmission overhead without losing the accuracy of the vehicle queue length estimation.

AB Navigation among pedestrians is a crucial capability of service robots; however, it is a challenge to manage time-varying environments stably. Recent deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approaches to crowd navigation have yielded numerous promising applications. However, they rely heavily on initial imitation learning and colossal positive datasets. Moreover, the difficulties in accurately localizing robots, detecting and tracking humans, representing and generalizing reciprocal human relationships restrict their deployment in real-world problems. We propose a Dreamer-based motion planner for collision-free navigation in diverse pedestrian scenarios. Our RL framework can completely learn from zero experience via a model-based DRL. The robot and humans are first projected onto a map, which is subsequently decoded into low-dimensional latent state. A predictive dynamic model in the latent space is jointly created to efficiently optimize the navigation policy. Additionally, we leverage the techniques of system identification, domain randomization, clustering and LiDAR SLAM for practical deployment. Simulation ablations and real implementations demonstrate that our motion planner outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and that the navigation system can be physically implemented in the real world.

AB Sandy beaches and the nearshore environment are dynamic coastal systems characterized by sediment mobilization driven by alternating stormy and mild wave conditions. However, this natural behavior of beaches can be altered by coastal defense structures. Repeated surveys carried out with autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) may represent an interesting tool for studying nearshore dynamics and testing the effects of mitigation strategies against erosion. We present a one-year experiment involving repeated stratigraphic and morpho-bathymetric surveys of a nearshore environment prone to coastal erosion along the Emilia-Romagna coast (NE Italy), the Lido di Dante beach, carried out between October 2020 and December 2021 using an ASV. Seafloor and subseafloor "snapshots" collected at different time intervals enabled us to delineate the seasonal variability and shed light on key controlling variables, which could be used to integrate and calibrate remote-sensing observations and modeling. The results demonstrated that repeated surveys could be successfully employed for monitoring coastal areas and represent a promising tool for studying coastal dynamics on a medium/short (years/months) timescale.

ID MULTIPLE FADING FACTORS; ALGORITHM
AB The performance of transportation systems has been greatly improved by the rapid development of connected and autonomous vehicles, of which high precision and reliable positioning is a key technology. An improved innovation adaptive Kalman filter (IAKF) is proposed to solve the vulnerability of Kalman filtering (KF) in challenging urban environments during integrated navigation. First, the algorithm uses the innovation to construct a chi-squared test to determine the abnormal measurement noise; on this basis, the update method of the measurement noise variance matrix is improved, and the measurement noise variance matrix is adaptively updated by the difference between the current innovation and the mean value of the innovation when the measurement data is abnormal so as to reflect the impact degree of the current abnormal measurement data, thus suppressing the filtering divergence and improving the positioning accuracy. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can well suppress the filtering divergence when the measurement data are disturbed. The results demonstrate that the algorithm in this paper has improved adaptiveness and stability and provides a novel idea for the development of an intelligent traffic positioning system.

AB Semantic interpretation of regions or entities is increasingly attracting the attention of scholars, owing to its vast applicability in several disciplines. In this context, modern autonomous systems are capable to semantically recognize and separate entities from camera measurements, while effectively interprete and interact with their environment in a higher level. Extending this notion, the semantic representation of the surroundings, based on satellite and ground-level data, is considered a fundamental property for self-localization, especially in the absence of any georeferencing signal. Keeping that in mind, in this article, we present a robust algorithm to locate the position of an autonomous vehicle within a georeferenced map using graph-based descriptors with semantic and metric information from both its memory and query measurements. In particular, an enhanced prerecorded satellite map is processed to compute semantic memories, whilst ground-level query views are used as a means to identify similarities and extrapolate the location of a moving vehicle. The above components are evaluated under an extensive set of experiments, revealing the robustness and accuracy of our final robot localization system.

AB Agile quadrotor flight in challenging environments has the potential to revolutionize shipping, transportation, and search and rescue applications. Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) has recently shown promising results for agile quadrotor control, but relies on highly accurate models for maximum performance. Hence, model uncertainties in the form of unmodeled complex aerodynamic effects, varying payloads and parameter mismatch will degrade overall system performance. In this letter, we propose L-1-NMPC, a novel hybrid adaptive NMPC to learn model uncertainties online and immediately compensate for them, drastically improving performance over the non-adaptive baseline with minimal computational overhead. Our proposed architecture generalizes to many different environments from which we evaluate wind, unknown payloads, and highly agile flight conditions. The proposed method demonstrates immense flexibility and robustness, with more than 90% tracking error reduction over non-adaptive NMPC under large unknown disturbances and without any gain tuning. In addition, the same controller with identical gains can accurately fly highly agile racing trajectories exhibiting top speeds of 70 km/h, offering tracking performance improvements of around 50% relative to the non-adaptive NMPC baseline.

AB In this paper, a new cooperative localization (CL) method for multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is proposed to address the problem of measurement outliers and communication packet loss caused by the harsh underwater environment. Combining the advantages of both the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), the quality of collected data can be improved by MCC and the ANFIS can be better trained. The efficacy of the proposed method in the CL of AUVs is verified by lake trial. The experimental results show that ANFIS can effectively obtain the location of AUVs based on the input data when the communication packet is lost and the combination of MCC and ANFIS provides better positioning accuracy and robustness. When the probability of measurement outliers is 2%, the proposed method reduces the averaged localization error by 80%, the standard deviation by 84%, and the maximum error difference by 73% compared with the CL method based on cubature Kalman filter(CKF). Finally, the effectiveness of this method is verified by various experiments under different measurement outliers probabilities.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; STABILITY; DESIGN
AB This paper attempts to develop a unified receding horizon optimization (RHO) scheme for the integrated path planning and tracking control of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Considering that the effective sensing range of onboard sensors is practically short, we formulate the path planning into RHO problems with the spline path template. The planned path is subsequently viewed as the state trajectory of a virtual reference system having the same kinematic and dynamic properties as the AUV's. Appropriately constructed error dynamics makes the AUV tracking control equivalent to the regulation problem of the error dynamic system, which facilitates the derivation of theoretical results via nonlinear MPC techniques. The model predictive control (MPC) tracking controller is designed so that closed-loop stability can be ensured. Due to the inherent RHO nature, both the path planning and tracking control are incorporated into an unified scheme. Simulation studies are conducted using a realistic dynamic model of the Falcon AUV, which was created in our previous experimental work. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.

AB The present study assessed the impact of task load and level of automation (LOA) on task switching in participants supervising a team of four or eight semi-autonomous robots in a simulated 'capture the flag' game. Participants were faster to perform the same task than when they chose to switch between different task actions. They also took longer to switch between different tasks when supervising the robots at a high compared to a low LOA. Task load, as manipulated by the number of robots to be supervised, did not influence switch costs. The results suggest that the design of future unmanned vehicle (UV) systems should take into account not simply how many UVs an operator can supervise, but also the impact of LOA and task operations on task switching during supervision of multiple UVs. The findings of this study are relevant for the ergonomics practice of UV systems. This research extends the cognitive theory of task switching to inform the design of UV systems and results show that switching between UVs is an important factor to consider.

AB This paper presents a system for autonomous cooperative wall building with a team of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The system was developed for Challenge 2 of the Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC) 2020. The wall-building scenario of Challenge 2 featured an initial stack of bricks and wall structure where the individual bricks had to be placed by a team of three UAVs. The objective of the task was to maximize collected points for placing the bricks within the restricted construction time while following the prescribed wall pattern. The proposed approach uses initial scanning to find a priori unknown locations of the bricks and the wall structure. Each UAV is then assigned to individual bricks and wall placing locations and further performs grasping and placement using onboard resources only. The developed system consists of methods for scanning a given area, RGB-D detection of bricks and wall placement locations, precise grasping and placing of bricks, and coordination of multiple UAVs. The paper describes the overall system, individual components, experimental verification in demanding outdoor conditions, the achieved results in the competition, and lessons learned. The presented CTU-UPenn-NYU approach achieved the overall best performance among all participants to win the MBZIRC competition by collecting the highest number of points by correct placement of a high number of bricks.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Registration methods for point clouds have become a key component of many SLAM systems on autonomous vehicles. However, an accurate estimate of the uncertainty of such registration is a key requirement to a consistent fusion of this kind of measurements in a SLAM filter. This estimate, which is normally given as a covariance in the transformation computed between point cloud reference frames, has been modelled following different approaches, among which the most accurate is considered to be the Monte Carlo method. However, a Monte Carlo approximation is cumbersome to use inside a time-critical application such as online SLAM. Efforts have been made to estimate this covariance via machine learning using carefully designed features to abstract the raw point clouds. However, the performance of this approach is sensitive to the features chosen. We argue that it is possible to learn the features along with the covariance by working with the raw data and thus we propose a new approach based on PointNet. In this work, we train this network using the KL divergence between the learned uncertainty distribution and one computed by the Monte Carlo method as the loss. We test the performance of the general model presented applying it to our target use-case of SLAM with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) restricted to the 2-dimensional registration of 3D bathymetric point clouds.

AB Current trends demonstrate coral reef health in serious decline worldwide. Some of the most well-preserved coral reefs in the Caribbean basin are located in the waters surrounding Bonaire, in the Dutch Caribbean. In many places on the leeward side on islands dominated by trade winds, the shallow reef systems extend into deeper water where they are known as Mesophotic Coral Ecosystems (MCE). Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) were used to collect geoacoustic data of these leeward reefs at multiple sites as part of an ocean exploration project. AUV swath bathymetry and side-scan sonar data were analyzed for depth, acoustic backscatter intensity, seafloor slope, and rugosity. These geomorphic metrics were then used as inputs to generate a composite synthetic index of bottom-type to delineate MCE features. A confusion matrix statistical analysis of the acoustic class map showed an overall accuracy of the acoustic classes at 66%, with accuracy of the hard coral class the highest at 83%, and the sandy-bottom class the lowest at 55. The hard coral class was also the statistically most reliable, at over 80%, with the noise class coming in as the least reliable. This morphologic habitat index is a potentially useful new tool in quantifying the extent of MCE located in proximity to Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).

AB Accurate and continuous positioning in global navigation satellite system (GNSS) deprived urban areas is crucial for autonomous vehicles and mobile mapping systems. To achieve this goal, we propose a stereo visual-inertial odometry approach using a multistate constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF). In contrast with the conventional MSCKF, in which an inertial navigation system (INS) propagates the vehicle motion, and then the propagation is corrected by measurements of salient features extracted from images of a single camera, we update the propagation with observations extracted from images of a stereo pair of cameras. This way, additional constraints across the stereo pairs of images are exploited to improve the pose estimation. Experimental results on several KITTI datasets show that the stereo MSCKF outperforms the mono one achieving an average positioning error of 0.9% of the trajectory length compared to 1.3% for the mono approach and 2.5% for INS-only integration. These results show that visualinertial odometry has a promising potential for vehicle positioning in short periods of GNSS signal outage.

SO CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS

DT Article
ID FEEDBACK-CONTROL; VEHICLE
AB An analysis of stability and chaotic dynamics is presented by a single-axis rate gyro subjected to linear feedback control loops. This rate gyro is supposed to be mounted on a space vehicle which undergoes an uncertain angular velocity omega(Z)(t) around its spin axis and simultaneously acceleration omega(X)(t) occurs with respect to the output axis. The necessary and sufficient conditions of stability and degeneracy conditions for the autonomous case, whose vehicle undergoes a steady rotation, were provided by Routh-Hurwitz theory. The stability of the nonlinear nonautonomous system was investigated by Liapunov stability and instability theorems. As the electrical time constant is much smaller than the mechanical time constant, the singularly perturbed system can be obtained by the singular perturbation theory. The Liapunov stability of this system by studying the reduced and boundary-layer systems was also analyzed. Using the Melinikov technique, we can give criteria for the existence of chaos in the gyro motion when the vehicle undergoes perturbed harmonic rotation about its spin and output axes.

DE Artificial intelligence algorithm safety; epistemic uncertainty;
   long-tail scenario; motion prediction; safe decision-making
AB Motion prediction modules are crucial for autonomous vehicles to forecast the future behavior of surrounding road users. Failures in prediction modules can mislead a downstream planner to make unsafe decisions. Currently, deep learning technology has been widely used to design prediction models due to its impressive performance. However, such models may fail in long-tail driving scenarios where the training data are insufficient or unavailable, which represents the so-called epistemic uncertainty of prediction models. This paper proposes a risk-aware decision-making (RADM) framework to handle the epistemic uncertainty arising from training the prediction model on insufficient data. First, a multi-agent prediction network with epistemic uncertainty quantification is proposed. This network uses the historical states of nearby road users, map information, and traffic lights as inputs. Then, the RADM utilizes model predictive control technique to not only process the multi-agent prediction results but also to consider the epistemic uncertainty of the prediction model. In addition, the accuracy of the established prediction model is verified on real-world driving datasets. Furthermore, the proposed RADM is evaluated on the log-replay data obtained from real-world driving logs and using the SUMO simulator, considering multiple challenging cases where pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles cross the intersection illegally. The experimental results demonstrate that RADM can reduce the driving risk and improve driving safety and supplementary videos are provided at https://github.com/SOTIF-AVLab/RADM.

AB A fault-tolerant method for stabilization and navigation of 3D heterogeneous formations is proposed in this paper. The presented Model Predictive Control (MPC) based approach enables to deploy compact formations of closely cooperating autonomous aerial and ground robots in surveillance scenarios without the necessity of a precise external localization. Instead, the proposed method relies on a top-view visual relative localization provided by the micro aerial vehicles flying above the ground robots and on a simple yet stable visual based navigation using images from an onboard monocular camera. The MPC based schema together with a fault detection and recovery mechanism provide a robust solution applicable in complex environments with static and dynamic obstacles. The core of the proposed leader-follower based formation driving method consists in a representation of the entire 3D formation as a convex hull projected along a desired path that has to be followed by the group. Such an approach provides non-collision solution and respects requirements of the direct visibility between the team members. The uninterrupted visibility is crucial for the employed top-view localization and therefore for the stabilization of the group. The proposed formation driving method and the fault recovery mechanisms are verified by simulations and hardware experiments presented in the paper.

Research vessels, remote sensors, and networked in situ sensing platforms (fixed and drifting) are often limited in availability, capability, and/or adaptability, with the result that surveys can not be rapidly conducted in areas of immediate concern to communities, industry, and military defense. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have been evolving over the past decade, with the ability to provide rapid environmental assessment as one of the primary objectives. However, the trade-off of cost and capability limited early designs and prohibited broad and effective utilization of these platforms for environmental data-collection missions. AUVs capable of sustained performance for sampling dynamic parameters in areas of high spatial and temporal variability were too costly, both in terms of procurement and operation, and lower cost AUVs did not have sufficient performance for operating in these challenging near-shore conditions. The development of low-cost, lightweight vehicles for these missions has only recently occurred, enabling responsive multi-platform surveys to capture synoptic characterizations of near-shore waters with sufficient resolution to support data-centric 3-D models and provide baseline data sets for development and validation of physics-based forecasting models. Recent survey operations with one candidate class of AUVs developed by OceanServer Technology, Inc. reveal the hardware/software status of state-of-the-art designs and provide a basis for developing survey strategies essential to effective mission planning.

TI A Platooning Strategy for Automated Vehicles in the Presence of Speed
   Limit Fluctuations
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English

ID ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; STABILITY
AB Platooning is expected to enhance the efficiency of operating automated vehicles. The positive impacts of platooning on travel time reliability, congestion, emissions, and energy consumption have been shown for homogenous roadway segments. However, the transportation system consists of inhomogeneous segments, and understanding the full impacts of platooning requires investigation in a realistic setup. One of the main reasons for inhomogeneity is speed limit fluctuations. Speed limit changes frequently throughout the transportation network, due to safety-related considerations (e.g., changes in geometry and workzone operations) or congestion management schemes (e.g., speed harmonization systems). In the current transportation systems with human-driven vehicles, these speed drops can potentially result in shockwave formation, which can cause travel time unreliability. Automated vehicles, however, have the potential to prevent shockwave formation and propagation and, therefore, enhance travel time reliability. Accordingly, this study presents a constant time headway strategy for automated vehicle platooning to ensure accurate tracking of any velocity profile in the presence of speed limit fluctuations. The performance of the presented platooning strategy is compared with Gipps' car-following model and intelligent driver model, as representatives of regular non-automated vehicles. Simulation results show that implementing a fully autonomous system prevents shockwave formation and propagation, and enhances travel time reliability by accurately tracking the desired velocity profile. Moreover, the performance of platoons of regular and automated vehicles is investigated in the presence of a speed drop. The results show that as the market penetration rate of automated vehicles increases, the platoon can track the velocity profile more accurately.

AB Accurately calibrating camera-LiDAR systems is crucial for achieving effective data fusion, particularly in data collection vehicles. Data-driven calibration methods have gained prominence over target-based methods due to their superior adaptability to diverse environments. However, current data-driven calibration methods are susceptible to suboptimal initialization parameters, which can significantly impact the accuracy and efficiency of the calibration process. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a novel general model for the camera-LiDAR calibration that abstracts away the technical details in existing methods, introduces an improved objective function that effectively mitigates the issue of suboptimal parameter initialization, and develops a multi-level parameter optimization algorithm that strikes a balance between accuracy and efficiency during iterative optimization. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigates the effects of suboptimal initial calibration parameters, achieving highly accurate and efficient calibration results. The suggested technique exhibits versatility and adaptability to accommodate various sensor configurations, making it a notable advancement in the field of camera-LiDAR calibration, with potential applications in diverse fields including autonomous driving, robotics, and computer vision.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) may deviate from their predetermined trajectory in underwater currents due to the complex effects of hydrodynamics on their maneuverability. Model-based control methods are commonly employed to address this problem, but they suffer from issues related to the time-variability of parameters and the inaccuracy of mathematical models. To improve these, a meta-learning and self-adaptation hybrid approach is proposed in this paper to enable an underwater robot to adapt to ocean currents. Instead of using a traditional complex mathematical model, a deep neural network (DNN) serving as the basis function is trained to learn a high-order hydrodynamic model offline; then, a set of linear coefficients is adjusted dynamically by an adaptive law online. By conjoining these two strategies for real-time thrust compensation, the proposed method leverages the potent representational capacity of DNN along with the rapid response of adaptive control. This combination achieves a significant enhancement in tracking performance compared to alternative controllers, as observed in simulations. These findings substantiate that the AUV can adeptly adapt to new speeds of ocean currents.

AB In this paper, an efficient approach for traffic sign detection, classification, and localization is introduced. An integration of the tiling technique with the RetinaFace model and the MobileNetV1-SSD was proposed for traffic detection and classification. The combination of the extraction of the region of interest with a depth estimation model, namely the AANet+, was introduced for the traffic sign localization task. All models were developed based on the transfer learning technique and existing datasets, including the Zalo and ApolloScape datasets. The accuracy and the computational efficiency of the approach are evaluated. Experimental results show that the novel traffic sign detection and classification method outperform the existing ones with an average precision of 77.2%. Moreover, the computing performance achieved is 5 FPS on Jetson Nano and 50 FPS on Jetson Xavier. For the traffic sign localization, the relative error can be reduced to 3.78%, and the computing time is 1.965 s/pair on Jetson Nano and 0.128 s/pair on Jetson Xavier, while the existing method has lower accuracy and is more time-consuming.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL
AB Neural networks have been increasingly employed in Model Predictive Controller (MPC) to control nonlinear dynamic systems. However, MPC still poses a problem that an achievable update rate is insufficient to cope with model uncertainty and external disturbances. In this letter, we present a novel control scheme that can design an optimal tracking controller using the neural network dynamics of the MPC, making it possible to be applied as a plug-and-play extension for any existing model-based feedforward controller. We also describe how our method handles a neural network containing history information, which does not follow a general form of dynamics. The proposed method is evaluated by its performance in classical control benchmarks with external disturbances. We also extend our control framework to be applied in an aggressive autonomous driving task with unknown friction. In all experiments, our method outperformed the compared methods by a large margin. Our controller also showed low control chattering levels, demonstrating that our feedback controller does not interfere with the optimal command of MPC.

AB Trajectory prediction is one of the core functions of autonomous driving. Modeling spatial-aware interactions and temporal motion patterns for observed vehicles are critical for accurate trajectory prediction. Most recent works on trajectory prediction utilize recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model temporal patterns and usually need convolutional neural networks (CNNs) additionally to capture spatial interactions. Although Transformer, a multi-head attention-based network, has shown its notable ability in many sequence-modeling tasks (e.g., machine translation in natural language processing), it has not been explored much in trajectory prediction. This paper presents a Spatial Interaction-aware Transformer-based model, which uses the multi-head self-attention mechanism to capture both interactions of neighbor vehicles and temporal dependencies of trajectories. This model applies a GRU-based encoder-decoder module to make the prediction. Besides, different from methods considering the spatial interactions only among observed trajectories in both encoding and decoding stages, our model will also consider the potential spatial interactions between future trajectories in decoding. The proposed model was evaluated on the NGSIM dataset. Compared with other baselines, our model exhibited better prediction precision, especially for long-term prediction.

AB Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) must be robust against potential failure modes, including physical degradations and software issues, and are required to self-manage contingency actions for these failures. Physical degradations often have a significant impact on the vehicle dynamics causing irregular behavior that can jeopardize system safety and mission objectives. The paper presents a novel Behavior Tree-based autonomy architecture that includes a Fault Detection and Isolation Learning-Enabled Component (FDI LEC) with an Assurance Monitor (AM) designed based on Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) techniques. The architecture implements real-time contingency-management functions using fault detection, isolation and reconfiguration subsystems. To improve scalability and reduce the false-positive rate of the FDI LEC, the decision-making logic provides adjustable thresholds for the desired fault coverage and acceptable risk. The paper presents the system architecture with the integrated FDI LEC, as well as the data collection and training approach for the LEC and the AM. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture using a simulated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) based on the BlueROV2 platform.

AB A hybrid bio-inspired self-organizing map neural network algorithm is proposed for path planning and task assignment for a multi-autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) system within a mixed (dynamic and static) three-dimensional (3D) environment. A 3D hybrid bio-inspired neural network model is established to represent the underwater environment and the distribution of the neuron pheromone content gradually diffusing, centered on the source point of the neural wave. Through self-regulation of the neural wave diffusion, the targets can achieve self-adaptive capabilities. "Multiple Newton interpolation" is used to identify the real target among interference targets, and the multi-AUV system transitions from tracking the false target to tracking the real target. Based on the principle of AUV individual kinematics, a velocity vector synthesis algorithm is proposed to overcome the interference of ocean currents. Simulation studies performed in five different environments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has high adaptability, and the potential for wide application because its neural waves can be updated in real time.

AB In order to overcome the disadvantages of some existing autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), such as actuator extraposition and degree-of-freedom (DOF) redundancy, a 2-DOF vector propeller propulsion system with built-in actuator based on the deficient DOF parallel mechanism is proposed. The RS+2PRS (Revolute-Spherical+Prismatic-Revolute-Spherical) parallel mechanism is used as the main structure, and the driving parts are placed in the interior of the AUV cabin, which is beneficial to the sealing and protection of the propulsion system. In addition, the motion parameters decoupling shows that the two independent parameters are the precession angle and the nutation angle of the propeller installation platform. Therefore, the attitude control algorithm uses two prismatic joints as driving units to establish the nonlinear mapping model with the two Euler attitude angles. In the end, the simulation analysis and the real device are used to verify the feasibility of the attitude control algorithm and the in situ adjustment function of the propeller, which lays the theoretical foundation for engineering applications in the future.

AB The potential for using synergistic combinations of measurements from autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and output from three-dimensional numerical models for studying the central California coastal region is demonstrated. Two case studies are used to illustrate the approach. In the first, propeller-driven AUV observations revealed a subsurface salinity minimum in northern Monterey Bay. A Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) reanalysis of the three-dimensional flow in the region suggested an offshore source for this water and particular propagation pathways from the south and west into the bay. In the second case study, the effectiveness of assimilating observations in improving the ROMS reanalysis fields is investigated. A significant improvement, especially in the salinity fields, is demonstrated through a single glider deployed outside the intensive observational domain. These results suggest that investigation of more sophisticated techniques for using data and models together is warranted. Such techniques include increasing model resolution in areas of interest identified by observing platforms and using model-based "targeted observing'' techniques to identify areas of uncertainty in the flow to guide placement of observational assets.

AB Deep understanding the special nature of underwater topography plays an important role for Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT). Nowadays, underwater topography scanning with autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has been becoming the chief methodology of knowing seabed topography and geomorphology. How to design topography scanning trajectory can be mathematically described as a full coverage path planning (CPP) problem. In this article, facing the complete CPP problem of mobile AUV, a new strategy based on bio-inspired neural network (BINN) algorithm with improved activity value of each neuron is discussed in detail. The original activity value function in BINN is instead of a piecewise linear function to reduce computational complexity. In addition, to overcome traditional dead-zone problem, an A* path planning-based dead-zone escape method along the shorter path as early as possible to the recently uncovered area is described in deep. Extensive simulation results and practical experiments verify the performance of proposed Improved BINN (IBINN in short)-based algorithm.

AB On-road behavior analysis is a key task required for robust autonomous vehicles. Unlike traditional perception tasks, this paper aims to achieve a high-level understanding of road agent activities. This allows better operation under challenging contexts to enable better interaction and decision-making in such complex environments. In this paper, we tackle the problem of discriminating spatio-temporal features that capture the visual instants that require more attention. We propose a new approach called STAF (Spatio-Temporal Attention Framework) through Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layers that uses a multi-head attention mechanism on its past cell state to focus on attributes that are relevant over time. Experiments have been carried out on two different scenarios over data from Joint Attention in Autonomous Driving (JAAD) and Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset (HDD), both datasets devoted to understanding the behavior of road agents. The evaluation and results obtained proof that the proposed "STAF" is outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms-based LSTM (Ramanishka, Rasouli, and LSTM-baseline). For example, STAF outperforms LSTM with mean Average Precision (mAP) of 13%.

AB The ocean bottom flying node (OBFN) is a special autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for seabed resource exploration. In this article, unmodeled uncertainties, thruster faults, and ocean disturbances are considered. The trajectory errors are constrained. Based on the directed topology, the distributed finite-time fault-tolerant error constraint containment control problem for multiple OBFN systems is solved, while only a part of follower OBFNs can measure the state of leaders. By using the backstepping method and a tan-type barrier lyapunov function (BLF), a novel form of virtual controller is constructed. Neural network is employed to approximate and compensate the general disturbances. And the upper bound of the estimation error is dealt with by proposing an adaptive law. Besides, the trajectory errors can be constrained to a small neighborhood of zero in finite time. In other words, follower OBFNs can reach the convex hull consisted of leaders in finite time. The effectiveness of the designed algorithm is shown by presenting numerical experiment.

AB Semantic information provides a valuable source for scene understanding around autonomous vehicles in order to plan their actions and make decisions. However, varying weather conditions reduce the accuracy of the semantic segmentation. We propose a method to adapt to varying weather conditions without supervision, namely without labeled data. We update the parameters of a deep neural network (DNN) model that is pre-trained on the known weather condition (source domain) to adapt it to the new weather conditions (target domain) without forgetting the segmentation in the known weather condition. Furthermore, we don't require the labels from the source domain during adaptation training. The parameters of the DNN are optimized to reduce the distance between the distribution of the features from the images of old and new weather conditions. To measure this distance, we propose three alternatives: W-GAN, GAN and maximum-mean discrepancy (MMD). We evaluate our method on various datasets with varying weather conditions. The results show that the accuracy of the semantic segmentation is improved for varying conditions after adaptation with the proposed method.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a primary role in a plethora of technical and scientific fields owing to their wide range of applications. In particular, the provision of emergency services during the occurrence of a crisis event is a vital application domain where such aerial robots can contribute, sending out valuable assistance to both distressed humans and rescue teams. Bearing in mind that time constraints constitute a crucial parameter in search and rescue (SAR) missions, the punctual and precise detection of humans in peril is of paramount importance. The paper in hand deals with real-time human detection onboard a fully autonomous rescue UAV. Using deep learning techniques, the implemented embedded system was capable of detecting open water swimmers. This allowed the UAV to provide assistance accurately in a fully unsupervised manner, thus enhancing first responder operational capabilities. The novelty of the proposed system is the combination of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) techniques and computer vision algorithms for both precise human detection and rescue apparatus release. Details about hardware configuration as well as the system's performance evaluation are fully discussed.

AB Semantic segmentation is a fundamental capability for autonomous vehicles. With the advancements of deep learning technologies, many effective semantic segmentation networks have been proposed in recent years. However, most of them are designed using RGB images from visible cameras. The quality of RGB images is prone to be degraded under unsatisfied lighting conditions, such as darkness and glares of oncoming headlights, which imposes critical challenges for the networks that use only RGB images. Different from visible cameras, thermal imaging cameras generate images using thermal radiations. They are able to see under various lighting conditions. In order to enable robust and accurate semantic segmentation for autonomous vehicles, we take the advantage of thermal images and fuse both the RGB and thermal information in a novel deep neural network. The main innovation of this letter is the architecture of the proposed network. We adopt the encoder-decoder design concept. ResNet is employed for feature extraction and a new decoder is developed to restore the feature map resolution. The experimental results prove that our network outperforms the state of the arts.

AB Currently, there is a plethora of solutions regarding interconnectivity and interoperability for networked robots so that they will fulfill their purposes in a coordinated manner. In addition to that, middleware architectures are becoming increasingly popular due to the advantages that they are capable of guaranteeing (hardware abstraction, information homogenization, easy access for the applications above, etc.). However, there are still scarce contributions regarding the global state of the art in intermediation architectures for underwater robotics. As far as the area of robotics is concerned, this is a major issue that must be tackled in order to get a holistic view of the existing proposals. This challenge is addressed in this paper by studying the most compelling pieces of work for this kind of software development in the current literature. The studied works have been assessed according to their most prominent features and capabilities. Furthermore, by studying the individual pieces of work and classifying them several common weaknesses have been revealed and are highlighted. This provides a starting ground for the development of a middleware architecture for underwater robotics capable of dealing with these issues.

TI A Computer Vision System for Lateral Localization
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
ID LANE; TRACKING
AB For urban driving, knowledge of ego-vehicle's position is a critical piece of information that enables advanced driver-assistance systems or self-driving cars to execute safety-related, autonomous driving maneuvers. This is because, without knowing the current location, it is very hard to autonomously execute any driving maneuvers for the future. The existing solutions for localization rely on a combination of a Global Navigation Satellite System, an inertial measurement unit, and a digital map. However, in urban driving environments, due to poor satellite geometry and disruption of radio signal reception, their longitudinal and lateral errors are too significant to be used for an autonomous system. To enhance the existing system's localization capability, this work presents an effort to develop a vision-based lateral localization algorithm. The algorithm aims at reliably counting, with or without observations of lane-markings, the number of road-lanes and identifying the index of the road-lane on the roadway upon which our vehicle happens to be driving. Tests of the proposed algorithms against intercity and interstate highway videos showed promising results in terms of counting the number of road-lanes and the indices of the current road-lanes.

AB This paper presents the application of the proposed autopilot and navigation system to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The autopilot is based on fuzzy control and the, navigation system is composed of a single antenna global positioning system (GPS) and gyroscopes, which implies that no other inertial navigation system (INS) is needed for this system. The autopilot consists of four fuzzy logic controllers, which control the altitude, pitch, heading, and roll respectively, and it is capable of performing waypoint navigation and trajectory following. The navigation system supplies the position and the estimated attitude of the aircraft. The estimated attitude is fused from the angular rates measured by the gyroscopes and the pseudo-attitude derived from the GPS velocity solution, and this fusion is via the quaternion-based extended Kalman filter (EKF). Ultimately, the feasibility and performance of the resulting autopilot and navigation system are verified through flight simulation of the SP-80 UAV. The simulation results demonstrate the successful autonomous flight of this UAV, using the autopilot and navigation system, even under the influence of wind disturbance.

AB Patchiness or spatial variability is ubiquitous in marine systems. With increasing anthropogenic impacts to coastal resources and coastal systems being disproportionately large contributors to ocean productivity, identifying the spatial scales of this patchiness, particularly in coastal waters, is of critical importance to understand coastal ecosystem dynamics. The current work focuses on fine scale structure in three coastal regions. More specifically, we utilize variogram analyses to identify sub-kilometer scales of variability in biological and physical parameters measured by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the Mid-Atlantic Bight, Monterey Bay, and in San Luis Obispo Bay between 2001 and 2004. Critical scales of variability in density, turbidity, fluorescence, and bioluminescence are examined as a function of depth and distance offshore. Furthermore, the effects of undersampling are assessed using predictive error analysis. Results indicate the presence of scales of variability ranging from 10s to 100s of meters and provide valuable insight for sampling design and resource allocation for future studies.

AB To overcome the shortcomings of traditional methods for underwater target detection in sonar images, a novel target detection algorithm based on deep learning is proposed for the real-time detection for an autonomous underwater vehicle equipped with a side scan sonar (SSS). First, the preprocessing of raw SSS images and data augmentation methods are proposed to improve the quality and quantity of the data set. Second, to improve the detection efficiency, a method based on threshold segmentation and pixel importance value is used to quickly determine whether there are suspected targets in the SSS images. Then, an MA-YOLOv7 network based on YOLOv7 with multi-scale information fusion and an attention mechanism is proposed to detect targets in the screened images, and a target localization method is proposed to obtain the location (latitude and longitude) of the target. Finally, the algorithm is verified through simulation experiments and field tests. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance and can be applied to real un-derwater tasks with a detection recall of 0.836 and time consumption of 0.355 s per image.

AB This paper deals with a method for performance calculation of shuttle-based storage and retrieval system (SBS/RS) with tier-captive aisle-changing shuttles and different storage strategies. The shuttles are assigned to a certain number of aisles in this system. The invented approach takes place in the design process of SBS/RS. A continuous time open-queueing system with a limited capacity approach is applied. A discrete spatial value approach determines the inter-arrival times and service times. A probability-based model mentions the aisle changing. This approach is validated by comparison to a Monte-Carlo simulation. A European material handling provider gave the data used in this comparison to validate this approach. Finally, an example of the usage in the design process of SBS/RS of the invented analytical approach is depicted. The result is an increase in throughput with an increasing number of aisles per shuttle. Likewise, the storage strategy greatly influences the throughput between random storage and retrieval and same aisle storage and retrieval.

AB This work mainly focuses on fleet collaborative control for autonomous mining fleets. In this paper, we first developed a double-layer coupling model including the intersection platoon (IP) in the upper layer and the following platoon (FP) in the lower layer and unified the headway calculation and the structure of the control problem of the two types of platoons. Then, the constant time headway (CTH) spacing policy is implemented to ensure safety during fleet operation. Next, a controller based on the sequential distributed model predictive control (SEQ_DMPC) algorithm is proposed to solve the platoon control problem. To verify the proposed controller, we built a second-order electric truck longitudinal dynamics model as the actuators and verified the accuracy of the model. Next, we assume that all trucks are permitted to implement optimization simultaneously at each time step in the simulation and verify the platoon following stability based on the electric truck dynamic model. Finally, we simulated the fleet production process, and the results show that the proposed controller performs well in all aspects.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES; MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS; LOCALIZATION; LEADER
AB This paper investigates the bearing-based formation tracking control problem of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), where the linear velocity and actuator constraints are considered. Different from the existing control methods for AUVs, position or relative position measurements are not required in our work. A leader-follower structure is adopted, where the leaders move with a time-varying and unknown linear velocity in the earth-fixed frame. We propose a consensus-based orientation estimator and an adaptation law for estimating the leaders' linear velocity in the leaders' common body-fixed frame, respectively. Then, a bearing-based formation tracking controller is designed for the followers to track the leaders and achieve the desired formation shape. Using cascade system theories, the global asymptotic stability of the overall system is rigorously analyzed. Furthermore, the estimator gains and controller gains are determined by the proposed optimal gains tuning method such that the prescribed performance criteria are optimized while satisfying the linear velocity and actuator constraints. Hence, stability, optimality, and feasibility are all achieved. Some simulation results are also given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

AB To solve the effect of unreliable acoustic range measurements in cooperative localization of autonomous underwater vehicles, a novel localization method is proposed by using a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm that consists of the adaptive quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (AQPSO) algorithm combined with the genetic algorithm (GA) to train the adaptive neurofuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model. The method can predict the acoustic ranging errors online, then correct the measurements, and improve the accuracy and stability of the cooperative localization system. We first tested the optimization ability of AQPSO-GA with an open-source dataset, and then, a large number of simulation experiments are performed with actual data collected in lake-water trials to fully compare and analyze the performance of various cooperative localization methods. The experimental results show that, compared with the cooperative localization method based on the cubature Kalman filter, the proposed method can reduce the localization error by 90% and effectively guarantee the stability of the cooperative localization system.

AB This article focuses on feature-based underwater localization and navigation for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) using 2-D imaging sonar measurements. The sparsity of underwater acoustic features and the loss of elevation angle in sonar images may introduce wrong feature matches or insufficient features for optimization-based underwater localization (i.e., underconstrained/degeneracy cases). This motivates us to propose a novel inertial-aided sliding window optimization framework to improve the estimation accuracy and the robustness to front-end outliers. Concretely, we first discriminate underconstrained/well-constrained sonar frames and define sonar keyframes (SKFs) based on the Jacobian matrix derived from odometry and sonar measurements. To utilize the past well-constrained SKFs mostly, we design a size-adjustable windowed back-end optimization scheme based on singular values. We also prove that the landmark triangulation failure (navigation problem) caused by sonar motion can be solved in 2-D scenes. Comparative simulation and evaluation on a public dataset show that the proposed method outperforms the existing ones in pose estimation and robustness even without loop closure and also ensures the real-time performance for online applications.

AB The finite-time formation tracking control is investigated for a multi-agent system (MAS) with obstacle avoidance. For the collision and obstacle avoidance problem in the formation process, the artificial potential field is used as the formation planning design, and the virtual structure is adopted to improve the organizational ability of the formation. The trajectory tracking control follows the back-stepping scheme, and the finite-time technique is developed in the control design. Considering the dynamics uncertainty of the agent system, a neural network is applied for estimating and the prediction error-based adaptive law is established to achieve the precise estimation performance. Moreover, the predefined performance function is embedded to satisfy the output constraint. The uniformly ultimate boundedness of the system error signals and the finite-time convergence of the MAS are guaranteed. The simulation study is performed to validate the proposed control for multiple autonomous underwater vehicles system, while the results manifest that the obstacle avoidance with high-precision tracking and formation performance will be achieved under the formation trajectory tracking controller.

AB This article presents an automatic real-time object detection method using sidescan sonar (SSS) and an onboard graphics processing unit (GPU). The detection method is based on a modified convolutional neural network (CNN), which is referred to as self-cascaded CNN (SC-CNN). The SC-CNN model segments SSS images into object-highlight, object-shadow, and seafloor areas, and it is robust to speckle noise and intensity inhomogeneity. Compared with typical CNN, SC-CNN utilizes crop layers which enable the network to use local and global features simultaneously without adding convolution parameters. Moreover, to take the local dependencies of class labels into consideration, the results of SC-CNN are postprocessed using Markov random field. Furthermore, the sea trial for real-time object detection via the presented method was implemented on our autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) named SAILFISH via its GPU module at Jiaozhou Bay Bridge, Qingdao, China. The results show that the presented method for SSS image segmentation has obvious advantages when compared with the typical CNN and unsupervised segmentation methods, and is applicable in real-time object detection task.

AB Autonomous rail transit (ART) vehicle is a new type of urban rail transportation, which has good development prospects. It is powered by onboard supercapacitors, which are charged at midway stations. It requires short charging time and fast charging speed. Usually, multiple chargers are used in parallel for charging. However, this will cause an overshoot phenomenon during charging, and the overshoot of multiple chargers will be superimposed on the supercapacitor, affecting the stability and life of both supercapacitors and chargers. In this paper, we propose a predictive set point modulation charging method, which can reduce the system's overshoot and increase the reliability of the system. First, the state-space averaging method is used to establish the electronic physical model of the multicharger system. Secondly, a predictive set point modulation charging control method is designed, and the closed-loop model of the proposed charging system is developed using the buck diagram. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through extensive simulation and experiments. The experimental results show that compared with the classical design method, the proposed method can effectively suppress the current overshoot.

AB This letter reports the sea experiments of a navigation method for multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that relies on a single high-performance AUV, which can estimate its self-state (position and pose) accurately without any support. In the method, there is a parent AUV and child AUVs. While the latter have minimal navigational sensors, such as a microelectromechanical gyro, a single-axis fiber optic gyro and cameras, the former can estimate its self-state without any support using high-grade navigational sensors, such as an inertial navigation system and a Doppler velocity log. As all the AUVs have acoustic positioning and communication devices, the child AUVs can also estimate their self-state as accurately as the parent AUV; thanks to relative positioning with the parent AUV. We performed the sea experiments in a hydrothermal vent field using AUVs. Post-processing state estimation using sensor data from the experiments showed that the proposed method can realize long-distance navigation while maintaining an accuracy more than five times that for navigation independently performed by a child AUV.

AB Road-boundary detection is an integral and important, function in advanced driver-assistance systems and autonomous vehicle navigation systems. A prominent feature of roads in urban, semi-urban, and similar environments, such as in theme parks, campus sites, industrial estates, science parks, and the like, is curbs on either side defining the road's boundary. Although vision is the most common and popular sensing modality used by researchers and automotive manufacturers for road-lane detection, it can pose formidable challenges in detecting road curbs under poor illumination, bad weather, and complex driving environments. This paper proposes a novel method based on extended Kalman filtering for fast detection and tracking of road curbs using successive range/bearing readings obtained from a scanning two-dimensional ladar measurement system. As compared with millimeter wave radar methods reported in the literature, the proposed technique is simpler and computationally more efficient. This is the first of its kind reported in the literature. Qualitative experimental results are presented from the application of the technique to a campus site environment to demonstrate the viability, effectiveness, and robustness.

AB Trust in an automated vehicle system (AVs) can impact the experience and safety of drivers and passengers. This work investigates the effects of speech to measure drivers' trust in the AVs. Seventy-five participants were randomly assigned to high-trust (the AVs with 100% correctness, 0 crash, and 4 system messages with visual-auditory TORs) and low-trust group (the AVs with a correctness of 60%, a crash rate of 40%, 2 system messages with visual-only TORs). Voice interaction tasks were used to collect speech information during the driving process. The results revealed that our settings successfully induced trust and distrust states. The corresponding extracted speech feature data of the two trust groups were used for back-propagation neural network training and evaluated for its ability to accurately predict the trust classification. The highest classification accuracy of trust was 90.80%. This study proposes a method for accurately measuring trust in automated vehicles using voice recognition.

AB Small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant interest in the last decade. More specifically these vehicles have the capacity to impact package delivery logistics in a disruptive way. This paper reviews research problems and state-of-the-art solutions that facilitate package delivery. Different aerial manipulators and grippers are listed along with control techniques to address stability issues. Landing on a platform is next discussed which encompasses static and dynamic platforms. Landing on a dynamic platform presents further challenges. This includes delayed control responses and poor precision of the relative motion between the platform and the aerial vehicle. Subsequently, risks such as weather conditions, state estimation, and collision avoidance to ensure safe transit is considered. Finally, delivery UAV routing is investigated which categorizes the topic into two areas: drone operations and drone-truck collaborative operations. Additionally, we compare the solutions against design, environmental, and legal constraints.

AB This paper applies a dynamic path planning and model predictive control (MPC) to simulate self-driving and parking for an electric van on a hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) platform. The hardware platform is a simulator which consists of an electric power steering system, accelerator and brake pedals, and an Nvidia drive PX2 with a robot operating system (ROS). The vehicle dynamics model, sensors, controller, and test field map are virtually built with the PreScan simulation platform. Both manual and autonomous driving modes can be simulated, and a graphic user interface allows a test driver to select a target parking space on a display screen. Three scenarios are demonstrated: forward parking, reverse parking, and obstacle avoidance. When the vehicle perceives an obstacle, the map is updated and the route is adaptively planned. The effectiveness of the proposed MPC is verified in experiments and proved to be superior to a traditional proportional-integral-derivative controller with regards to safety, energy-saving, comfort, and agility.

AB Impaired drivers have deteriorated driving performances that may greatly endanger the road safety. It is challenging to design assistance controllers for the impaired drivers because the impaired driver behaviors are difficult to be modeled and considered in the controller design. To this end, this paper proposes a gain-scheduling composite nonlinear feedback (GCNF) controller to assist the impaired drivers. A driver-vehicle system containing the impaired driver model is developed. The steering behaviors of the impaired drivers are described by deteriorating the driver model parameters and including the driver uncertainties. Based on the driver-vehicle system, a GCNF controller integrating the gain-scheduling technique, the weighted
   H infinity performance, and the composite nonlinear feedback algorithm is designed to handle the declined driving performances and improve the transient performances. The designed GCNF controller is validated in the carsim simulations. The simulation results show that the GCNF controller can effectively assist the impaired drivers of different impaired levels to reduce the trajectory tracking errors and improve the driving performances.

DT Article
AB The coverage path planning (CPP) technique attracts growing interest in studies on underwater search and rescue (SAR) conducted with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with a side-scan sonar (SSS). In SAR missions, prior information is crucial. Aiming at the underwater SAR mission with prior information, a new coverage path planner (SAR-A*) is proposed. The ultimate goal is to generate a feasible path for completely covering the task area and preferentially visiting more valuable cells with fewer turns. First, the whole task area is decomposed into hexagon cells as waypoints to be visited for complete coverage. Second, the probability of discovering the target is obtained according to the target presence probability and the SSS detection ability. Under the assumption of prior target information, the target presence probability is modelled as a two-dimension Gaussian distribution based on predicted target locations or trajectories. Then, an optimal next-waypoint selection process is formulated as a multi-objective decision-making problem and solved by the weighted metric method. Finally, simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the generated path can improve the cumulative probability of discovering the target with fewer turns.

AB Recent advancements of the intelligent transportation system (ITS) provide an effective way of improving the overall efficiency of the energy management strategy (EMSs) for autonomous vehicles (AVs). The use of AVs possesses many advantages such as congestion control, accident prevention, and etc. However, energy management and traffic flow prediction (TFP) still remains a challenging problem in AVs. The complexity and uncertainties of driving situations adequately affect the outcome of the designed EMSs. In this view, this paper presents novel sustainable energy management with traffic flow prediction strategy (SEM-TPS) for AVs. The SEM-TPS technique applies type II fuzzy logic system (T2FLS) energy management scheme to accomplish the desired engine torque based on distinct parameters. In addition, the membership functions of the T2FLS scheme are chosen optimally using the barnacles mating optimizer (BMO). For accurate TFP, the bidirectional gated recurrent neural network (Bi-GRNN) model is used in AVs. A comprehensive experimental validation process is performed and the results are inspected with respect to several evaluation metrics. The experimental outcomes highlighted the supreme performance of the SEM-TPS technique over the recent state of art approaches.

AB Underwater explorations and probes have now become frequent for marine discovery and endangered resources protection. The decrease in natural light with an increase in water depth and the characteristic of the medium to absorb and scatter light pose crucial challenges to underwater vision systems. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) depend upon their imaging systems for navigation and environmental resource exploration. This paper proposes DeepRecog-an integrated underwater image deblurring and object recognition framework for AUV vision systems. The principle behind the image deblurring module involves a threefold approach consisting of CNNs, adaptive and transformative filters. The ensemble object detection and recognition module identifies marine life and other frequently existent underwater assets from AUV images and achieves mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.95 and was found to be 6.42% more precise than YOLOv3, 8.43% more than FasterRCNN + VGG16 and 15.78% more than FasterRCNN. This framework was created with the purpose of providing real-time detection and recognition with minimal delay. The system can also be employed for former images acquired from AUVs and hopes to facilitate efficient solutions for marine image post-processing.

AB This paper addressed the challenge of exploring large, unknown, and unstructured industrial environments with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The resulting system combined well-known components and techniques with a new manoeuvre to use a low-cost 2D laser to measure a 3D structure. Our approach combined frontier-based exploration, the Lazy Theta* path planner, and a flyby sampling manoeuvre to create a 3D map of large scenarios. One of the novelties of our system is that all the algorithms relied on the multi-resolution of the octomap for the world representation. We used a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HitL) simulation environment to collect accurate measurements of the capability of the open-source system to run online and on-board the UAV in real-time. Our approach is compared to different reference heuristics under this simulation environment showing better performance in regards to the amount of explored space. With the proposed approach, the UAV is able to explore 93% of the search space under 30 min, generating a path without repetition that adjusts to the occupied space covering indoor locations, irregular structures, and suspended obstacles.

AB The observation area of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) often contains undulating terrain in which the shallow portions make a great contribution to near-bottom magnetic data. Magnetic information from varying terrain may be inadvertently removed when traditional topographic correction methods are used to reduce the effect of undulating terrain on inversion results. In this study, we introduce a terrain-weighting matrix into the focused inversion process to overcome this problem. To counteract the natural decay of the potential field, we used the focused inversion with a minimum support function to obtain focused results and depth-weighting function. We also used the interpolation-iteration method to mitigate the influence of the fluctuating observation surface on the inversion results. We verified the effectiveness of the proposed method by conducting model tests using near-bottom data measured along the Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) by the AUV, Qianlong II. We obtained the 3D magnetization structure of the oceanic core complex (OCC) area at the 28th segment along the SWIR and concluded that the OCC was primarily composed of gabbroic rock.

AB Unmanned Aircraft Systems(UAS) have seen unprecedented levels of growth during the last two decades. Although many challenges still exist, one of the main UAS focus research areas is in navigation and control. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of helicopter navigation and control, focusing specifically on small-scale traditional main/tail rotor configuration helicopters. Unique to this paper, is the emphasis placed on navigation/control methods, modeling techniques, loop architectures and structures, and implementations. A 'reference template' is presented and used to provide a basis for comparative studies and determine the capabilities and limitations of algorithms for unmanned/autonomous flight, as well as for navigation, and control.

AB 3D model reconstruction plays a very important role in computer vision as well as in different engineering applications. The determination of the 3D model from multiple images is of key importance. One of the most important difficulties in autonomous 3D reconstruction is the (automatic) selection of the 'significant' points which carry information about the shape of the 3D bodies i.e. are characteristic from the model point Of view, Another problem to be solved is the point correspondence matching in different images.
   In this paper a 3D reconstruction technique is introduced, which is capable to determine the 3D model of a scene without any external (human) intervention. The method is based on recent results of image processing, epipolar geometry, and intelligent and soft techniques. Possible applications of the presented algorithm in vehicle system dynamics are also presented The results can be applied advantageously at other engineering fields, like car-crash analysis, robot guiding, object recognition, supervision of 3D scenes, etc,. as well.

AB A Cyberphysical system, being an autonomous guided vehicle (AGV) and having diverse applications such as thematic parks and product transfer in manufacturing units, is modeled and controlled. The models of all subsystems of the AGV are provided in discrete event systems (DES) form following the Ramadge-Wonham (R-W) framework. The safe performance of the AGV, being the desired behavior of the system, is presented in the form of desired rules and translated into a set of regular languages. Then, the regular languages are realized as supervisory automata in the framework of Supervisory Control Theory (SCT). To ease implementation and coordination of the control architecture, the supervisors are designed to be in two-state automata forms. The controllability of the regular languages, regarding the AGV, will be proved, using the physical realizability (PR) of the synchronous product of the automata of the system and the supervisors. Also, the nonblocking property of all the controlled automata will be proven to be satisfied. Simulation of the controlled AGV will validate the proposed method.

AB High-efficiency wireless power transfer (WPT) systems can present a perfect solution for fast-charging autonomous guided vehicles (AGV) to improve working hours in high-tech warehouses. Stationary charging stations reduce separation distance, improving coupling factor and power transfer efficiency. Analysis and design of the WPT system focused on maximum power at the load with a SS compensation circuit to reach high efficiency while applying the theory of power transformers design to maximize the power handleability with the physical dimensions. The proposed concept fits small AGVs. This paper proposes a unique ferrite structure for the transmitter ferromagnetic core. This novel shape introduces horizontal angular misalignment resistance due to the transmitter's omnidirectional concave disc ferrite core combined with an E-core ferrite at the receiver side. The proposed WPT system can output 200 W at 100 kHz. A realistic 3D model has been designed into a symmetrical equivalent to reducing complexity and computational effort. The visualization of the magnetic flux distribution demonstrated that the proposed design has a better path to flow without concentrating flux in small regions, reducing heating losses.

AB Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is a representative sensor for autonomous vehicles (AVs) by recognizing surrounding objects through detecting the reflected near-infrared (NIR) light However, this sensor has a weakness in recognizing the conventional carbon black-based dark-tone cars due to their low NIR reflectance. This cognitive impairment is a potential factor in a car accident in the AV system. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a dark-tone paint that can be applied to LiDAR by reflecting NIR In this work, we developed a NIR reflective dark-tone bilayer system. As the bottom layer (surfacer layer), we used a conventional NIR-reflective surfacer. For the dark-tone top layer (basecoat layer), organic pigment-based paints were prepared. Various combinations of organic pigments such as perylene, copper(II) phthalocyanine, perylene diimide derivatives were studied to give a dark tone. After optimization, the developed bilayers exhibited dark tone with low L* values (less than 25) and high reflectance in the NIR region, over 60%, especially at 905 nm. Therefore, we expect the developed bilayer system to be applied as a dark-tone paint detectable by LiDAR.

ID ARRAY ELEMENT LOCALIZATION; NAVIGATION
AB This paper develops a linearized Bayesian inversion algorithm for high-precision localization of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) on a test range using time difference of arrival acoustic data. The Bayesian approach allows the uncertainties of several factors, including precise receiver locations and bias and lateral variability of the water-column sound-speed profile, to he included in the inversion as unknown parameters with varying levels of prior information. This provides better estimates of these parameters (and hence AUV locations), and includes the effect of their uncertainties in the uncertainty estimates for AUV locations. A modeling study comparing AUV localization uncertainties from the linearized inversion that results from nonlinear Monte Carlo analysis shows that linearization errors are small, and hence linearized analysis is used to efficiently map AUV localization uncertainty as a function of position over the test range. These approaches are applied to model localization uncertainty for an AUV test range associated with the Victoria Experimental Network Under the Sea cabled observatory system, examining the factors mentioned above as well as the effects of water-column refraction and receiver geometry.

AB Tightly coupling GNSS pseudorange and Doppler measurements with other sensors is known to increase the accuracy and consistency of positioning information. Nowadays, high-accuracy geo-referenced lane marking maps are seen as key information sources in autonomous vehicle navigation. When an exteroceptive sensor such as a video camera or a lidar is used to detect them, lane markings provide positioning information which can be merged with GNSS data. In this paper, measurements from a forward-looking video camera are merged with raw GNSS pseudoranges and Dopplers on visible satellites. To create a localization system that provides pose estimates with high availability, dead reckoning sensors are also integrated. The data fusion problem is then formulated as sequential filtering. A reduced-order state space modeling of the observation problem is proposed to give a real-time system that is easy to implement. A Kalman filter with measured input and correlated noises is developed using a suitable error model of the GNSS pseudoranges. Our experimental results show that this tightly coupled approach performs better, in terms of accuracy and consistency, than a loosely coupled method using GNSS fixes as inputs.

AB A polar environment presents unique operational challenges for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). Each ice environment whether it be sea, fast or shelf poses risks with significant consequences for AUV missions. Deployments can be coordinated via vessels or on-ice camps. The science and operational specifications on missions preclude shepherding of the AUV and result in a reliance on longer range acoustic signal transfer for communications and localization due to the typically lateral nature of the mission.
   In November 2009, a 10 kHz acoustic beacon system was tested for ranging capability and suitability of use for an emergency AUV location and monitoring system in the Antarctic sea ice environment. The system was deployed from the RV Aurora Australis north of the Australian Camp Davis. This work includes discussion on test plan formulation, prediction using simulation and field performance results of the acoustic system. Actual noise data and acoustic signal detection measurements are presented and compared with the simulation. Conclusions were drawn on deployment Configuration and the testing setup.

AB The acoustic detection and classification of completely and partially buried objects in the multipath environment of the coastal ocean presents a major challenge to the mine countermeasures (MCM) community. However, the rapidly emerging autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) technology provides the opportunity of exploring entirely new sonar concepts based on mono-, bi- or multi-static configurations. For example, the medium frequency regime (1-10 kHz) with its bottom penetration advantage may be explored using large synthetic apertures, where acoustic information is accumulated over a series of sonar pings. The performance of such approaches is highly dependent on accurate platform navigation and timing, which poses a significant challenge to AUV developers, particularly because the navigation procedures are themselves dependent on the complicated multipath acoustic environment. Data from the GOATS'98 experiment have been analyzed to investigate the feasibility of combining seabed scattering data from consecutive pings of a fixed parametric source to form a bistatic synthetic aperture for target localization and imaging with an AUV based receiving platform. The paper describes different levels of bistatic processing including both incoherent and coherent beamforming and very large aperture interferometric approaches, and the associated performance tradeoffs are discussed.

AB This letter presents LaneMatch, a localization method for use in autonomous vehicles (AVs). It utilizes lane matching to obtain an AV's lane occupancy and current pose estimation. Matching is performed on a compact low-resolution road map generated from satellite images. Our approach addresses the following challenges for AVs using this map: (1) misalignment between roads on the satellite images and their global coordinates, and (2) incomplete or incorrect lane detection outputs. First, LaneMatch estimates the offset between the AV's global pose in the global coordinate system and its local map pose on the map. Secondly, LaneMatch utilizes a spatio-temporal integration of a particle filter and a factor graph to resolve lane-matching ambiguities. It strategically constrains the dimensionality of variables to obtain real-time performance. We use highway experiments to evaluate the processing time, occupancy accuracy, lateral/longitudinal and position/heading errors. These experiments show that LaneMatch localizes our AV rather precisely on the road map in real-time and can be used for navigation and planning purposes even in GNSS-unfriendly areas.

DE Long-term autonomy; autonomous underwater vehicle navigation;
   uncertainties; energy constraints
AB There has been significant interest in recent years in the utility and implementation of autonomous underwater and surface vehicles (AUVs and ASVs) for persistent surveillance of the ocean. Example studies include the dynamics of physical phenomena, e.g., ocean fronts, temperature and salinity profiles, and the onset of harmful algae blooms. For these studies, AUVs are presented with a complex planning and navigation problem to achieve autonomy lasting days and weeks under uncertainties while dealing with resource constraints. We address these issues by adopting motion, sensing, and environment uncertainties via a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework. We propose a methodology with a novel extension of POMDPs to incorporate spatiotemporally-varying ocean currents as energy and dynamic obstacles as environment uncertainty. Existing POMDP solutions such as the Cost-Constrained Partially Observable Monte-Carlo Planner (POMCP) do not account for energy efficiency. Therefore, we present a scalable Energy Cost-Constrained POMCP algorithm utilizing the predicted ocean dynamics that optimizes energy and environment costs along with goal-driven rewards. A theoretical analysis, along with simulation and real-world experiment results is presented to validate the proposed methodology.

TI Safe Trajectory Generation for Complex Urban Environments Using
   Spatio-Temporal Semantic Corridor
SO IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Autonomous vehicle navigation; motion and path planning
ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Planning safe trajectories for autonomous vehicles in complex urban environments is challenging since there are numerous semantic elements (such as dynamic agents, traffic lights, and speed limits) to consider. These semantic elements may have different mathematical descriptions, such as obstacle, constraint, and cost. It is non-trivial to tune the effects from different combinations of semantic elements for a stable and generalizable behavior. In this letter, we propose a novel unified spatio-temporal semantic corridor (SSC) structure, which provides a level of abstraction for different types of semantic elements. The SSC consists of a series of mutually connected collision-free cubes with dynamical constraints posed by the semantic elements in the spatio-temporal domain. The trajectory generation problem then boils down to a general quadratic programming formulation. Thanks to the unified SSC representation, our framework can generalize to any combination of semantic elements. Moreover, our formulation provides a theoretical guarantee that the entire trajectory is safe and constraint-satisfied, by using the convex hull and hodograph properties of piecewise Bezier curve parameterization. We also release the code of our method to accommodate benchmarking.

TI An Obstacle Recognizing Mechanism for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles

DT Article
AB The autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and the problems associated with its safe navigation have been studied for the last two decades. The real-time underwater obstacle recognition procedure still has many complications associated with it and the issue becomes worse with vague sensor data. These problems can be coped with the merger of a robust classification mechanism and a domain knowledge acquisition technique. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid mechanism to recognize underwater obstacles for AUV based on fuzzy domain ontology and support vector machine (SVM). SVM is an efficient algorithm that was developed for recognizing 3D object in recent years and is a new generation learning system based on recent advances in statistical learning theory. The amalgamation of fuzzy domain ontology with SVM boosts the performance of the obstacle recognition module by providing the timely semantic domain information of the surrounding circumstances. Also the reasoning ability of the fuzzy domain ontology can expedite the obstacle avoidance process. In order to evaluate the performance of the system, we developed a prototype simulator based on OpenGL and VC++. We compared the outcomes of our proposed technique with backpropagation algorithm and classic SVM based techniques.

AB Fusion of information gathered from multiple sources is essential to build a comprehensive situation picture for autonomous ground vehicles. In this paper, an approach which performs scene parsing and data fusion for a 3D-LIDAR scanner (Velodyne HDL-64E) and a video camera is described. First of all, a geometry segmentation algorithm is proposed for detection of obstacles and ground areas from data collected by the Velodyne scanner. Then, corresponding image collected by the video camera is classified patch by patch into more detailed categories. After that, parsing result of each frame is obtained by fusing result of Velodyne data and that of image using the fuzzy logic inference framework. Finally, parsing results of consecutive frames are smoothed by the Markov random field based temporal fusion method. The proposed approach has been evaluated with datasets collected by our autonomous ground vehicle testbed in both rural and urban areas. The fused results are more reliable than that acquired via analysis of only images or Velodyne data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Vehicle control systems such as ESC (electronic stability control), MDPS (motor-driven power steering), and ECS (electronically controlled suspension) improve vehicle stability, driver comfort, and safety. Vehicle control systems such as ACC (adaptive cruise control), LKA (lane-keeping assistance), and AEB (autonomous emergency braking) have also been actively studied in recent years as functions that assist drivers to a higher level. These DASs (driver assistance systems) are implemented using vehicle sensors that observe vehicle status and send signals to the ECU (electronic control unit). Therefore, the failure of each system sensor affects the function of the system, which not only causes discomfort to the driver but also increases the risk of accidents. In this paper, we propose a new method to detect and isolate faults in a vehicle control system. The proposed method calculates the constraints and residuals of 12 systems by applying the model-based fault diagnosis method to the sensor of the chassis system. To solve the inaccuracy in detecting and isolating sensor failure, we applied residual sensitivity to a threshold that determines whether faults occur. Moreover, we applied a sensitivity analysis to the parameters semi-correlation table to derive a fault isolation table. To validate the FDI (fault detection and isolation) algorithm developed in this study, fault signals were injected and verified in the HILS (hardware-in-the-loop simulation) environment using an RCP (rapid control prototyping) device.

AB In this paper, path following control of an unmanned ground vehicle is presented based on the feedback of position and orientation errors. The measurement unit of this autonomous vehicle prototyped for such tasks contains a real-time kinematic global positioning system (RTK-GPS), an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and an absolute encoder to accurately define the position and orientation of the car. A model predictive control was proposed for the path following of the mobile robot based on the successive linearized and discretized kinematic model. This optimal control method performs on the lowest position and orientation errors with respect to a non-holonomic virtual vehicle that is considered to move flawlessly on a given reference path and the smoother steering angle. The paths followed here are defined by rationally based splines or known geometric curves created with control points from a digital mapping program. This paper includes both simulation and real-time experimental studies. The outcomes were examined in terms of the design performance and control strategy of the vehicle. Despite the physical constraints on the vehicle prototype, it has been observed that position and orientation errors occur within satisfactory limits. In particular, the fact that the steering angle is not subjected to excessive oscillations indicates that the control method has a good performance.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE; STEERING CONTROL
AB In recent years, the model predictive control (MPC) algorithm has been increasingly applied to the path tracking of self-driving vehicles due to its capacity to deal with dynamic constraints explicitly. The control performance of MPC is highly dependent on the accuracy dynamic model; however, as vehicles are strongly coupled nonlinear systems, the prediction accuracy of the classical mechanism model decreases significantly at high-speed conditions, leading to increased control errors. This paper proposes replacing the classical mechanism model with a recurrent neural network (RNN) for vehicle dynamical state prediction under the framework of MPC to achieve higher control effects under high speed steering processes. The RNN vehicle dynamic model uses historical data of control and state variables to predict future states. Based on this novel model, longitudinal/lateral coupled model predictive control is realized. The differential evolution algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem in the controller. Finally, the prediction accuracy of the RNN model is verified on the real vehicle dataset and compared with linear/nonlinear mechanism models. The control algorithm proposed in this paper is compared with classical MPC against low and high speeds (10m/s and 30m/s) on the ADAMS/Python/Simulink joint simulation platform. The results show that the control accuracy and stability of the longitudinal/lateral coupled neural network MPC are higher than classical MPC, especially at high speed.

ID ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; RECOGNITION
AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) rely on their perception systems to detect traffic objects, with the uncertainty in detection results significantly influencing the safety of their decision-making and control mechanisms. This paper introduces a safety potential field for CAVs that accounts for target detection errors. Initially, the paper categorizes errors arising from target detection into classification, labelling, and positioning categories. Subsequently, an elliptical model-based safety potential field is developed, incorporating potential field line optimization using safety thresholds and lane lines. This approach facilitates the determination of critical values and safety distribution for the potential field. The paper then proceeds with coefficient calibration and experimental analysis to validate the reliability of the proposed model. Findings indicate that as target detection errors increasingly manifest, the safety potential field area for CAVs becomes more restrictive, enhancing the field's sensitivity to these errors. The critical safety value for CAVs is maintained within the range of [0 m, 7 m], providing a stable basis for decision-making and control. Additionally, the safety value for CAVs falls between [15, 25], favouring the improvement of safety gradient distribution under the calibrated safety potential field values.
   This paper proposes a potential safety field for connected and automated vehicle considering target detection errors. Firstly, the target detection error is classified into classification, labelling, and localization. Secondly, the coefficient calibration and experimental analysis are carried out to verify the feasibility of the proposed method.image

AB Many industrial-Internet-of-Things applications require autonomous operation and incorporate devices in inaccessible locations. Recent advances in wireless power transfer (WPT) and autonomous vehicle technologies, in combination, have the potential to solve a number of residual problems concerning the maintenance of, and data collection from embedded devices. Equipping inexpensive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and embedded devices with subsystems to facilitate WPT allows a UAV to become a viable mobile power delivery vehicle (PDV) and data collection agent. A key challenge is, therefore, to ensure that a PDV can optimally schedule power delivery across the network, such that it is as reliable and resource efficient as possible. To achieve this and out-perform naive on-demand recharging strategies, in this article, we propose a two-stage wireless power network (WPN) approach in which a large network of devices may be grouped into small clusters, where packets of energy inductively delivered to each cluster by the PDV are acoustically distributed to devices within the cluster. In this article, we describe a novel dynamic recharge scheduling algorithm that combines genetic weighted clustering with nearest neighbor search to jointly minimize PDV travel distance and WPT losses. The efficacy and performance of the algorithm are evaluated in simulation using experimentally derived traces, and the algorithm is shown to achieve similar to 90% throughput for large, dense networks.

AB Aerial surveys are valuable tools for wildlife research and management However, problems with safety, cost, statistical integrity and logistics continue to impede aerial surveys from manned aircraft. The use of small, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may offer promise for addressing these problems and become a useful tool for many wildlife applications, such as for collecting low-altitude aerial imagery. During 2002 and 2003, we used a 1.5-m wingspan UAV equipped with autonomous control and sophisticated video equipment to test the potential usefulness of such an aircraft for wildlife research applications in Florida, USA. The UAV we used completed > 30 missions (missions averaging 13 km linear distance covered) over 2 years before finally crashing due to engine failure. The UAV captured high-quality, progressive-scan video of a number of landscapes and wildlife species (white ibis [Eudocimus albus], other white wading birds, American alligator [Alligator mississippiensis], and Florida manatee [Trichechus manatus]). The UAV system was unable to collect georeferenced imagery and was difficult to deploy in unimproved areas. The performance of the autonomous control system and the quality of the progressive-scan imagery indicated strong promise for future UAVs as useful field tools. For small UAVs to be useful as management or research tools, they should be durable, modular, electric powered, launchable and recoverable in rugged terrain, autonomously controllable, operable with minimal training, and collect georeferenced imagery.

AB Trajectory planning is a core technology for autonomous vehicle directlyreflecting the driving safety and efficiency. In this paper, a spatial-speed decoupled planning method is studied for real-time trajectory generation in the on-road environment. The proposed approach mainly includes two parts: optimization-based lateral planning and selection-based longitudinal speed planning. The optimization-based lateral planning is employed to generate an optimal collision-free and smooth path by solving a quadratic programming problem. Specifically, the lateral planning first constructs a safe corridor by integrating obstacles and initial risky corridor together in the Frenet frame. The safe corridor is useful for quadratic programming problem formulation. The selecting-based longitudinal speed planning is proposed to generate a suitable and continuous velocity trajectory. The novel speed selector considering four cases is designed to select a more suitable reference velocity in different lane situations. The continuous velocity trajectory is obtained by solving piecewise continuous quartic polynomial. As a result, the combination of the spatial path and the velocity trajectory is the final planning result. The proposed algorithm is tested extensively in a simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has good real-time property and practical validity.

ID SYNCHRONIZATION
AB Most applications of underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) rely upon reliable location information of sensor nodes. However, the harsh underwater environment makes localization more challenging as compared to terrestrial sensor networks. This paper is concerned with a localization issue for UASNs, subject to clock asynchronization and node mobility. A hybrid architecture including autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), active and passive sensor nodes is designed, where AUVs act as anchor nodes to provide localization information for sensor nodes. In order to eliminate the effect of asynchronous clocks and compensate the mobility of sensor nodes, an asynchronous localization algorithm with mobility prediction is provided for active and passive sensor nodes. Then, two localization optimization problems are formulated as minimizing the sum of all measurement errors. To solve the localization optimization problems, iterative least squares estimators are designed. In addition, the convergence analysis and Cramer-Rao lower bound for the localization errors are also provided. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed localization approach can reduce the localization time by comparing with the exhaustive search-based localization method. Meanwhile, the asynchronous algorithm in this paper can effectively eliminate the impact of the clock asynchronization and node mobility.

AB The fault feature extraction and diagnosis of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in complex environments pose significant challenges due to the intricate nature of the signals that reflect the AUVs' states in the deep ocean. In this paper, an analytical model-free fault diagnosis algorithm based on a multi-channel full convolutional neural network (MC-FCNN) is introduced to establish patterns between AUV states and potential fault types using multi-sensor signals. Firstly, the AUV raw dataset undergoes random forest multiple imputation by chained equations (RF-MICE) to serve as the input of the convolution neural network. Next, signal features are extracted through the full convolution channel, which can be fused as multilayer perceptron (MLP) input and Softmax classifier for fault identification. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed MC-FCNN model, fault diagnosis experiments are conducted using the dataset sourced from the Zhejiang University Laboratory with missing data. The experimental results demonstrate that, even with 60% of the data missing, the proposed RF-MICE with MC-FCNN model can still achieve an ideal fault identification.

AB The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) as flying radio access network (RAN) nodes offers a promising complement to traditional fixed terrestrial deployments. More recently, yet still in the context of wireless networks, drones have also been envisioned for use as radio frequency (RF) sensing and localization devices. In both cases, the advantage of using UAVs lies in their ability to navigate themselves freely in 3D and in a timely manner to locations of space where the obtained network throughput or sensing performance is optimal. In practice, the selection of a proper location or trajectory for the UAV very much depends on local terrain features, including the position of surrounding radio obstacles. Hence, the robot must be able to map the features of its radio environment as it performs its data communication or sensing services. The challenges related to this task, referred here as radio mapping, are discussed in this article. Its promises related to efficient trajectory design for autonomous radio-aware UAVs are highlighted, along with algorithm solutions. The advantages induced by radio-mapping in terms of connectivity, sensing, and localization performance are illustrated.

AB Multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) can complete complex ocean exploration missions cooperatively. This paper proposes a containment control algorithm under time-varying constraints by using a neural network for control of multiple benthic AUVs which are called the Ocean Bottom Flying Node (OBFN) systems. The multiple OBFNs in the presence of nonlinear model uncertainties are under the directed topology. First, we define the auxiliary variable and low-order filter. The anti-windup saturation auxiliary system is constructed in presence of the input saturation. Further, the adaptive law and neural network are designed to compensate environmental disturbances and systems model uncertainties, respectively. Moreover, in order to ensure the control performance of OBFN, an exponential boundary constraint is imposed which could constrain the system error convergent rates and bounds. Lyapunov stability theorem and graph theory are used to prove that the multiple OBFN systems are uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, simulation results for multiple OBFNs illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A new encoder and decoder for real time state estimation of nonlinear dynamic systems at the end of communication link when the measurements are sent through the limited capacity erasure channel, are presented. Then, using the available results from control theory, a controller for reference tracking and hence the stability of the system is also designed.

AB Unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) that swarm with both autonomous decision-making and cooperative attacking have been regarded as revolutionary elements of modern warfare. In such a swarm, inter-group connectivity must be ensured in a network to maintain a collective consensus. In recent years, academia and industry have made many efforts to achieve common tactical data link systems and commercial drone networks. However, the existing results have difficulty meeting the needs of cooperative autonomous UCAV swarms with both hypersonic mobility and time sensitivity in severe confrontation scenarios. In this article, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the network used for the hypersonic UCAV swarms, which can be considered as a special form of mobile wireless network. Furthermore, faced with specific functional demands, we summarize the main challenges of designing this dedicated network. In addition, a comprehensive survey of potential solutions for the network design is presented. Lastly, we discuss the possible capabilities of the network given the current forefront of technology, as well as remaining challenges and open issues.

AB This paper presents a new solution approach for managing the motion of a fleet of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in indoor factory environments. AVs are requested to serve a number of workstations (WS) (following a specified desired production plan for materials requirements) while taking into account the safe movement (collisions avoidance) in the shop floor as well as time duration and energy resources. The proposed approach is based on the Bump-Surface concept to represent the 2D environment through a single mathematical entity. The solution of the combined problem of path planning and task scheduling is searched on a higher-dimension B-surface (in our case 3D) in such a way that its inverse image into the robot environment satisfies the given objectives and constraints. Then, a modified Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to search for a near-optimum solution. The objective of the fleet coordination consists of determining the best feasible paths for the AVs so that all the WS are served at the lowest possible cost. The efficiency of the developed method is investigated and discussed through characteristic simulated experiments concerning a variety of operating environments.

AB The thruster system is one of the most critical parts of an autonomous underwater vehicle. Feedback, propeller, motor and driver faults are four common field faults of thruster systems. This paper investigates an unsupervised framework based on torques and multi-head convo-lutional autoencoders for the mentioned faults. The proposed method utilizes an extended state observer to estimate the motor load. The propeller torque is estimated using a physics-guided neural network. Meanwhile, the relationship between the patterns change among torques (motor load and propeller torque) and different faults are analyzed. Then, to avoid feature aliasing, two independent encoders of the multi-head convolutional autoencoder extract the pattern features between the torques automatically. Finally, faults are detected and classified based on the various patterns of the extracted torque features. The sea trial data verified the effectiveness of the scheme. The results show that the method can accurately detect and classify five specific faults: current feedback fault, speed feedback fault, propeller loss, propeller winding and open-circuit fault.

AB In complex environments with long-term changes such as light, seasonal, and viewpoint changes, robust, accurate, and high-frequency global positioning based on light detection and ranging (LiDAR) map is still a challenge, which is crucial for autonomous vehicles or robots. To this end, a novel observation model that relies on the siamese multitask convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with multimodule cascaded is creatively presented in this article. In particular, a new pseudoimage representing LiDAR submap is designed to enrich scene texture and enhance rotation invariance. Besides, novel siamese CNNs that are coupled by NeXtVLAD and long short-term memory is designed for the first time, which can reliably predict similarity and quaternion at the same time. Finally, the predicted quaternion observation is integrated into the extended Kalman filter framework for multisensor fusion to achieve robust high-frequency global pose estimation. Extensive evaluations on KITTI, NCLT, and real-world datasets suggest that the proposed method not only obtains the remarkable precision-recall performance, but also effectively enhances and improves the robustness and accuracy of long-term positioning.

AB A three-dimensional mobile docking control method consisting of a docking position estimation method, a control strategy with a switched guidance algorithm, and an observer-based backstepping sliding mode controller is proposed to control an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to complete a mobile docking mission. First, a five-degrees-of-freedom kinematics and dynamics model of an underactuated AUV is constructed. Using this model, reduced-order linear extended state observers are obtained and further used to estimate and compensate for the unknown disturbance. In addition, a docking position estimation method is developed to estimate the docking position roughly when a mobile docking station performs a uniform circular motion. Furthermore, a control strategy with a switched guidance algorithm is designed to avoid unreasonable behaviors of AUVs and reach the desired position. Finally, an observer-based backstepping sliding mode controller is designed to make an AUV complete mobile docking mission efficiently and reliably in the presence of unknown current disturbances. The proposed control system has been proven to be stable by employing the Lyapunov stability theory.

AB To facilitate autonomous and excellent transmission lines inspection, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must be equipped with path-planning intelligence. This paper presents a novel and efficient 3D path-planning algorithm for autonomous transmission lines inspection. In this work, UAVs-based inspection includes two modes: line corridor sketchy inspection and transmission tower detail inspection. A fixed-wing UAV is employed to conduct line corridor inspection, while rotorcraft UAV is used to carry on tower inspection. The path-planning algorithm also includes two modes accordingly. Consider coverage information, observation quality of inspection targets, vehicle motion constraints, inspection rules, and obstacles, both modes try to find a set of best viewpoints, then connect the best viewpoints as well as plan a collision-free and feasible path. The best viewpoints are beneficial to judge the status of accessories and lines. To evaluate the capabilities of the proposed algorithm, a few challenging test-cases were employed which include simulation case, test-bed case, and real-data case. Experimental results verified the high performance of the proposed algorithm. Finally, the real-hardware implementation is also discussed.

AB The coordinated control of multiple AUVs systems is the key to guarantee the consensus of AUVs motion status. This paper proposes coordinated control protocols with or without time delay for the coordination control problem of multiple AUVs under switching communication topologies based on discrete information. Firstly, the state feedback linearization method is used to convert coupled nonlinear AUV kinematics and kinetic equations into second-order affine forms, and a mathematical model is given in discrete time. Because the leader AUV is equipped with more accurate sensors, the leader-follower type of formation structure is adopted, leader AUV sends status information to followers, and the follower AUVs communicate with themselves randomly. Secondly, the coordination control protocols are designed for the cases of no time delay and time delay, and sufficient conditions for the consensus algorithm are analyzed and given based on the matrix theory. Finally, the correctness of the proposed coordinated control protocols is proved by simulation experiments and the trajectories of multiple AUVs converge to the desired trajectory.

TI Obstacle detection for lake-deployed autonomous surface vehicles using
   RGB imagery
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB We describe and test an obstacle-detection system for small, lake-deployed autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) that relies on a low-cost, consumer-grade camera and runs on a single-board computer. A key feature of lakes that must be accounted for is the frequent presence of the shoreline in images as well as the land-sky boundary. These particularities, along with variable weather conditions, result in a wide range of scene variations, including the possible presence of glint. The implemented algorithm is based on two main steps. First, possible obstacles are detected using an innovative gradient-based image processing algorithm developed especially for a camera with a low viewing angle to the water (i.e., the situation for a small ASV). Then, true and false positives are differentiated using correlationbased multi-frame analysis. The algorithm was tested extensively on a small ASV deployed in Lake Geneva. Under operational conditions, the algorithm processed 640x480-pixel images from a Raspberry Pi Camera at about 3-4 Hz on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B computer. The present algorithm demonstrates that single-board computers can be used for effective and low-cost obstacle detection systems for ASVs operating in variable lake conditions.

ID DESIGN
AB Due to their specific properties composite materials are being used in a variety of structures. Modern underwater vehicles are a good example: they are light, sturdy and corrosion resistant. Demands posed on such a structures are good sailing properties, good maneuverability and the ability to withstand designed pressure. Nonlinear finite element method (NFEM) is a sophisticated engineering tool that may be used to estimate limitations in the composite-made submersible design. However, the application of the method is not always straightforward. Commercially available NFEM software provides a number of material models but their application is limited by the available material properties. In addition, numerical problems may occur and both material model and numerical model must be verified against instabilities. A particular submersible is being modeled and subjected to NFEM analysis. The overview of commercial software material models is given and their application in structural analysis of a submersible is evaluated. Comparison is made between different structural materials in order to check the submersible maximum diving depth. Numerical problems are commented, different material solutions compared and structure enhancements proposed.

ID SEA; NAVIGATION; DISCOVERY; MOTION; CHIOS
AB The goals of this article are twofold. First, we detail the operations and discuss the results of the 2005 Chios ancient shipwreck survey. This survey was conducted by an international team of engineers, archaeologists, and natural scientists off the Greek island of Chios in the northeastern Aegean Sea using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) built specifically for high-resolution site inspection and characterization. Second, using the survey operations as context, we identify the specific challenges of adapting AUV technology for deep water archaeology and describe how our team addressed these challenges during the Chios expedition. After identifying the state of the art in robotic tools for deep water archaeology, we discuss opportunities in which new developments and research (e.g., AUV platforms, underwater imaging, remote sensing, and navigation techniques) will improve the rapid assessment of deep water archaeological sites. It is our hope that by reporting on the Chios field expedition we can both describe the opportunities that AUVs bring to fine-resolution seafloor site surveys and elucidate future opportunities for collaborations between roboticists and ocean scientists.

AB This paper describes the best choice to fuzzy implication operator and alpha-cut that are proper to the heuristic search technique for real-time collision avoidance of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). A fuzzy implication operator is applied to the computation of fuzzy triangle product that constructs a new fuzzy relation between two fuzzy relations. An alpha-cut transforms a fuzzy relation into a crisp relation which is represented as a matrix. Those are the theoretical basis of heuristic search technique. In this paper, we review briefly our previous work-a heuristic search technique using fuzzy relational products for the collision avoidance system of AUVs, and propose the selection of a fuzzy implication operator and alpha-cut which are the most suitable for the search technique. In order to verify the optimality and the efficiency of the selected fuzzy implication operator and alpha- cut, we simulate every case of alpha-cut for each fuzzy implication operator in view of the cost of path and the number of alpha -cut generating acceptable path to the goal.

AB Control system design of aerospace vehicles with actuator saturation is an important practical design problem that many previous approaches to nonlinear autopilot design did not consider. In particular, small unmanned aerial vehicle rotorcraft actuators often have physical limitations such as a restricted onboard power supply. Disregard of actuator saturation can affect the final performance, but the reduction in performance can be mitigated if actuator saturation is included in the controller design. In this paper, we propose a nested-saturation-based nonlinear controller for the stabilization of a rotary-wing aircraft. This control strategy allows the incorporation of actuator magnitude saturation and has satisfactory dynamic performance. The nested-saturation technique enables the controller to ensure the global asymptotic stability of a quadrotor helicopter while improving the performance of the closed-loop system. By using Lyapunov analysis, the convergence property is established for the complete nonlinear model of the quadrotor rotorcraft. Simulation results show the performance of the proposed control strategy. Using embedded sensors and onboard control, we performed a real-time autonomous flight. Indeed, experimental results have shown that the proposed control strategy is able to autonomously perform the tasks of taking off, hovering, and landing.

AB Time-delay control (TDC) is widely recognized as a robust and straightforward model-free control approach for complex systems. However, the transient performance and settling time are often given less consideration in most TDC-based controllers. In this article, we propose an integrated control protocol that combines fixed-time prescribed performance control with time-delay estimation techniques for autonomous ground vehicles. The proposed control paradigm offers the advantages of being model-free while ensuring that the preview error converges to a neighborhood of zero within a fixed time, adhering to predefined constraint functions. To overcome the limitations of commonly used exponential decay boundaries, a prescribed performance function that remains independent of the initial conditions is employed. Furthermore, a high-order model-free fixed-time differentiator is constructed to observe the high-order dynamics of the preview error, which are essential for estimating unknown model dynamics. Finally, the simulations and practical experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed control protocol.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is a complex nonlinear system and its control is accompanied by various challenges. This paper focuses on the three dimensional (3D) trajectory tracking control of a fully -actuated AUV in the presence of model uncertainties, unmeasured velocity, time-varying external disturbance and input saturation. First, taking the model uncertainties and external disturbances as the total disturbances, an extended state observer (ESO) is designed to estimate the unmeasured velocity and total disturbances. Then, the saturated controller based on contraction theory and its application in singular perturbation system (SPS) is obtained so that the AUV tracks the desired trajectory and avoids exceeding the limit of the actuator. The estimation error, tracking error and the error between the ideal controller and the actual controller are analyzed by contraction theory, and the explicit bounds of these errors are given. At last, comparative numerical simulations are provided to show the effectiveness of the ESO and the advantages of the saturated controller.

TI Virtual Risk Assessment for the Deployment of Autonomous Shuttles
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB In recent years, trials of autonomous shuttle vehicles have been conducted worldwide. Currently, there exists no generalized process model for deployment and continuous operation of shuttles. Shuttle suppliers use their own developed procedures, making it difficult for the relevant stakeholders (e.g., public authorities) to assess the risk of potential shuttle deployment. The Digibus(R) Austria flagship project, among other goals, develops an approach for the virtual risk assessment of identified critical spots along proposed shuttle paths. Embedded into the deployment process, this serves as a significant body of evidence for safety assurance in shuttle deployment. Conducted simulation studies optimizing the shuttle's trajectory for concrete maneuvers, along with derived requirements for the associated virtual environment, are part of the first noteworthy outcomes. Concretely, the developed virtual environment is integrated in the framework used for virtual validation. The framework is then used for a detailed evaluation of a right-turn maneuver, analyzing possible shuttle trajectories. Considerable differences in sensor coverage at the shuttle's stopping point can be shown. Conclusively, by utilizing the shuttle's restricted operational domain, the proposed virtual risk assessment is considered the first step toward a general procedure for the safety assurance of automated vehicles.

AB In this paper, a generic multi-sensor fusion framework is developed for the localization of intelligent vehicles and mobile robots. The localization framework is based on moving horizon estimation (MHE). Unlike the commonly used probabilistic filtering algorithms - for example, extended Kalman filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) - MHE relies on solving successive least squares optimization problems over the innovation of multiple sensors' measurements and a specific estimation horizon. In this paper, we present an efficient and generic multi-sensor fusion scheme, based on MHE. The proposed multi-sensor fusion scheme is capable of operating with different sensors' rates, missing measurements, and outliers. Moreover, the proposed scheme is based on a multi-threading architecture to reduce its computational cost, making it more feasible for practical applications. The MHE fusion method is tested using simulated data as well as real experimental data sequences from an intelligent vehicle and a mobile robot combining measurements from different sensors to get accurate localization results. The performance of MHE is compared against that of UKF, where the MHE estimation results show superior performance.

TI Dynamic Trajectory Planning for Automated Lane Changing Using the

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; MODELING DURATION; DECISION-MAKING
AB As one of the key algorithms in supporting AV (autonomous vehicle) to complete the LC (lane changing) maneuver, the LTP (LC trajectory planning) algorithm generates safe and efficient LC trajectory for the AV. This paper proposes a novel dynamic LTP algorithm based on the quintic polynomial curve. This algorithm is capable of adjusting LC trajectory according to the state changes of the surrounding driving environment. The formulation of our proposed algorithm mainly consists the underlying form of trajectory equation, the optimization objective function, the corresponding constrains, and the SQP (sequential quadratic programming) algorithm. For each planning step, the time-based quintic polynomial function is introduced to model the trajectory equation. The problem of solving the parameters of the corresponding equation is then transformed into an optimization problem, which takes driver's safety, comfort, and efficiency into account. After that, the SQP algorithm is employed to solve this optimization problem. Finally, both numerical simulation and field-data validation are used to verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. We anticipate that the research could provide certain valuable insights for developing more reliable LC algorithms for AVs.

AB Recently, there has been a significant amount of research related to heavy trucks operating as connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). As argued in this paper, to understand the potential impact on the freeway system of CAV technologies, analyses should be conducted using the standard US methodological framework. Consequently, this paper uses the exact Highway Capacity Manual, Sixth Edition (HCM-6) equal capacity passenger car equivalent (EC-PCE) methodology to estimate capacity and EC-PCEs for CAV truck platoons on freeway segments. It was found that EC-PCE values for CAV trucks are, on average, 34.3% lower compared to the values for non-CAV trucks, indicating that CAV platoons can have a positive effect on highway capacity. The amount of decrease is a function of a number of CAV operational assumptions, and these are studied through a sensitivity analysis. This paper demonstrates that the effect of CAV truck platoons can be modeled using the standard HCM-6 approach, and the methodology allows meaningful comparisons so that traffic agencies can better prepare for the adoption of CAV technologies.

AB This paper presents a multi-objective design method of underwater wireless power transfer (UWPT) system for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) based on the cooperative design of compensation network and a DC/DC converter, considering seawater eddy current loss. Firstly, the electromagnetic field model of the underwater coil is established based on the non-axisymmetric model, and the analysis method of eddy current loss is given. Then, according to the circuit model with seawater eddy current loss, a two-port network including a compensation network and coil coupling model, is established. The cooperative design method of compensation network and DC/DC converter is presented to improve the efficiency of the UWPT system and reduce the electrical stress of the inverter, considering seawater eddy current loss. Finally, a 1 kW AUV UWPT system prototype is built. The experimental results prove that the proposed seawater eddy current loss analysis method is effective. The experimental results also show that the proposed compensation network and DC / DC converter duty cycle design method can achieve the purpose of constant voltage output, optimization of system efficiency, reduction of inverter electrical stress and inverter zero-voltage-switch.

AB Design of underwater acoustic (UWA) modems for compact-sized, underwater platforms such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is challenging because of the practical requirement to keep an engineering balance between the performance and the system overhead. Considering this type of mobile communication scenario, Doppler spread as well as the multipath draws substantial attention in implementing the system's design and engineering. Specifically, for a small AUV, the large computational complexity of real-time resampling for the classic Doppler correction poses significant difficulty for the limited capability of the low-cost processor. In this paper, by adopting an adjustable AD (analog-to-digital) sampling rate, a Doppler compensation approach is proposed to enable low-complexity hardware implementation. Based on this, a direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) acoustic modem is designed for a low-cost, small-sized AUV. Meanwhile, the performance evaluation of this acoustic modem is conducted in terms of the robustness upon varying Doppler as well as AUV integration. Finally, experimental results performed on a commercial, small-sized AUV under different speeds are reported to verify the effectiveness of the proposed acoustic modem.

AB An effective path planner is critical for autonomous traversal of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in harsh environments. This paper describes a novel path planning method considering Bezier curves and a two-layer planning framework. In the two-layer framework, a road centerline (RCL) estimator located on the upper layer works as a global planner to obtain the local target for the bottom local planner. The RCL is estimated from a series of candidate Bezier curves based on a safety criterion. In the bottom layer, an optimal trajectory planner and a speed planner make up the local planner to obtain the desired steering turning angle and linear speed. The criteria for optimal trajectory selection are designed for comfortable driving. Road safety is considered in the speed planner for robust driving. Three sets of simulations are used to evaluate and quantify the relative performance of variations of our path planning algorithm. The proposed path planning method is implemented on a modified Polaris RZR 800 UGV, too. Two experiments based on this UGV are set up in the country road environment to demonstrate the viability of the proposed method.

AB Time delay is a major problem in the acoustic communication technology. Considering such a background, a new dynamic model is proposed for an improved error estimation algorithm in this paper. And error propagation equations are constructed for an inertial navigation system/Doppler velocity log integrated navigation system. The time delay problem is reconsidered for acoustic communication with an ultra-short baseline acoustic positioning system that uses a multi-autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) cooperative navigation process in master-slave mode. The characteristics of time delays in acoustic communication are considered and the time delay is converted into a measurement bias within an observation equation for the slave AUV platform. Under the framework of a standard Kalman filter, an improved error estimation algorithm is presented to address the problem that occurs when random measurement bias exists in the dynamic linear system model. Based on the Monte Carlo method, the simulation results illustrate that compared with traditional methods, the error estimation algorithm proposed in this paper can effectively decrease positioning errors caused by time delays in acoustic communication.

AB This paper presents a novel moving base alignment for the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) fiber optic gyro (FOG) inertial navigation system (INS). Unlike several current techniques, the high requirement with navigation computer cause by the large dimension of the state variables is resolved by introducing two-stage Kalman filter (TKF) in the method of moving base alignment. In addition, the accuracy of moving base alignment for FOG INS is influenced by the observation accuracy of Doppler velocity log (DVL), which caused by measurement technology, ocean current and measurement environment. In order to inhibiting the measurement noise of DVL, adaptive two-stage Kalman filter (ATKF) is introduced in the moving base alignment. The parameter of unknown measurement noise is obtained by comparing the prediction error of the observation by two different ways. The effectiveness of this approach was demonstrates by simulation and experimental study.

AB Point stabilization control of a class of asymmetric underactuated high-speed unmanned marine vehicle is discussed, and a robust exponential stabilization control algorithm is proposed based on homogeneous theory, average system theory, and nonlinear backstepping technology. Firstly, point stabilization control problem of a high-speed underactuated unmanned marine vehicle with model asymmetry is formulated, and then global differential homeomorphism transformation is designed, in order to overcome the difficulties caused by unmanned marine vehicle with model asymmetry. Secondly, the control system is transformed into the standard form of homogeneous interference system by output state variable transformation design and input transformation design. A novel interference function is designed, and then difficulties caused by the higher order velocities in damping coefficients are solved, via homogeneous stability design and homogeneity degree analyzing the expansion of the designed new state variables. Thirdly, by introducing the virtual input of backstepping and the average system theory, point stabilization controller for the underactuated high-speed unmanned marine vehicle is proposed based on homogeneous theory, which could achieve global and periodic time-varying robust exponential stability, and then stability of the point stabilization control algorithm is proved by using homogeneous stability theory and average system stability theory. At last, the effectiveness and accuracy of the control algorithm proposed is verified by semi-physical simulation experiment carried out in our laboratory.

AB The rapid development and adaptation of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving increases the burden of in-vehicle networks. In-vehicle networks are now required to provide a fast data rate and bounded delay for real-time operation, while conventional protocols such as controller area networks, local interconnected networks, and FlexRay begin to show limitations. Ethernet-based time-sensitive network (TSN) technology has been proposed as an alternative. TSN is a set of Ethernet standards being developed by the IEEE TSN task group, which aims to satisfy requirements such as real-time operation, stability, and low and bounded latency, and it can be used in automotive, industrial, and aerospace applications. This study introduces several standards for Ethernet traffic scheduling based on TSN technology and proposes a heuristic-based scheduling algorithm for Ethernet scheduling. In addition, three network configurations are simulated using OMNeT++ to show the applicability. The heuristic TSN scheduling algorithm is a straightforward and systematic procedure for practical network designers.

AB This paper presents the design and development of an automated steering control system that has been successfully deployed on an 18.3-m (60-ft) articulated bus for revenue service in a bus rapid transit line in Eugene, OR, USA, between June 2013 and May 2015. This automated steering system provides both lane keeping and S-curve precision docking on 4-km-long narrow and curving urban segments with six stations and mixed traffic lanes while the operator controls the speed. The objective of deploying an automated bus that carries passengers for an extensive period of time elevated the system safety and performance requirements. This paper describes three key elements in the controller design that address the safety and performance challenges, i.e., high precision, fault tolerance, and control transitions. The experience of designing and deploying such a system in revenue service helps advance the field of automated vehicle by directly addressing its safety issues as an integral part of the automated vehicle control system design.

SO JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE-ENGINEERING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS

DT Article
ID ORDER
AB Over the last decade, considerable interest has been shown from industry, government and academia to the design of Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) autonomous aerial vehicles. This paper uses the recently developed sliding mode control driven by sliding mode disturbance observer (SMC-SMDO) approach to design a robust flight controller for a small quadrotor vehicle. This technique allows for a continuous control robust to external disturbance and model uncertainties to be computed without the use of high control gain or extensive computational power. The robustness of the control to unknown external disturbances also leads to a reduction of the design cost as less pre-flight analyses are required. The multiple-loop, multiple time-scale SMC-SMDO flight controller is designed to provide robust position and attitude control of the vehicle while relying only on knowledge of the limits of the disturbances. Extensive simulations of a 6 DOF computer model demonstrate the robustness of the control when faced with external disturbances (including wind, collision and actuator failure) as well as model uncertainties.

AB A nonlinear adaptive framework for bounded-error tracking control of a class of non-minimum phase marine vehicles is presented. The control algorithm relies on a special set of tracking errors to achieve satisfactory tracking performance while guaranteeing stable internal dynamics. First, the design of a model-based nonlinear control law, guaranteeing asymptotic stability of the error dynamics, is presented. This control algorithm solves the tracking problem for the considered class of marine vehicles, assuming full knowledge of the system model. Then, the analysis of the zero-dynamics is carried out, which illustrates the efficacy of the chosen set of tracking errors in stabilizing the internal dynamics. Finally, an indirect adaptive technique, relying on a partial state predictor, is used to address parametric uncertainties in the model. The resulting adaptive control algorithm guarantees Lyapunov stability of the errors and parameter estimates, as well as asymptotic convergence of the errors to zero. Numerical simulations illustrate the performance of the adaptive algorithm. Copyright 2009 (C) John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Infrastructure-assisted cooperative driving, which consists of connected and automated vehicle (CAV) trajectory planning and traffic signal control, can greatly improve the efficiency of signalized intersection operations. In existing studies, the CAV trajectory planning problem is simplified to only modeling longitudinal vehicle behaviors or assuming the lane changing can be executed instantaneously. The generated CAV trajectories are not realistic and can't be implemented at the vehicle level. Instantaneous lane changing process may also lead to safety issues or uncomfortable driving behavior of following vehicles in a mixed traffic environment. To fill this research gap, we propose an optimization framework that integrates a full CAV trajectory planning model with traffic signal control in a cooperative driving environment with both CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). A two-level optimization model is formulated based on discrete time. The high-level model optimizes traffic signal parameters, CAV arrival time, and lane assignment at the stop bar, to minimize total vehicle delay. Given arrival time and lane assignment, the low-level model generates trajectories with integrated car-following and lane-changing maneuvers to mimic a human driving policy based on imitation learning. Numerical experiments from a real-world intersection show that the proposed model outperforms adaptive and fixed time signal control by as much as 63.06% in terms of reduction of average vehicle delay, due to better utilization of lane capacity and reduced lost time. In addition to mobility benefits, fuel consumption is also significantly reduced under the proposed infrastructure-assisted cooperative driving framework.

AB The safety and comfort of drivers have been improved over the decades as a result of our broadened understanding of driver modeling and behavior prediction. Despite these remarkable advances in autonomous and interactive systems, there is a significant lack of approaches that consider the passengers and the vehicle as components of a dynamical vibro-acoustical system. Sound in vehicles is not only informative of the state of the vehicle and the environment, but can also critically affect the driver's performance, attention, and comfort. This paper aims to investigate the interplay between the perceived sounds of a vehicle and psychoacoustic annoyance (PA) metrics. Our goal is to create an intelligent agent that would act to improve driving pleasantness through acoustic-driven learning. To tackle the problem of choosing the correct actions to reduce the acoustic annoyance, the paper presents a method based on reinforcement learning that learns from the environment, i.e., the vehicle interior. The method actively changes the state inside the vehicle (e.g., closing or opening the window and choosing the cruise speed) in order to minimize acoustic annoyance experienced by the driver. The results of this work, performed using the GTA V simulator, showed that the trained agent successfully learned to take the correct actions to reduce PA metrics. The paper also present to the community a new multi-modal dataset composed of several rides on a real vehicle and an in-depth analysis of the influence of vehicle's signal on the acoustic annoyance.

AB This paper addresses modelling, longitudinal control design and implementation for heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs). The challenging problems here are: (a) an HDV is mass dominant with low power to mass ratio; (b) They possess large actuator delay and actuator saturation. To reduce model mismatch, it is necessary to obtain a nonlinear model which is as simple as the control design method can handle and as complicated as necessary to capture the intrinsic vehicle dynamics. A second order nonlinear vehicle body dynamical model is adopted, which is feedback linearizable. Beside the vehicle dynamics, other main dynamical components along the power-train and drive-train are also modelled, which include turbocharged diesel engine, torque converter, transmission, transmission retarder, pneumatic brake and tyre. The braking system is the most challenging part for control design, which contains three parts: Jake (engine compression) brake, air brake and transmission retarder. The modelling for each is provided. The use of engine braking effect is new complementary to Jake (compression) brake for longitudinal control, which is united with Jake brake in modelling. The control structure can be divided into upper level and lower level. Upper level control uses sliding mode control to generate the desired torque from the desired vehicle acceleration. Lower level control is divided into two branches: (a) engine control: from positive desired torque to desired fuel rate (engine control) using a static engine mapping which basically captures the intrinsic dynamic performance of the turbo-charged diesel engine; (b) brake control: from desired negative torque to generate Jake brake cylinder number to be activated and ON/OFF time periods, applied pneumatic brake pressure and applied voltage of transmission retarder. Test results are also reported.

AB The underwater domain is a challenging environment for robotics because widely used electromagnetic devices must be substituted by acoustic equivalents, much slower and noisier. In this paper a two-dimensional pose simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle based on inertial sensors and a mechanical profiling sonar is presented. Two main systems are specially designed. On the one hand, a dead reckoning system based on Lie Theory is presented to track integrated pose uncertainty. On the other hand, a rigid scan matching technique specialized for acoustic data is proposed, which allows one to estimate the uncertainty of the matching result. Moreover, Bayesian-Gaussian mixtures models are introduced to the scan matching problem and the registration problem is solved by an optimization in Lie groups. The SLAM system is tested on real data and executed in real time with the robotic application. Using this system, section maps at constant depth can be obtained from a three-dimensional underwater domain. The presented SLAM system constitutes the first achievement towards an underwater Active SLAM application.

AB This article develops a deep learning object detector to provide accurate six-degree-of-freedom (DoF) information of the drogue relative to a monocular camera onboard a flying unmanned aerial vehicle. An object detector helps to provide the needed information for an autonomous vehicle to dock and refuel without the need for human intervention. This object detector can detect eight different beacons by training on 8746 images of a mock drogue. Once these beacons were detected, a nonlinear least squares algorithm that uses the collinearity equations as a system model takes the beacon's location on the captured image to provide an accurate six-DoF navigation solution. These navigation solutions from the object detector were evaluated on multiple metrics and then compared to navigation solutions provided by a VICON motion tracking system. Finally, Monte Carlo analysis, using the collinearity equations as a system model, evaluates an object detector's performance with various noise levels.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) play very important roles in underwater missions. However, the reliability of the automated recovery of AUVs has still not been well addressed. We propose a vision-based framework for automatically recovering an AUV by another AUV in shallow water. The proposed framework contains a detection phase for the robust detection of underwater landmarks mounted on the docking station in shallow water and a pose-estimation phase for estimating the pose between AUVs and underwater landmarks. We propose a Laplacian-of-Gaussian-based coarse-to-fine blockwise (LCB) method for the detection of underwater landmarks to overcome ambient light and nonuniform spreading, which are the two main problems in shallow water. We propose a novel method for pose estimation in practical cases where landmarks are broken or covered by biofouling. In the experiments, we show that our proposed LCB method outperforms the state-of-the-art method in terms of remote landmark detection. We then combine our proposed vision-based framework with acoustic sensors in field experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness in the automated recovery of AUVs.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES; MOBILE ROBOT; MISSIONS
AB An integrated multiple autonomous underwater vehicle (multi-AUV) dynamic task assignment and path planning algorithm is proposed by combing the improved self-organizing map (SOM) neural network and a novel velocity synthesis approach. Each target is to be visited by one and only one AUV, and a shortest path between a starting point and the destination is found in the presence of the variable current environment and dynamic targets. Firstly, the SOM neuron network is developed to assign a team of AUVs to achieve multiple target locations in dynamic ocean environment. The working process involves special definition of the rule to select the winner, the computation of the neighborhood function, and the method to update weights. Then, the velocity synthesis approach is applied to plan a shortest path for each AUV to visit the corresponding target in dynamic environment subject to the ocean current being variable and targets being movable. Lastly, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, simulation results are given in this paper.

AB Introduction: Automated driving represents both challenges and opportunities in highway safety. Google has been developing self-driving cars and testing them under employee supervision on public roads since 2009. These vehicles have been involved in several crashes, and it is of interest how this testing program compares to human drivers in terms of safety. Methods: Google car crashes were coded by type and severity based on narratives released by Google. Crash rates per million vehicle miles traveled (VMT) were computed for crashes deemed severe enough to be reportable to police. These were compared with police-reported crash rates for human drivers. Crash types also were compared. Results: Google cars had a much lower rate of police-reportable crashes per million VMT than human drivers in Mountain View, Calif, during 2009-2015 (2.19 vs 6.06), but the difference was not statistically significant. The most common type of collision involving Google cars was when they got rear-ended by another (human-driven) vehicle. Google cars shared responsibility for only one crash. Conclusions: These results suggest Google self-driving cars, while a test program, are safer than conventional human-driven passenger vehicles; however, currently there is insufficient information to fully examine the extent to which disengagements affected these results. Practical application: Results suggest that highly-automated vehicles can perform more safely than human drivers in certain conditions, but will continue to beinvolved in crashes with conventionally-driven vehicles.
