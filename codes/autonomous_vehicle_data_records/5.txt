AB Sideline is a key component of fish sensory system, which has been found to affect many behaviours of fish, including manoeuvring obstacle avoidance, prey tracking and environmental mapping in complex fluid environment. In this paper, based on the sensing flow field mechanism of fish lateral line system, a sphere obstacle model is established by using the CFD method and FLUENT software, and the flow field around it is simulated and calculated. The experiment controls two variables: water flow velocity and sphere size. In this paper, the influence of velocity and obstacle size on pressure distribution is analysed, and the rectangular coordinate system is established with the spherical centre as the origin, and the characteristics of pressure distribution inXandYdirections are summarised. This research plays an important role in promoting the development of autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB This study investigates whether the expected travelling and parking behavior of autonomous vehicles (AVs) could lead to positive or negative societal impacts, both in terms of transport and the economy, which have been missed in previous studies. To capture transport performance and economic responses in the AV environment, we develop an integrated transport and economic equilibrium model that consists of the proposed autonomous traffic equilibrium and computable general equilibrium submodels. A modeling framework with a proposed solution methodology is presented to investigate the AV situation. A case study on Sydney, Australia shows that AV parking patterns can cause deterioration in traffic conditions with fewer completed journeys and greater travel time costs, which results in significant losses of social welfare. Furthermore, the disbenefit of AV travel behavior would become even larger with population growth.

AB This paper presents an algorithm for docking a torpedo-shaped autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). We propose a new docking assessment algorithm comprising three phases: depth tracking, docking-feasibility region analysis, and docking-success probability evaluation. For depth-tracking analysis, a neural network-generated path is used to satisfy constrained docking conditions of depth and distance. With regard to docking feasibility region analysis, the working space of the AUV can provide a possibility region of successful docking. In the analysis, working space is expressed by a turning ellipsoid, which is the numerical solution of the maximum yawing motion. An algorithm is presented to evaluate the probability of docking success, based on the probability of sensor data. A good contribution of this approach is that a criterion for assessing the feasibility of the desired path for docking is given through the proposed docking assessment algorithm.

AB In this study, underwater recognition technology and a fuzzy control system were adopted to adjust the attitude and revolution speed of a self-developed autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). To validate the functionality of visual-recognition control, an experiment was conducted in the towing tank at the Department of Systems and Naval Mechatronic Engineering, National Cheng Kung University. An underwater lighting box was towed by a towing carriage at low speed. By adding real-time contour approximation and a circle-fitting algorithm to the image-processing procedure, the relationship between the AUV and the underwater lighting box was calculated. Both rudder plane angles and propeller revolution speeds were determined after the size and location of the lighting box was measured in the image. Finally, AUV performance with visual-recognition control was verified by controlling the target object in the image center during passage.

AB In this paper, multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) is introduced for the conceptual design of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The purpose is to minimize the energy consumption with predefined sailing distance. AUV is decomposed into three disciplines and the coupling relationship is analyzed to build the optimization model. Since drag plays a major role in energy consumption, a hydrodynamic analysis framework is established for drag calculation, consisting of parametric modeling, mesh auto-generation and numerical simulation. In order to complete the optimization effectively, multidisciplinary feasible (MDF) architecture is used and gradient-based optimization algorithm is adopted. Moreover, analytic methods are incorporated into the MDF architecture via gradient to further improve the efficiency of gradient calculation. The optimization result shows that the optimized AUV is much more energy-saving than the initial design and the MDF architecture via coupled analytic methods is quite efficient.

AB Recognizing the potential of autonomous underwater vehicles for scientific and military applications, in 1997 MIT and the NATO Undersea Research Centre initiated a Joint Research Project (GOATS), for the development of environmentally adaptive robotic technology applicable to mine counter measures (MCM) and rapid environmental assessment (REA) in coastal environments. The August 2001 GOATS Conference marked the end of this 5 years project, but did not mark the end of the work. The Centre initiated in 2002 a new long-term programme to explore and demonstrate the operational benefits and performances of AUV for covert preparation of the battlespace. Recently the work addressed the evaluation of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) AUV technology for MCM operations in response to terrorist mining of port. The paper summarizes the work performed and refers to the scientific publications derived from the AUV programme at the NATO Undersea Research Centre. (C) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, we propose an autonomous emergency steering (AES) control strategy for the automated vehicle to avoid collisions with obstacles while maintaining the vehicle's yaw stability. Specifically, by capturing the surrounding traffic environment (i.e., dynamic/static obstacles and lane-road boundary) using an artificial potential field approach, a safe vehicle path trajectory in the form of a polynomial function was generated via Pontryagin's maximum principle (PMP). The generated pathwas complemented by a linear time-varying model predictive control (LTV-MPC) scheme that can predict the state behaviors near the operating points during the prediction horizon. Therefore, the proposed approach can effectively and dynamically adapt to the changes in the system model while respecting the state-and-control constraints. Furthermore, we assumed harsh driving environments where the vehicle drives on a slippery road at a relatively high speed, which may cause lateral instability to the vehicle. Hence, the developed controller has to consider both the vehicle's yaw stability and the path-tracking performance. To achieve this goal, we imposed the adaptive constraints in the designed LTV-MPC, depending on the road surface and driving conditions to prioritize the satisfaction of vehicle yaw stability instead of the path-tracking performance. The proposed approach was verified under various conditions using high-fidelity vehicle dynamics and control testing software (i.e., CarSim). Its effectiveness in vehicle yaw stability and path-tracking performance is compared to conventional baseline approaches.

TI Miniature Autonomy as Means to Find New Approaches in Reliable

DT Article

   physical tests
AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods need to be evaluated thoroughly to ensure reliable behavior. In applications like autonomous driving, a complex environment with an uncountable number of different situations and conditions needs to be handled by a method whose behavior needs to be predictable. To accomplish this, simulations can be used as a first step. However, the physical world behaves differently, as the example of autonomous driving shows. There, erroneous behavior has been found in test drives that was not noticed in simulations. Errors were caused by conditions or situations that were not covered by the simulations (e.g., specific lighting conditions or other vehicle's behavior). However, the problem with real world testing of autonomous driving features is that critical conditions or situations occur very rarely-while the test effort is high. A solution can be the combination of physical world tests and simulations-and miniature vehicles as an intermediate step between both. With model cars (in a sufficiently complex model environment) advantages of both can be combined: (1) low test effort and a repeatable variation of conditions/situations as an advantage like in simulations and (2) (limited) physical world testing with unspecified and potentially unknown properties as an advantage like in real-world tests. Additionally, such physical tests can be carried out in less stable cases like already in the early stages of AI method testing and/or in approaches using online learning. Now, we propose to use a) miniature vehicles at a small scale of 1:87 and b) use sensors and computational power only on the vehicle itself. By this limitation, a further consequence is expected: Here, autonomy methods need to be optimized drastically or even redesigned from scratch. The resulting methods are supposed to be less complex-and, thus, again less error-prone. We call this approach "Miniature Autonomy " and apply it to the road, water, and aerial vehicles. In this article, we briefly describe a small test area we built (3 sqm.), a large test area used alternatively (1,545 sqm.), two last generation autonomous miniature vehicles (one road, one aerial vehicle), and an autonomous driving demo case demonstrating the application.

TI CaT: CAVS Traversability Dataset for Off-Road Autonomous Driving

AB In the context of autonomous driving, the existing semantic segmentation concept strongly supports on-road driving where hard inter-class boundaries are enforced and objects can be categorized based on their visible structures with high confidence. Due to the well-structured nature of typical on-road scenes, current road extraction processes are largely successful and most types of vehicles are able to traverse through the area that is detected as road. However, the off-road driving domain has many additional uncertainties such as uneven terrain structure, positive and negative obstacles, ditches, quagmires, hidden objects, etc. making it very unstructured. Traversing through such unstructured area is constrained by a vehicle's type and its capability. Therefore, an alternative approach to segmentation of the off-road driving trail is required that supports consideration of the vehicle type in a way that is not considered in state-of-the-art on-road segmentation approaches. To overcome this limitation and facilitate the path extraction in the off-road driving domain, we propose traversability concept and corresponding dataset which is based on the notion that the driving trails should be finely resolved into different sub-trails and areas corresponding to the capability of different vehicle classes in order to achieve safe traversal. Based on this, we consider three different classes of vehicles (sedan, pickup, and off-road) and label the images corresponding to the traversing capability of those vehicles. So the proposed dataset facilitates the segmentation of off-road driving trail into three regions based on the nature of the driving area and vehicle capability. We call this dataset as CaT (CAVS Traversability, where CAVS stands for Center for Advanced Vehicular Systems) dataset and is publicly available at https://www.cavs.msstate.edu/resources/downloads/CaT/CaT.tar.gz.

AB Traditional manual spraying systems and even modern automated ones often neglect the critical factors of plant growth stage and coverage density during spraying for plants, which can result in suboptimal yields. To address this issue, this study aims to describe the development of an efficient and affordable autonomous spraying vehicle (ASV) for application in cherry tomato greenhouses. The ASV integrates a visual autonomous spraying system (VASS) and a vehicle control system (VCS). The VASS uses leaf density signalling with machine vision and a vertical spray boom to target leaves for precision spraying application. Leaf density signalling is an algorithm developed to recognise and estimate leaf density by machine, simplifying the real-time determination of leaf density levels in plants. The performance of the algorithm demonstrates an accuracy of 84 % with an average video processing speed of 33.3 ms. The VASS is integrated into VCS to facilitate remote or autonomous navigation. The visual line-following system (VLFS) supports ASV in autonomously navigating between narrow spaced rows in cherry tomato greenhouses, thereby automating the entire spraying process. The analysis of the comprehensive performance of the ASV and the comparative analysis with knapsack sprayers in field experiments are discussed and presented. Comparative analysis with manually operated sprayers demonstrates the better performance of the ASV. These experiments highlight the potential of the ASV to replace traditional manual spraying methods while enhancing spraying precision.

AB Shoreward intrusions of anomalously salty water along the continental shelf of the Middle Atlantic Bight are often observed in spring and summer. Exchange of heat, nutrients, and carbon across the salinity-intrusion front has a significant impact on the marine ecosystem and fisheries. In this article, we developed a method of using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to detect a salinity-intrusion front and track the front's movement. Autonomous front detection is based on the different vertical structures of salinity in the two distinct water types: the vertical difference of salinity is large in the intruding saltier water because of the salinity "tongue" at mid-depth, but is small in the nearshore fresher water due to absence of the salinity anomaly. Every time the AUV crosses and detects the front, the vehicle makes a turn at an oblique angle to cross the front, thus zigzagging through the front to map the frontal zone. The AUV's zigzags sweep back and forth to track the front as it moves over time. From June 25 to 30, 2021, a Tethys-class long-range AUV mapped and tracked a salinity-intrusion front on the southern New England shelf. The frontal tracking revealed the salinity intrusion's 3-D structure and temporal evolution with unprecedented detail.

AB New technologies reaching out for meeting the needs of an aging population in developed countries have given rise to the development and gradual implementation of the concept of an autonomous vehicle (AV) and have even made it a necessity and an important business paradigm. However, in parallel, there is a discussion about consumer preferences and the willingness to pay for new car technologies and intelligent vehicle options. The main aim of the study was to analyze the impact of selected factors on the perception of the future of autonomous cars by respondents from the area of Southeastern Poland in terms of a comparison with traditional cars, with particular emphasis on the advantages and disadvantages of this concept. The research presented in this study was conducted in 2019 among a group of 579 respondents. Data analysis made it possible to identify potential advantages and disadvantages of the concept of introducing autonomous cars. A positive result of the survey is that 68% of respondents stated that AV will be gradually introduced to our market, which confirms the high acceptance of this technology by Poles. The obtained research results may be valuable information for governmental and local authorities, but also for car manufacturers and their future users. It is an important issue in the area of shaping the strategy of actions concerning further directions of development on the automotive market.

AB This paper investigates the integrated optimization of internal powertrain energy management and external vehicles coordination for multiple autonomous and connected hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Most existing research on hybrid vehicles powertrain energy management only considers a single vehicle scenario and is independent from vehicle coordination control. With the advancement of connected and autonomous vehicles, optimizing both the vehicle level coordination and powertrain level power management together can bring in substantial benefits in the overall energy efficiency. In this paper, to enable such an integrated optimization scheme, first, the models of the external vehicle level dynamics and internal powertrain dynamics are built for each vehicle. Second, by integrating the dynamics of these two interactive levels together, an augmented system is formed. Then, the HEVs energy management problem and the decentralized vehicle coordination for a set of HEVs are addressed in a unified framework using dynamic programming. The results show that, as a result of the integrated optimization, the vehicles are able to operate close to the most fuel-efficient region, and the battery can avoid being depleted or over charged while maintaining the same state of charge at the beginning and the end. Moreover, much less fuel consumption can be achieved for the driving cycle considered, compared with the separated optimization method.

AB This article extends theories about sociotechnical imaginaries by analyzing the case of autonomous vehicles (AVs), which suggest a future when humans may no longer need to drive. Drawing on Jasanoff's notion of sociotechnical imaginaries, this article analyzes the ways that this techno-determinist future is created through the claims and actions of corporate and government actors, stabilized in physical spaces at engineering test beds and on urban streets, embedded in popular culture through automotive manufacturers' advertisements, and extended globally as part of the push toward smart cities. However, rather than engaging in merely descriptive or normative discussions of AVs, this project focuses on speculative and generative interventions. Based on a one-year, multidisciplinary project on The Driverless City, this article argues that speculative design interventions offer ways of resisting, disrupting, and destabilizing the normative visions of linear technological progress toward an inevitable autonomous future. This article builds on the growing interest in the field of communications in experimental methodologies for studying the social aspects of emerging technologies.

AB The lane-changing decision-making process is challenging but critical to ensure safe and smooth maneuvers for autonomous vehicles (AVs). Conventional Gipps-type algorithms lack the flexibility for practical use under a mixed autonomous vehicle and human-driven vehicle (AV-HV) environment. Algorithms based on utility ignore the reactions of surrounding vehicles to the lane-changing vehicle. Game theory is a good way to solve the shortcomings of current algorithms, but most models based on game theory simplify the game with surrounding vehicles to the game with the following vehicle in the target lane, which means that the lane-changing decision under a mixed environment is not realized. This paper proposes a lane-changing decision-making model which is suitable for an AV to change lanes under a mixed environment based on a multi-player dynamic game theory. The overtaking expectation parameter (OEP) is introduced to estimate the utility of the following vehicle, OEP can be calculated by the proposed non-lane-based full velocity difference model with the consideration of lateral move and aggressiveness. This paper further proposes a hybrid splitting method algorithm to obtain the Nash equilibrium solution in the multi-player game to obtain the optimal strategy of lane-changing decision for AVs. An adaptive cruise control simulation environment is developed with MATLAB's Simulink toolbox using Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) data as the background traffic flow. The classic bicycle model is used in the control of involved HVs. Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed multi-player dynamic game-based algorithm for lane-changing decision making by AVs under a mixed AV-HV environment.

ID PREDICTION
AB The need for less fuel consumption and the trend of more autonomous vehicles together urge the power optimization in autonomous hybrid vehicles (HVs). However, in most existing research, the vehicle level control and the hybrid powertrain level energy management are treated as separate subjects, and the powertrain management control always follows the required power demand from the vehicle level controller. This fact significantly restricts achieving full fuel saving potential enabled by powertrain hybridization and vehicle autonomy. In this brief, we introduce a flexible power demand architecture, where we give flexibility to the driveline power demand so the powertrain control does not need to exactly track the power demand from the vehicle level. This can give an extra degree of freedom in the powertrain energy management so that better fuel economy can potentially be achieved. The focus of this brief is on a new powertrain management method that can effectively leverage this flexibility. First, the trajectory and power demand are obtained from the vehicle level control and are used as a baseline for hybrid powertrain energy management. Next, the powertrain management with flexible power demand problem is formulated by incorporating the baseline optimal trajectory. Finally, the optimization problem is solved using the Pontryagin's minimum principle. By approximating the optimal instantaneous fuel consumption rate as a polynomial of the engine speed, the optimal conditions can be converted into a set of algebraic equations. To verify the efficacy of the proposed methodology, a motivating numerical example of multiple connected HVs in pursuit of a leader vehicle is considered.

To this end, we develop a mixed-integer linear programming model to describe the interaction between traffic lights and discretized traffic flow. It is based on a microscopic traffic model with centrally controlled autonomous vehicles. We aim to determine a globally optimal traffic flow for given scenarios on a simple, but extensible, urban road network. The resulting models are very challenging to solve, in particular when involving additional realistic traffic-light regulations such as minimum red and green times. While solving times exceed real-time requirements, our model allows an estimation of the maximum performance gains due to improved communication and serves as a benchmark for heuristic and decentralized approaches.

AB Autonomous driving technologies often use state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms to understand the relationship between the vehicle and the external environment, to predict the changes of the environment, and then to plan and control the behaviors of the vehicle accordingly. The complexity of such technologies makes it challenging to evaluate the performance of autonomous driving systems and to find ways to improve them. The current approaches to evaluating such autonomous driving systems largely use a single score to indicate the overall performance of a system, but domain experts have difficulties in understanding how individual components or algorithms in an autonomous driving system may contribute to the score. To address this problem, we collaborate with domain experts on autonomous driving algorithms, and propose a visual evaluation method for autonomous driving. Our method considers the data generated in all components during the whole process of autonomous driving, including perception results, planning routes, prediction of obstacles, various controlling parameters, and evaluation of comfort. We develop a visual analytics workflow to integrate an evaluation mathematical model with adjustable parameters, support the evaluation of the system from the level of the overall performance to the level of detailed measures of individual components, and to show both evaluation scores and their contributing factors. Our implemented visual analytics system provides an overview evaluation score at the beginning and shows the animation of the dynamic change of the scores at each period. Experts can interactively explore the specific component at different time periods and identify related factors. With our method, domain experts not only learn about the performance of an autonomous driving system, but also identify and access the problematic parts of each component. Our visual evaluation system can be applied to the autonomous driving simulation system and used for various evaluation cases. The results of using our system in some simulation cases and the feedback from involved domain experts confirm the usefulness and efficiency of our method in helping people gain in-depth insight into autonomous driving systems.

AB The main goal of this study was to investigate the impact of four dimensions of technological readiness on the adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs): Discomfort, insecurity, optimism, and innovativeness. This study confirmed that reasons for (against) adoption of technology are also important determinants of the intention to use AVs with the moderating effect of social influence on technological readiness and reasons for (against) adoption AVs are also investigated. Thus, this research adds to the existing literature on AVs adoption by establishing the important roles of consumers' technological readiness and social influence through their behavioral reasoning processes. For business practitioners and marketers, the findings provide guidelines for developing marketing strategies that fit an individual customers' level of adoption.

AB The high efficiency of obstacle detection system (ODS) is essential to obtain the high performance of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) carrying out a mission in a complex underwater environment. Based on the previous literature analysis, that include path planning and collision avoidance algorithms, the solutions which operation was confirmed by tests in a real-world environment were selected for this paper consideration. These studies were subjected to a deeper analysis assessing the effectiveness of the obstacle detection algorithms. The analysis shows that over the years, ODSs being improved and provide greater detection accuracy that results in better AUV response time. Almost all analysed methods are based on the conventional approach to obstacle detection. In the future, even better ODSs parameters could be achieved by using artificial intelligence (AI) methods.

AB This article presents a novel path planning algorithm for autonomous land vehicles. There are four main contributions: Firstly, an evaluation standard is introduced to measure the performance of different algorithms and to select appropriate parameters for the proposed algorithm. Secondly, a guideline generated by human or global planning is employed to develop the heuristic function to overcome the shortcoming of traditional A-Star algorithms. Thirdly, for improving the obstacle avoidance performance, key points around the obstacle are employed, which would guide the planning path to avoid the obstacle much earlier than the traditional one. Fourth, a novel variable-step based A-Star algorithm is also introduced to reduce the computing time of the proposed algorithm. Compared with the state-of-the-art techniques, experimental results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is robust and stable.

AB Noise radiated from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is one of the major sources of interference that impact the acoustic performance of its towed array sensor, especially during passive detection under low ambient noise conditions. In this paper, an adaptive noise canceller (ANC) based on the partitioned fast block least-meansquare adaptive algorithm is designed and applied to mitigate the AUV-radiated noise to improve the detection performance of a linear array towed by an AUV platform. The gain, defined as the ratio of the output signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) to the input SNR, is taken as the metric for our ANC. Results obtained from processing the experimental data indicate that the gain of the ANC is up to 20 dB.

AB This paper presents a robust path tracking control method by utilizing the ideology of constraint-following approach for uncertain underactuated autonomous vehicles. The uncertainties are bounded with an unknown boundary. They do not all fall within the range space of the input matrix. Based on kinematic relations between the desired path and vehicle, the path tracking task is transformed into an equality constraint of the vehicle lateral dynamics states. The control goal is to make the underactuated vehicle follow the constraint, thus realizing the desired tracking performance. The constraint-following robust control (CFRC) is designed in two steps. First, a servo control design for the nominal system is devised without considering uncertainty and initial constraint deviation. Second, the uncertainty is meticulously decomposed into matched and mismatched portions based on the geometric structural characteristics of the constraint dynamics system. As a result, since the mismatched uncertainty is orthogonal to the constraint-following geometric space, it ``disappears'' in the stability analysis. The matched uncertainty is estimated by a self-adjusting leakage type adaptive law. On this basis, a robust control is designed based on the estimated matched uncertainty. Through Lyapunov minimax analysis, the proposed control method guarantees the approximate constraint-following performance. Finally, the TruckSim-Simulink co-simulations and real vehicle experiments are presented. The results show that the proposed control can robustly realize excellent tracking performance in the presence of time-vary uncertainties.

AB This article addresses the problem of state estimation and simultaneous learning of the vehicle's tire model on autonomous vehicles. The problem is motivated by the fact that lateral distance measurements are typically available on modern vehicles while tire models are difficult to identify and also vary with time. Tire forces are modeled in the estimator using a neural network in which no a priori assumptions on the type of model need to be made. A neuro-adaptive observer that provides asymptotically stable estimation of the state vector and of the neural network weights is developed. The developed observer is evaluated using both MATLAB simulations with a low-order model as well as with an unknown high-order model in the commercial software CarSim. Cornering and lane change maneuvers are used to learn the tire model over an adequately large range of slip angles. Performance with the low-order vehicle model is excellent with near-perfect estimation of states as well as the tire force nonlinear characteristics. The performance with the unknown high-order CarSim model is also found to be good with the tire model being estimated correctly over the range of slip angles excited by the executed vehicle maneuvers. The developed technology can enable a new approach to obtaining tire models that are otherwise difficult to identify in practice and depend on empirical characterizations.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE
AB In a connected vehicle environment based on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) technology, images from front and ego vehicles are fused to augment a driver's or autonomous system's visual field, which is helpful in avoiding road accidents by eliminating the blind point (the objects occluded by vehicles), especially tailgating in urban areas. Realizing multi-view image fusion is a tough problem without knowing the relative location of two sensors and the fusing object is occluded in some views. Therefore, we propose an image geometric projection model and a new fusion method between neighbor vehicles in a cooperative way. Based on a 3D inter-vehicle projection model, selected feature matching points are adopted to estimate the geometric transformation parameters. By adding deep information, our method also designs a new deep-affine transformation to realize fusing of inter-vehicle images. Experimental results on KIITI (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute) datasets are shown to validate our algorithm. Compared with previous work, our method improves the IoU index by 2~3 times. This algorithm can effectively enhance the visual perception ability of intelligent vehicles, and it will help to promote the further development and improvement of computer vision technology in the field of cooperative perception.

AB In this work, we develop a reactive algorithm for autonomous exploration of indoor, unknown environments for multiple autonomous multi-rotor robots. The novelty of our approach rests on a two-level control architecture comprised of an Artificial-Harmonic Potential Field (AHPF) for navigation and a low-level tracking controller. Owing to the AHPF properties, the field is provably safe while guaranteeing workspace exploration. At the same time, the low-level controller ensures safe tracking of the field through velocity commands to the drone's attitude controller, which handles the challenging non-linear dynamics. This architecture leads to a robust framework for autonomous exploration, which is extended to a multi-agent approach for collaborative navigation. The integration of approximate techniques for AHPF acquisition further improves the computational complexity of the proposed solution. The control scheme and the technical results are validated through high-fidelity simulations, where all aspects, from sensing and dynamics to control, are incorporated, demonstrating the capacity of our method in successfully tackling the multi-agent exploration task.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB This paper outlines a predictive maneuver-planning method for autonomous vehicle navigating public highway traffic. The method integrates discrete maneuvering decisions, i.e., lane and reference speed selection automata, with a model predictive control-based motion trajectory-planning scheme. A key notion is to apply a predictive reference speed pre-planning for each lane at each time step of a selected prediction horizon. This is done based on the predicted likely motion of the autonomous vehicle and other object vehicles subject to sensor noise and environmental disturbances. Then, an optimization problem is configured that computes safe, sub-optimal plans for the trajectories of both the motion states (and inputs) and maneuver references for the prediction horizon to accomplish maneuvers like lane keeping, lane change, or obstacle avoidance. While a first formulation of the problem results in a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, it is shown that a relaxation can be adopted that reduces the computational complexity to a low-order polynomial time nonlinear program that can he solved more efficiently. Through simulation of a series of multi-lane highway scenarios and comparison with one-maneuver planning approach and an adaptive cruise control approach, the proposed predictive maneuver planning is illustrated to better accommodate the traffic environment with feasible execution time. Also, the reference speed pre-planning improves the optimality and the robustness of the maneuver decision in trajectory planning without adding computational complexity to the optimization problem.

AB Currently, the driver plays a crucial role in the safety of autonomous vehicles, functioning as the fall back for vehicle control systems. Fast and accurate detection of driver intervention is therefore of importance. In this article a novel driver intervention detection method for automated vehicles is presented and tested. Non-critical transitions are considered, excluding safety related applications. The transfer function between the electric power steering torque and steering column angle is estimated by perturbing the steering system with a known disturbance. This estimated value is used to detect whether a driver is intervening. The detection algorithm has been tested in simulations using a four degree-of-freedom vehicle model. The parameters of this vehicle model have been obtained via frequency response measurements performed on a test vehicle. Secondly, the performance of the algorithm has been tested with on-road measurements. The results show that driver intervention can be successfully detected within 0.4 seconds. The performance in terms of true and false detections has been analyzed, and the presented solution is shown to be robust to measurement noise and road disturbances.

AB Autonomous, or self-driving, cars are emerging as the solution to several problems primarily caused by humans on roads, such as accidents and traffic congestion. However, those benefits come with great challenges in the verification and validation (V&V) for safety assessment. In fact, due to the possibly unpredictable nature of Artificial Intelligence (AI), its use in autonomous cars creates concerns that need to be addressed using appropriate V&V processes that can address trustworthy AI and safe autonomy. In this study, the relevant research literature in recent years has been systematically reviewed and classified in order to investigate the state-of-the-art in the software V&V of autonomous cars. By appropriate criteria, a subset of primary studies has been selected for more in-depth analysis. The first part of the review addresses certification issues against reference standards, challenges in assessing machine learning, as well as general V&V methodologies. The second part investigates more specific approaches, including simulation environments and mutation testing, corner cases and adversarial examples, fault injection, software safety cages, techniques for cyber-physical systems, and formal methods. Relevant approaches and related tools have been discussed and compared in order to highlight open issues and opportunities.

AB In this paper, we examine the issues associated with docking autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operating within an Autonomous Ocean Sampling Network (AOSN). We present a system based upon an acoustic ultrashort baseline system that allows the AUV to approach the dock from any direction. A passive latch on the AUV and a pole on the dock accomplish the task of mechanically docking the vehicle. We show that our technique for homing is extremely robust in the face of the two dominant sources of error-namely the presence of currents and the presence of magnetic anomalies. Our strategy for homing is independent of the initial bearing of the dock to the AUV, includes a method for detecting when the vehicle has missed the dock, and automatically ensures that the AUV is in a position to retry homing with a greater chance of success. Our approach is seen to be extremely successful in homing the vehicle to the dock, mechanically attaching itself to the dock, aligning inductive cores for data and power transfer, and undocking at the start of a fresh mission. Once the AUV is on the dock, we present a methodology that allows us to achieve the complex tasks with ensuring that the AUV is securely docked, periodically checking vehicle status, reacting to a vehicle that requires charging, tracking it when it is out on a mission, archiving and transmitting via satellite the data that the AUV collects during its missions, as well as providing a mechanism for researchers removed from the site to learn about vehicle status and command high-level missions. The dock is capable of long-term deployments at a remote site while respecting the constraints-low power, small size, low computational energy, low bandwidth, and little or no user input-imposed by the amalgamation of acoustic, electronic and mechanical components that comprise the entire system.

AB Over the last decade, there has been rising interest in automated driving systems and adaptive cruise control (ACC). Controllers based on reinforcement learning (RL) are particularly promising for autonomous driving, being able to optimize a combination of criteria such as efficiency, stability, and comfort. However, RL-based controllers typically offer no safety guarantees. In this paper, we propose SECRM (the Safe, Efficient, and Comfortable RL-based car-following Model) for autonomous car-following that balances traffic efficiency maximization and jerk minimization, subject to a hard analytic safety constraint on acceleration. The acceleration constraint is derived from the criterion that the follower vehicle must have sufficient headway to be able to avoid a crash if the leader vehicle brakes suddenly. We critique safety criteria based on the time-to-collision (TTC) threshold (commonly used for RL controllers), and confirm in simulator experiments that a representative previous TTC-threshold-based RL autonomous-vehicle controller may crash (in both training and testing). In contrast, we verify that our controller SECRM is safe, in training scenarios with a wide range of leader behaviors, and in both regular-driving and emergency-braking test scenarios. We find that SECRM compares favorably in efficiency, comfort, and speed-following to both classical (non-learned) car-following controllers (intelligent driver model, Shladover, Gipps) and a representative RL-based car-following controller.

AB Predicting the trajectories of surrounding vehicles by considering their interactions is an essential ability for the functioning of autonomous vehicles. The subsequent movement of a vehicle is decided based on the multiple maneuvers of surrounding vehicles. Therefore, to predict the trajectories of surrounding vehicles, interactions among multiple maneuvers should be considered. Recent research has taken into account interactions that are difficult to express mathematically using data-driven deep learning methods. However, previous studies have only considered the interactions among observed trajectories due to subsequent maneuvers that are unobservable and numerous maneuver combinations. Thus, to consider the interaction among multiple maneuvers, this paper proposes a hierarchical graph neural network. The proposed hierarchical model approximately predicts the multiple maneuvers of vehicles and considers the interaction among the maneuvers by representing their relationships in a graph structure. The proposed method was evaluated using a publicly available dataset and a real driving dataset. Compared with previous methods, the results of the proposed method exhibited better prediction performance in highly interactive situations.

AB In upcoming years, the introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs) will reshape the transport system. The transition from a regular to an autonomous transport system, however, will take place over many years and lead to a long period with a mixed driving environment where AVs and regular vehicles (RVs) operate side by side. The purpose of this study is to investigate how the utilisation of the road capacity degrades as a function of heterogeneity in congested motorways. The analysis is based on a dedicated traffic simulator, which enables the investigation of complex dynamic spillback from congestion while allowing for different degrees of heterogeneity. The representation of autonomous vehicles is based on a modified intelligent driver model (IIDM) presented by Treiber et al. (Phys Rev E 62(2):1805-1824, 2000) and Treiber and Kesting (Traffic flow dynamics, Springer, Heidelberg, 2013), while the behaviour of drivers of RVs relies on a stochastic version of the IIDM. Three main conclusions stand out. Firstly, it is shown that in an idealised environment in which AVs operate alone, a substantially improved capacity utilisation can be attained. Secondly, when drivers of RVs are mixed with AVs, capacity utilisation degrades very fast as a function of the share of RVs. Thirdly, it is shown that the improved capacity utilisation of AVs comes in the form of reduced travel time and increased throughput, with indications that travel time reductions are the most important. From a strategical planning perspective, the results underline that dedicated lanes are preferable to attain the positive effects of AVs. Specifically, we compare a stylised situation with three lanes with a share of 33% AVs to a situation with two regular lanes and a single dedicated AV lane. The latter represents a tripling in consumer surplus all other things being equal.

AB The rapid advancement in the Internet of Things (IoT) and its integration with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are expected to play a crucial role in future Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Additionally, the continuous progress in the industry of autonomous vehicles will accelerate and increase their short adoption in smart cities to allow safe, sustainable and accessible trips for passengers in different public and private means of transportation. In this article, we investigate the adoption of 5G different technologies, mainly, the Software-Defined Networks (SDN) to support the communication requirements of delegation of control of level-2 autonomous vehicles to the Remote-Control Center (RCC) in terms of ultra-low delay and reliability. This delegation occurs upon the detection of a drowsy driver using our proposed deep-learning-based technique deployed at the edge to reduce the level of accidents and road congestion. The deep learning-based model was evaluated and produced higher accuracy, precision and recall when compared to other methods. The role of SDN is to implement network slicing to achieve the Quality of Service (QoS) level required in this emergency case. Decreasing the end-to-end delay required to provide feedback control signals back to the autonomous vehicle is the aim of deploying QoS support available in an SDN-based network. Feedback control signals are sent to remotely activate the stopping system or to switch the vehicle to direct teleoperation mode. The mininet-WiFi emulator is deployed to evaluate the performance of the proposed adaptive SDN framework, which is tailored to emulate radio access networks. Our simulation experiments conducted on realistic vehicular scenarios revealed significant improvement in terms of throughput and average Round-Trip Time (RTT).

AB The rapid advancement of connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technologies, although possibly years away from wide application to the general public travel, are receiving attention from many state Departments of Transportation (DOT) in the niche area of using autonomous maintenance technology (AMT) to reduce fatalities of DOT workers in work zone locations. Although promising results are shown in testing and deployments in several states, current autonomous truck mounted attenuator (ATMA) system operators are not provided with much practical driving guidance on how to drive these new vehicle systems in a way that is safe to both the public and themselves. To this end, this manuscript aims to model and develop a set of rules and instructions for ATMA system operators, particularly when it comes to critical locations where essential decision making is needed. Specifically, three technical requirements are investigated: car-following distance, critical lane-changing gap distance, and intersection clearance time. Newell's simplified car-following model, and the classic lane-changing behavior model are modified, with roll-ahead distance taken into account, to model the driving behaviors of the ATMA vehicles at those critical decision-making locations. Data are collected from real-world field testing to calibrate and validate the developed models. The modeling outputs suggest important thresholds for ATMA system operators to follow. For example, on a freeway with a speed limit of 70 mph and ATMA operating speed of 10 mph, car-following distance should be no less than 75 ft for the lead truck and 100 ft for the follower truck, the critical lane-changing gap distance is 912 ft, and a minimum intersection clearance is 15 s, which are all much higher than the requirements for a general vehicle.

AB Heterogeneous autonomous vehicle (HAV) coordinated motion planning must guide each vehicle out of the conflict zone based on the differences in vehicle platform characteristics. Decomposing complex driving tasks into primitives is an effective way to improve algorithm efficiency. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to complete the coordinated motion planning tasks through offline driving behavior primitive (DBP) library generation, online extension and selection of DBPs. The proposed algorithm applies dynamic movement primitives and singular value decomposition to learn driving behavior patterns from driving data, integrates them into a model-based optimization generation method as constraints, and builds a DBP library by fusing driving data and vehicle model. Based on the generated DBP library and primitive association probabilities learned from labeled driving segments via stochastic context-free grammar, the planning method completes the independent DBP extension of each vehicle in the conflict zone, generates an interaction DBP tree, and uses the mixed-integer linear programming algorithm to optimally select the primitives to be executed. This study demonstrates that the generated DBP library not only expands the types of primitives, but also distinguishes the characteristics of HAVs. We also present how to utilize the DBP libraries to obtain coordinated motion planning results with spatiotemporal information in the form of DBP extension and selection. The results obtained by real vehicle platforms and simulation show that the proposed method can accomplish coordinated motion planning tasks without relying on specific scene elements and highlight the unique motion characteristics of HAVs.

ID SELF-DRIVING CARS
AB The computer vision systems driving autonomous vehicles are judged by their ability to detect objects and obstacles in the vicinity of the vehicle in diverse environments. Enhancing this ability of a self-driving car to distinguish between the elements of its environment under adverse conditions is an important challenge in computer vision. For example, poor weather conditions like fog and rain lead to image corruption which can cause a drastic drop in object detection (OD) performance. The primary navigation of autonomous vehicles depends on the effectiveness of the image processing techniques applied to the data collected from various visual sensors. Therefore, it is essential to develop the capability to detect objects like vehicles and pedestrians under challenging conditions such as like unpleasant weather. Ensembling multiple baseline deep learning models under different voting strategies for object detection and utilizing data augmentation to boost the models' performance is proposed to solve this problem. The data augmentation technique is particularly useful and works with limited training data for OD applications. Furthermore, using the baseline models significantly speeds up the OD process as compared to the custom models due to transfer learning. Therefore, the ensembling approach can be highly effective in resource-constrained devices deployed for autonomous vehicles in uncertain weather conditions. The applied techniques demonstrated an increase in accuracy over the baseline models and were able to identify objects from the images captured in the adverse foggy and rainy weather conditions. The applied techniques demonstrated an increase in accuracy over the baseline models and reached 32.75% mean average precision (mAP) and 52.56% average precision (AP) in detecting cars in the adverse fog and rain weather conditions present in the dataset. The effectiveness of multiple voting strategies for bounding box predictions on the dataset is also demonstrated. These strategies help increase the explainability of object detection in autonomous systems and improve the performance of the ensemble techniques over the baseline models.

AB Autonomous vehicles heavily rely on various sensors to evaluate their surroundings and issue essential control commands. Nonetheless, these sensors are susceptible to false data injection and spoofing attacks, posing a significant security threat. In response, this paper proposes a channel-spatial-temporal attention-based autoencoder network to detect sensor spoofing attacks on autonomous vehicles. The innovative network utilizes the reconstruction error based on the autoencoder to detect abnormalities in input time series data collected from multiple sensors. The proposed model consists of a memory-augmented based spatial-attention block and PSE-Res2Net block-based encoder and decoder. PSE-Res2Net block initially adopts Res2Net module to generate a multi-scale feature graph and enhance multi-dimensional representation ability of neural network, then applies the PSENet module to capture location-aware channel information and channel-sensitive spatial information through the interaction of channel attention and spatial attention. Moreover, the memory-augmented based temporal-attention block is developed to integrate multi-scale features and aggregate global sequence information of sensor measurements. Experimental evaluations conducted on the comma2k19, KITTI, and CCSAD datasets illustrate the superiority of the proposed detection model over baseline technologies. It exhibits enhanced performance in terms of mPre, mRe, mF1 score, and showcases heightened resilience against noise and attacks.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AV) have become a symbol of futuristic and intelligent transport innovation. This new driving technology has received heightened attention from academic, public, and private sectors. Nonetheless, a big challenge limiting a clear understanding of AV research is its scale. A large volume of literature is produced-covering various fields. This paper aims to map out the research on AV for a better understanding of the trends, patterns, and interconnections, and it critically reflects on their implications for research. A scientometric analysis technique is applied to analyze 4,645 papers published between 1998 and 2017. The findings disclose that (a) 87.7 percent of the AV studies was conducted by educational institutes; (b) Europe is the most productive continent in AV research with a 35.9 percent share of publications; (c) North America is the most influential continent in AV research, receiving 41.1 percent of the citations; (d) Over 50 percent of the studies were conducted during the last three years of the analysis period; (e) Urban and social contexts of AV research are still at their early stage; and (f) Relatively limited collaboration and knowledge sharing between academia and industry exist.

AB Simple and efficient geometric controllers, like Pure-Pursuit, have been widely used in various types of autonomous vehicles to solve tracking problems. In this paper, we have developed a new pursuit method, named CF-Pursuit, which has been based on Pure-Pursuit but with certain differences. In CF-Pursuit, in order to reduce fitting errors, we used a clothoid C-1 curve to replace the circle employed in Pure-Pursuit. This improvement to the fitting method helps the Pursuit method to decrease tracking errors. As regards the selection of look-ahead distance, we employed a fuzzy system to directly consider the path's curvature. There are three input variables in this fuzzy system, 6mcurvature, 9mcurvature and 12mcurvature, calculated from the clothoid fit with the current position and the goal position on the defined path. A Sugeno fuzzy model was adapted to output a reasonable look-ahead distance using the experiences of human drivers as well as our own tests. Compared with some other geometric controllers, CF-Pursuit performs better in robustness, cross track errors and stability. The results from field tests have proven the CF-Pursuit is a practical and efficient geometric method for the path tracking problems of autonomous vehicles.

AB A core issue inherent to decision-making and path-planning tasks is managing the uncertainties in the motion of dynamic obstacles. Therefore, this article proposes a new decision-making and path-planning framework, based on game theory, that considers the multistate future actions of surrounding vehicles. First, multistate future actions of neighboring vehicles, whose driving styles vary, are estimated and fed into a decision-making module for risk assessment. Then, based on the Stackelberg game theory, the ego vehicle and the rear object vehicle are modeled as two players in the game, and their optimal decisions are obtained. In addition, the path-planning model incorporates a potential-field model that utilizes several potential functions to explain the varied styles and physical limitations of the surrounding vehicles. Finally, the trajectory of the ego vehicle is obtained through model predictive control that is based on the outputs of the decision-making and constructed potential-field models. The results of simulation experiments that used designed scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method effectively manages various social interactions and generates safe and appropriate trajectories for autonomous vehicles. In addition, the simulation results demonstrate that considering multistate trajectories caused the decision-making and path-planning modules to be appropriate for unpredictable environmental conditions.
   This approach first estimates the multimodal trajectories of traffic agents, whose driving styles vary. Then, decision-making module considers the existing and intentional risk generating different constraints. Agents' optimal decisions are obtained through game theory and potential field models for simultaneously achieving well generalization and interpretation capabilities. Finally, the trajectory of the ego vehicle is obtained through model predictive control.image & COPY; 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

ID MANAGEMENT; DESIGN
AB In millimeter wave (mmWave) vehicular communications, multi-hop relay disconnection by line-of-sight (LOS) blockage is a critical problem, particularly in the early diffusion phase of mmWave-available vehicles, where not all vehicles have mmWave communication devices. This paper proposes a distributed position control method to establish long relay paths through road side units (RSUs). This is realized by a scheme via which autonomous vehicles change their relative positions to communicate with each other via LOS paths. Even though vehicles with the proposed method do not use all the information of the environment and do not cooperate with each other, they can decide their action (e.g., lane change and overtaking) and form long relays only using information of their surroundings (e.g., surrounding vehicle positions). The decision-making problem is formulated as a Markov decision process such that autonomous vehicles can learn a practical movement strategy for making long relays by a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. This paper designs a learning algorithm based on a sophisticated deep reinforcement learning algorithm, asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C), which enables vehicles to learn a complex movement strategy quickly through its deep-neural-network architecture and multi-agent-learning mechanism. Once the strategy is well trained, vehicles can move independently to establish long relays and connect to the RSUs via the relays. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method can increase the relay length and coverage even if the traffic conditions and penetration ratio of mmWave communication devices in the learning and operation phases are different.

AB This paper addresses the provision of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) once autonomous vehicles become available, putting special emphasis on the cost structures of MaaS-providers. The results show the existence of significant economies of scale and, therefore, the market is likely to become a natural monopoly. The difference with the current situation is explained by the absence of a driver and it provides an explanation for the aggressive and deficitary expansion strategies of current TNC providers. Furthermore, given that natural monopolies require regulation in order to avoid losses of social welfare, the paper considers five different regulation scenarios. For this purpose, we also take into account the existence of negative and positive externalities as well as other issues specific to the provision of MaaS, such as spatio-temporal considerations and complementarity/competition with other transport modes.

AB Robust localization is an essential capability for autonomous land vehicles. While a lot of work focused on structured environments, this article focuses on navigation in off-road environments. In the off-road environment, due to the lack of salient features, scan matching algorithms tend to degenerate. Therefore, the first contribution of this paper is to propose a reliable degeneracy indicator which can evaluate the scan matching performance. The evaluated degeneracy indicator is then integrated into the factor graph optimization framework which is used in both the offline mapping system and the online localization system. Moreover, a complete navigation system that can handle the incomplete and partly outdated LiDAR maps is developed. Extensive tests on real-world data sets show that the proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, especially in degenerate scenarios.

AB This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous extinguishing of indoor fires inside a building by a Micro-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (MAV). In particular, controlling and estimating the MAV state, detection of a building entrance, multi-modal MAV localization during the outdoor-indoor transition, interior motion planning and exploration, fire detection and position estimation, and fire extinguishing are discussed. The performance of these elements, as well as of the entire integrated system, are evaluated in simulations and field tests in various demanding real-world conditions. The system presented here is part of a complex multi-MAV solution that won the MBZIRC 2020 competition, and is being used as the core of a fire-fighting Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) industrial platform under development.

AB This paper describes a set of software modules and algorithms for obstacle avoidance. The approach described here is designed to work in conjunction with any path planning method that generates a viable sequence of waypoints, with obstacle avoidance regarded as a local deviation of the planned path of points. The helm architecture used here will temporarily spawn a new obstacle avoidance behavior for each near detected obstacle, and generate a maneuvering objective function to avoid the obstacle. Once the vehicle passes the obstacle, the helm deletes the behavior and frees its memory space. The helm, obstacle manager, and obstacle avoidance behavior are described here. This software arrangement was used by the MIT 2014 RobotX team, and will be included in the next software release of the open source MOOS-IvP marine autonomy project.

AB This paper proposes an algorithm for resolution of traffic conflicts occurring on an intersection, intended for Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV). The algorithm is based on the trade-off between energy consumption and user-defined value of time. The consequent cooperation opportunities originating from agent heterogeneity are captured by a game-theoretic cooperative-competitive solution approach to develop a computationally feasible, self-enforced, cooperative intersection de-conflicting algorithm. It is intended as a component of a robust framework for strategic control of the vehicle's powertrain. Monte Carlo simulation is used to showcase the decision-making algorithm's behaviour, to estimate its efficiency as a function of traffic heterogeneity. The results confirm that the proposed algorithm may offer threefold improvement in energy and time efficiency in relation to a First Come First Served scheme.

AB Underwater navigation is a challenging task for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), which requires to estimate the position and orientation of the vehicle. Accelerometer-based attitude estimation is problematic as its accuracy can degrade by up to two orders of magnitude when the AUV is accelerating. Pressure sensors, which are unaffected by acceleration, offer an efficient alternative for determining orientation. This paper offers a method for pitch-and-roll estimation using a network of pressure sensors and a thorough analysis of the method's accuracy including analytical evaluation and the Cramer-Rao lower bound. Then, the method is tested in a simulation. We also provide a way to estimate system performance based on the vehicle's size and the number and accuracy of the sensors.

AB With the severe traffic situation in recent years as the background, there are intensive studies on the inter-vehicle communication system, aiming at the safety improvement of the road traffic system and the smooth control of the traffic flow. The spread-spectrum communication is very useful in the realization of such a system since the data for the distance between vehicles are obtained, which is very important in driving the vehicle, as well as the communication.
   This paper considers the intervehicle communication network using the spread-spectrum system and proposes the medium access control (MAC) protocol for the autonomous distributed access control. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, a computer simulation is executed for the environment where the vehicles um freely on a highway. It is shown that stable information exchange can be realized with vehicles running in nearby positions.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AV) hold a significant promise in creating a positive disruption of transportation. However, the majority of people perceive AV with fear, anxiety and public resistance. Our study aims to examine how controllability mediates the relationships between main personality traits (sensation seeking and big five), and AV acceptance. In a cross-sectional study, we found that low desirability of control and high external driving locus of control are associated with high AV acceptance. Moreover. We found that individuals high in sensation seeking, perceive high external driving locus of control, and low desirability to control, which in turn leads to low AV acceptance. In addition, the desirability of control and external driving locus mediated the relationships between extraversion, conscientiousness and neuroticism with AV acceptance. Overall, our results support the hypothesized model and suggest that for people to trust AV they need to have some sense of controlling the vehicle.

AB Road potholes can cause discomforts to passengers and even traffic accidents to vehicles. Accurate segmentation of road potholes is an important capability for autonomous vehicles to ensure safe driving. Some methods on road-pothole segmentation use single-modal data (i.e., RGB images). The main challenge faced by these methods is that the visual appearance of road potholes is often close to road areas, making these networks difficult to distinguish them. Recent methods resort to fusing RGB images with depth/disparity images for pothole segmentation. However, their performance is still not satisfactory in real-world applications. To achieve superior results, this article proposes a novel data fusion network for road-pothole segmentation, where a channel attention fusion module and a dual attention fusion (DAF) module are designed to hierarchically fuse the RGB and disparity data. We evaluate our proposed network using a public dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority over the state-of-the-art networks.

AB This paper proposes a visual-inertial navigation system (VINS) combined with a dynamic object detection (DOD) algorithm, to improve the localization and state estimate accuracy of autonomous driving vehicles (ADV) in dynamic environments. Firstly, based on the YOLOv5 network, we train the proposed DOD model to detect dynamic objects in the road environment. Secondly, by removing the feature points in the dynamic object regions, we track the remaining feature points to eliminate the influence of the dynamic object. Furthermore, we model the global positioning system (GPS) measurement as a general factor and introduce its residual factor into the cost function to eliminate the cumulative error. Finally, we validate the performance of the proposed method on public datasets and real-world experiments. The results show that the proposed method can effectively eliminate the influence of the dynamic object and eliminate the cumulative error. It provides theoretical guidance for ADV navigation in dynamic or large-scale outdoor environments.

AB The present study examined whether the non-chronological age factor, engagement in physical exercise, affected responses to multimodal (combinations of visual, auditory, and/or tactile) signals differently between younger and older adults in complex environments. Forty-eight younger and older adults were divided into exercise and non-exercise groups, and rode in a simulated Level 3 autonomous vehicle under four different task conditions (baseline, video watching, headway estimation, and video-headway combination), while being asked to respond to various multimodal warning signals. Overall, bi- and trimodal warnings had faster response times for both age groups across driving conditions, but was more pronounced for older adults. Engagement in physical exercise was associated with smaller maximum braking force for younger participants only, and also corresponded to longer average fixation durations, compared to the non-exercise group. Findings from this research can help to guide decisions about the design of warning and information systems for semi-autonomous vehicles.

AB Improving endurance is important for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) as it affects the operational cost and application range of the vehicle. In this article, we propose an economic model predictive control (EMPC)-based controller to reduce the control energy of AUVs while performing waypoint tracking. The proposed EMPC controller optimizes stage costs capturing the control energy consumed within the prediction horizon and a terminal cost approximating the energy-to-go, the energy required to reach the desired waypoint from the end of the prediction horizon. To approximate the energy-to-go, we partition it into the dynamic and static segments based on the operational characteristics of the optimal vehicle maneuver obtained from off-line trajectory optimization using direct collocation (DC). To account for the disturbances caused by ocean currents, we adopt the energy-to-go to a virtual Earth-fixed frame that transforms the drift in the vehicle location to the drift in the desired waypoint. Theoretical and numerical analyses of the approximated energy-to-go reveal that the proposed controller can balance the tradeoffs among energy components spent for vehicle surge, heave, and yaw controls in consideration of vehicle dynamics. Simulations under different flow conditions are conducted to compare the proposed approach with DC and a line-of-sight (LOS) guidance-based approach that optimizes vehicle surge speed for energy minimization. Through simulations, it is shown that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal performance as DC and outperforms the LOS-based approach.

AB We consider the problem of verifying the safety of the trajectories of a camera-based autonomous vehicle in a given 3-D-scene. We give a procedure to verify that all trajectories starting from a given initial region reach a specified target region safely without colliding with obstacles on the way. We also give a prioritization-based falsification procedure that collects unsafe trajectories. Both our procedures are based on the key notion of image-invariant regions, which are regions within which the captured images are identical. We evaluate our methods on a model of an autonomous road-following drone in a variety of 3-D-scenes; our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of our approach for both safety analysis and falsification.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are closely connected in the Cooperative Intelligent Transportation System (C-ITS). They are equipped with various sensors and controlled by Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) to provide high-level autonomy. The vehicles exchange different types of real-time data with each other, which can help reduce traffic accidents and congestion, and improve the efficiency of transportation systems. However, when interacting with the environment, AVs suffer from a broad attack surface, and the sensory data are susceptible to anomalies caused by faults, sensor malfunctions, or attacks, which may jeopardize traffic safety and result in serious accidents. In this paper, we propose ADS-Lead, an efficient collaborative anomaly detection methodology to protect the lane-following mechanism of ADSs. ADS-Lead is equipped with a novel transformer-based one-class classification model to identify time series anomalies (GPS spoofing threat) and adversarial image examples (traffic sign and lane recognition attacks). Besides, AVs inside the C-ITS form a cognitive network, enabling us to apply the federated learning technology to our anomaly detection method, where the vehicles in the C-ITS jointly update the detection model with higher model generalization and data privacy. Experiments on Baidu Apollo and two public data sets (GTSRB and Tumsimple) indicate that our method can not only detect sensor anomalies effectively and efficiently but also outperform state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods.

AB This paper describes the design of a high integrity navigation system for use in large autonomous mobile vehicles. A frequency domain model of sensor contributions to navigation system performance is used to study the performance of a conventional navigation loop. On the basis of this, a new navigation system structure is introduced which is capable of detecting faults in any combination of navigation sensors. An example implementation of these principles is described which employs a twin GPS/IMU MMW radar/encoder navigation loop.

AB Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) is a system of inter-connectivity and communication between smart automated vehicles. Blockchain has emerged as a technology focusing on data security with a decentralized architecture and has been successful to a very high degree. Unfortunately, this technology was not originally meant for low-power IoT devices and is very computationally expensive with high power requirements and a tendency to introduce delays. With the explosion of the Internet of Things (IoT) enabled autonomous vehicles, boosted further by the advent of smart cities, energy requirements have become an issue that can no longer be ignored. As a consequence, research into green technologies has been gaining popularity. With this area of focus, blockchain with its exponential power consumption levels is heavily flawed and thus presents itself as a prime candidate for improvement. In this paper, a framework is proposed to further evolve blockchain technology to integrate it with a semi-centralized data storage mechanism, while keeping network control decentralized. The proposed Blockchain Tree (BCT) approach entails a combination of a tree structure network composed of blockchains, based on a time-based upward data propagation mechanism that optimizes the architecture to reduce communication delay, cut down its high power consumption levels and ensure sustainability in the long run. As is evident in the comparative study, such a blockchain-based network structure offers drastic improvements in terms of speed, energy savings, storage and computation. The proposed model reduces the storage requirement of the blockchain by a factor of 0.17. The energy requirements and time complexity have been optimized by approximately 195% in the early stages of optimization. All the parameters get further optimized by orders of magnitude with more transactions and users.

AB Nowadays, the potential benefits and implementation of autonomous driving have attracted widespread attention from both industry and academia. This study will solve view-invariant object detection and semantic key-point pose assumptions from a single RGB image. A machine learning method for estimating the absolute pose of an on-road vehicle for autonomous driving from monocular vision alone without the help of additional sensors is a complex task. The main purpose of this work is to identify other vehicles on the road and estimate their exact angular position from a single image with improved accuracy. The focus of the study is to create a new algorithm by applying a potentially deep convoluted neural network followed by a repetitive neural structure for more accurate 6D pose inference. A 6D pose hypothesis is presented in this study, based on a deep hybrid architecture for individual vehicles of an end-to-end approach to a task consisting of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). In this work, we will use a large-scale dataset consistent with the understanding of a 3D car instance called ApolloCar3D. The data set contains 5,277 real -life street scenes with examples of about 60K cars. By comparison, the ApolloCar3D is twenty times larger than the PASCAL3D+ and KITTI datasets. Ultimately, the idea is to efficiently eliminate motionless cars and predict the next pose given in the speed context, allowing a comprehensive evaluation, and passing the output through LSTM (long short-term memory) with an additional filter layer. The new filter added to the LSTM will efficiently filter and isolate stationary or parking vehicles and focus on on-road vehicles. Since the LSTM has a non-linear high-dimensional hidden memory state, it can preserve the past continuity of each generation's data history and pay more attention to those road vehicles rather than parked or stationary vehicles to act accordingly. So for each new vehicle, the pose estimator classifier can use LSTM memory and compare the historical pose with the newly filtered data. The successful implementation of this innovative concept will lead to significant improvements in the real-life traffic situation in the field of computer vision and autonomous driving.

AB Automated vehicles (AVs) have begun to receive tremendous interest among researchers and decision-makers because of their substantial safety and mobility benefits. Although much research has been reported regarding the implications of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) technologies for highway capacity, to our knowledge, evaluations of the impacts of AVs are rare. AVs can be divided into two categories, cooperative and autonomous. Cooperative AVs, unlike Autonomous AVs, can communicate with other vehicles and infrastructure, thereby providing better sensing and anticipation of preceding vehicles' actions, which would have an impact on traffic flow characteristics. This paper proposes an analytical framework for quantifying and evaluating the impacts of AVs on the capacities of highway systems. To achieve this goal, the behavior of AVs technologies incorporated on the car-following and lane-merging modules in the traffic micro-simulation model, based on which an estimate of the achievable capacity is derived. To consider the period before AVs account for a majority of the vehicles in traffic networks, the proposed model considers combinations of vehicles with varying market penetration. The results indicate that a maximum lane capacity of 6,450 vph per lane (300% improvement) is achievable if all vehicles are driven in a cooperative automated manner. Regarding the incorporation of autonomous AVs into the traffic stream, the achievable capacity appears highly insensitive to market penetration. The results of this research provide practitioners and decision-makers with knowledge regarding the potential capacity benefits of AVs with respect to market penetration and fleet conversion.

AB The development of advanced technologies has led to the emergence of autonomous vehicles. Herein, autonomous public transport (APT) systems equipped with prioritization measures are being designed to operate at ever faster speeds compared to conventional buses. Innovative APT systems are configured to accommodate prevailing passenger demand for peak as well as non-peak periods, by electronic coupling and decoupling of platooned units along travel corridors, such as the dynamic autonomous road transit (DART) system being researched in Singapore. However, there is always the trade-off between high vehicle speed versus passenger ride comfort, especially lateral ride comfort. This study analyses a new APT system within the urban context and evaluates its performance using microscopic traffic simulation. The platooning protocol of autonomous vehicles was first developed for simulating the coupling/decoupling process. Platooning performance was then simulated on VISSIM platform for various scenarios to compare the performance of DART platooning under several ride comfort levels: three bus comfort and two railway criteria. The study revealed that it is feasible to operate the DART system following the bus standing comfort criterion (a(y) = 1.5 m/s(2)) without any significant impact on system travel time. For the DART system operating to maintain a ride comfort of the high-speed train (HST) and light rail transit (LRT), the delay can constitute up to approximate to 10% and approximate to 5% of travel time, respectively. This investigation is crucial for the system delay management towards precisely designed service frequency and improved passenger ride comfort.

AB Autonomous driving is one of the most interesting topics inside the area of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS); the automatic control of the steering wheel is one of the most important challenges which researches face M this area. This work presents an adjustment based on genetic algorithms of fuzzy controllers capable of handling automatically the steering wheel of a conventional vehicle, reproducing attitudes of a human driver in different situations. To do that, the state of the car has been monitored while it is led by a human being and by means of genetic algorithms there has been obtained a fuzzy controller suitable for the managing of the steering wheel of the vehicle. All bearing two basic requirements in mind: the controller must be capable of handling the vehicle across a predefined route and of executing soft control actions to provide a comfortable conduction for the vehicle's occupants.

AB Path planning and formation control are two of the most significant concepts which can be considered in multi-vehicle systems and particularly in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The cooperative implementation of complicated commands would lead to desirable results and increase the probability of success in the missions. Due to the nonlinear dynamics and environmental conditions, the cooperative control of AUVs is a challenging topic. The developments in AUV applications demonstrate the significance of research and development in path planning and formation control. Unlike ground or aerial autonomous vehicles, this field of study has not attracted considerable attention and further exploration is required as a result. The present paper reviews the different structures of formation control in AUVs and discusses their advantages and disadvantages. Besides formation control, the cooperative path planning of AUVs along with the limitations specific to the cooperative structure is taken into consideration in the present study. Moreover, avoiding any obstacle collision and preventing any encounter between group members are considered as critical issues in the formation control and cooperative path planning. Some areas are still open to investigation as implied by the technological suggestions, which will facilitate future research. At the end of the article, a simulated sample is given of the triangular formation path planning for AUVs.

AB Autonomous driving technologies are expected to affect shared mobility; therefore, the discussions on new business models using shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and their feasibilities are underway. This study analyzes consumer preference and willingness to pay for an SAV service, focusing on the automation level of the shared vehicle and liability for an accident, to investigate who will use the SAV service and how much. For this, we conducted a conjoint survey with 1,000 South Koreans and estimated the consumer utility function for an SAV service using a multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model. The results show that consumer utility increases when the SAV automation level is higher and the liability for an accident lies with the SAV service provider. Moreover, we find that potential consumers have different preferences regarding the liability of a car accident according to their sociodemographic characteristics. We also analyze choice probability and usage of SAV services according to autonomous driving technology levels and who is held liable for an accident. The results show that people with a higher income prefer to use SAV service if service providers are responsible for an accident. Contrarily, older people, drivers, and people with a low income prefer to use SAV service if the accident's liability lies with the automobile manufacturer. We also find that SAV service usage increases when the level of autonomous driving technology is high or liability for an accident lies with the SAV service provider or automobile manufacturer.

In this article, in consideration of the unknown ocean environment and real-time dynamic obstacle avoidance problem, the collision avoidance controller using a velocity resolution method and backstepping tracking controller based on unmanned surface vehicle maneuvering motion model is designed. Simulation results show that the method is effective and accurate and can provide the reference for the unmanned surface vehicle intelligent collision avoidance control technology.

AB Three-dimensional vehicle detection using LiDAR point clouds is important for the stability of autonomous driving. It can provide high-quality three-dimensional information for most obstacles. Although efficient algorithms based on a Bird's Eye View (BEV) feature map have been developed, many research issues still remain; in particular, the existing methods show a limited accuracy in estimating the rotation angle of a 3D object. In this paper, to improve the accuracy of rotation angle estimation, we propose a rotation-aware 3D vehicle detector that extracts distinguishable features from the proposals with various angles of rotations. Experiments are conducted on KITTI dataset and Waymo Open dataset. Our approach improves detection accuracy as well as rotation angle estimation accuracy against the existing algorithms without much loss of computational efficiency.

DT Article
AB A method for the autonomous geolocation of ground vehicles in forest environments is presented. The method provides an estimate of the global horizontal position of a vehicle strictly based on finding a geometric match between a map of observed tree stems, scanned in 3D by Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) sensors onboard the vehicle, to another stem map generated from the structure of tree crowns analyzed from high resolution aerial orthoimagery of the forest canopy. The method has been tested with real-world data and has been able to estimate vehicle geoposition with an average error of less than 2 m. The method has two key properties that are significant: (a) The algorithm does not require a priori knowledge of the area surrounding the robot, and (b) Based on estimated vehicle state, it uses the geometry of detected tree stems as the only input to determine horizontal geoposition.

AB Determining an appropriate time to execute a lane change is a critical issue for the development of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs).However, few studies have considered the rear and the front vehicle-driver's risk perception while developing a human-like lane-change decision model. This paper aims to develop a lane-change decision model for AVs and to identify a two level threshold that conforms to a driver's perception of the ability to safely change lanes with a rear vehicle approaching fast. Based on the signal detection theory and extreme moment trials on a real highway, two thresholds of safe lane change were determined with consideration of risk perception of the rear and the subject vehicle drivers, respectively. The rear vehicle's Minimum Safe Deceleration (MSD) during the lane change maneuver of the subject vehicle was selected as the lane change safety indicator, and was calculated using the proposed human-like lane-change decision model. The results showed that, compared with the driver in the front extreme moment trial, the driver in the rear extreme moment trial is more conservative during the lane change process. To meet the safety expectations of the subject and rear vehicle drivers, the primary and secondary safe thresholds were determined to be 0.85 m/s(2) and 1.76 m/s(2), respectively. The decision model can help make AVs safer and more polite during lane changes, as it not only improves acceptance of the intelligent driving system, but also further ensures the rear vehicle's driver's safety.

AB This paper proposes a method for creating a path for parking autonomous vehicles regardless of the distance and the position of the parking space, using a vehicle with sensor performance superior to existing ultrasonic and camera-based sensors. While conventional methods have a limited parking detectionarea, the proposed method has a greater free parking detection area. In addition, to follow the generated path, a new tracking algorithm was employed tofollow the path. And then, in order to eliminate the 'Path following error' caused by the difference between the steering speed and the vehicle speed, it used a new algorithm for the longitudinal controller to perform perfect parking. This paper then experimentally shows to demonstrate a path planning andpath tracking method for the Auto Valet Parking System.

AB This paper studies the lateral and longitudinal path tracking control of four-wheel steering autonomous vehicles. A robust and adaptive fault-tolerant tracking control strategy is proposed to simultaneously counteract modeling uncertainties, unexpected disturbances, coupling effects, as well as actuator failures. By introducing the virtual points along the longitudinal centerline of the vehicle and utilizing a state transformation, a special feature of the control gain matrix is revealed, which allows for the development of structurally simple and computationally inexpensive robust adaptive and fault-tolerant control algorithms. The closed-loop stability issues of the control scheme are analyzed using a Lyapunov-based method. A nonlinear dynamic model of a passenger vehicle is developed to simulate the performance of control design. The controller is tested and validated via computer simulations in the presence of parametric uncertainties and varying driving conditions.

AB Mobile robots are no longer used exclusively in research laboratories and indoor controlled environments, but are now also used in dynamic industrial environments, including outdoor sites. Mining is one industry where robots and autonomous vehicles are increasingly used to increase the safety of the workers, as well as to augment the productivity, efficiency, and predictability of the processes. Since autonomous vehicles navigate inside tunnels in underground mines, this kind of navigation has different precision requirements than navigating in an open environment. When driving inside tunnels, it is not relevant to have accurate self-localization, but it is necessary for autonomous vehicles to be able to move safely through the tunnel and to make appropriate decisions at its intersections and access points in the tunnel. To address these needs, a topological navigation system for mining vehicles operating in tunnels is proposed and validated in this paper. This system was specially designed to be used by Load-Haul-Dump (LHD) vehicles, also known as scoop trams, operating in underground mines. In addition, a localization system, specifically designed to be used with the topological navigation system and its associated topological map, is also proposed. The proposed topological navigation and localization systems were validated using a commercial LHD during several months at a copper sub-level stoping mine located in the Coquimbo Region in the northern part of Chile. An important aspect to be addressed when working with heavy-duty machinery, such as LHDs, is the way in which automation systems are developed and tested. For this reason, the development and testing methodology, which includes the use of simulators, scale-models of LHDs, validation, and testing using a commercial LHD in test-fields, and its final validation in a mine, are described.

AB Throughout the last century, the automobile industry achieved remarkable milestones in manufacturing reliable, safe, and affordable vehicles. Because of significant recent advances in computation and communication technologies, autonomous cars arc becoming a reality. Already autonomous car prototype models have covered millions of miles in test driving. Leading technical companies and car manufacturers have invested a staggering amount of resources in autonomous car technology, as they prepare for autonomous cars' full commercialization in the coming years. However, to achieve this goal, several technical and nontechnical issues remain: software complexity, real-time data analytics, and testing and verification are among the greater technical challenges; and consumer stimulation, insurance management, and ethical/moral concerns rank high among the nontechnical issues. Tackling these challenges requires thoughtful solutions that satisfy consumers, industry, and governmental requirements, regulations, and policies. Thus, here we present a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art results for autonomous car technology. We discuss current issues that hinder autonomous cars' development and deployment on a large scale. We also highlight autonomous car applications that will benefit consumers and many other sectors. Finally, to enable cost-effective, safe, and efficient autonomous cars, we discuss several challenges that must be addressed (and provide helpful suggestions for adoption) by designers, implementers, policymakers, regulatory organizations, and car manufacturers.

ID ROAD; VEHICLES
AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to play a key role in the future of transportation, and to introduce a disruptive yet potentially beneficial change for wildlife-vehicle interactions. However, this assumption has not been critically examined, and reducing the number of wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) may be beyond current technological capabilities. Here, we introduce a conceptual framework encompassing the intersection between AV technology and wildlife conservation to reduce WVCs. Our proposed framework integrates the development of robust warning systems and animal detection methods for AV systems, and the incorporation of wildlife-vehicle interactions into decision-making algorithms. With large-scale AV deployment a looming reality, it is vital to incorporate conservation and sustainability into the societal, ethical, and legal implications of AV technology. We intend our framework to help ecologists and conservationists foster the necessary interdisciplinary collaborations with AV developers and policy makers to reduce WVCs and concomitant biodiversity loss.

The dynamics of each AUV system involves parameter variations, nonlinear dynamics, and external disturbances. A robust distributed formation control protocol is developed based on the graph theory and the robust compensation theory. It is proven that the tracking errors of the global uncertain system can converge into a given neighborhood of the origin in a finite time. Simulation results substantiate the effectiveness of the developed formation control method for multiple AUVs subject to nonlinearities and uncertainties.

AB This article proposes a novel decision-making framework for autonomous vehicles (AVs), called predictor-corrector potential game (PCPG), composed of a predictor and a corrector. To enable human-like reasoning and characterize agent interactions, a receding-horizon multiplayer game is formulated. To address the challenges caused by the complexity of solving a multiplayer game and by the requirement of real-time operation, a potential game (PG)-based decision-making framework is developed in the PG predictor, where the agents' cost functions are heuristically predefined. We acknowledge that the behaviors of other traffic agents, for example, human-driven vehicles and pedestrians, may not necessarily be consistent with the predefined cost functions. To address this issue, a best response-based PG corrector is designed. In the corrector, the action deviation between the ego vehicle prediction and the surrounding agents' actual behaviors are measured and are fed back to the ego vehicle decision-making, to correct the prediction errors caused by the inaccurate predefined cost functions and to improve the ego vehicle strategies. Distinguished from most existing game-theoretic approaches, this PCPG: 1) deals with multiplayer games and guarantees the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (PSNE) and the convergence of the PSNE-seeking algorithm; 2) is computationally scalable in a multiagent scenario; 3) guarantees the ego vehicle safety under suitable conditions; and 4) approximates the actual PSNE of the system despite the unknown cost functions of others. Comparative studies between the PG, the PCPG, and the control barrier function (CBF)-based approaches are conducted in diverse traffic scenarios, including oncoming traffic scenarios and multivehicle intersection-crossing scenarios. The results from validation case studies based on a naturalistic dataset are reported.

AB Driving cessation for some older adults can exacerbate physical, cognitive, and mental health challenges due to loss of independence and social isolation. Fully autonomous vehicles may offer an alternative transport solution, increasing social contact and encouraging independence. However, there are gaps in understanding the impact of older adults' passive role on safe human-vehicle interaction, and on their well-being. 37 older adults (mean age +/- SD = 68.35 +/- 8.49 years) participated in an experiment where they experienced fully autonomous journeys consisting of a distinct stop (an unexpected event versus an expected event). The autonomous behavior of the vehicle was achieved using the Wizard of Oz approach. Subjective ratings of trust and reliability, and driver state monitoring including visual attention strategies (fixation duration and count) and physiological arousal (skin conductance and heart rate), were captured during the journeys. Results revealed that subjective trust and reliability ratings were high after journeys for both types of events. During an unexpected stop, overt visual attention was allocated toward the event, whereas during an expected stop, visual attention was directed toward the human-machine interface (HMI) and distributed across the central and peripheral driving environment. Elevated skin conductance level reflecting increased arousal persisted only after the unexpected event. These results suggest that safety-critical events occurring during passive fully automated driving may narrow visual attention and elevate arousal mechanisms. To improve in-vehicle user experience for older adults, a driver state monitoring system could examine such psychophysiological indices to evaluate functional state and well-being. This information could then be used to make informed decisions on vehicle behavior and offer reassurance during elevated arousal during unexpected events.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicle technologies are expected to alter transportation systems by enhancements in mobility, safety, and emission reduction. While many studies have investigated the impacts of connected vehicle (CV) and autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies on traffic congestion and emission at the facility level, little is known about these impacts at large scales. Furthermore, different effective parameters associated with these impacts, such as the extra vehicle miles traveled (VMT) induced by AVs, technology cost of these vehicles, and possible reductions in the value of time of AV users, are highly uncertain. The uncertainty of these parameters and its role in assessing the societal impacts of CVs and AVs are not fully explored in the literature. Therefore, this study aims to develop a stochastic framework and an optimization algorithm to find the optimum market shares of CVs and AVs in a mixed traffic environment, consisting of human-driven vehicles without connectivity (HDVs), CVs, and AVs, minimizing the system cost. Emission, travel time, and technology costs are considered as components of the system cost. Thus, the framework combines a traffic simulation tool that considers a mixed fleet of HDVs, CVs, and AVs with heterogeneous drivers (for HDVs and CVs) distributed spatially over the network, along with an emission estimation model, to measure network-wide travel time and emission costs. Many parameters, such as extra VMT produced by AVs, value of time reduction for AV users, and automation cost, are subject to a considerable degree of stochasticity, which is considered by assuming probabilistic distributions for these parameters. A Bayesian Optimization algorithm with heteroskedastic non-stationary Gaussian process model is presented to estimate the optimum market shares of CVs and AVs considering these uncertainties. The stochastic framework and the optimization algorithm are successfully applied to a large-scale network of Chicago. The impacts of different parameters on the optimum CV and AV market shares and the system cost are explored, providing practical insights for policymakers.

ID TRAJECTORY TRACKING; SYSTEMS; BACKING
AB In the past few years, there has been a growing interest among researchers in developing control systems for autonomous vehicles, specifically for tractor-trailer systems. This newfound interest is driven by the potential benefits of enhancing safety, reducing costs, and addressing labor shortages in the industry. Two industries that could reap the rewards of these systems' advancements are cargo and agriculture transportation. One of the challenging tasks for the truck trailer vehicle is driving in reverse. Backward path tracking of tractor-trailers is a complex control problem with practical applications. The difficulty in controlling the vehicle arises due to its unstable internal dynamics, coupled nonlinear terms, and the under-actuated nature of the system. There is also a limit to the angle at which the steering can be turned before the risk of a jackknife accident increases significantly. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces a robust sliding mode controller designed for path tracking in reverse-driving tractor-trailer systems. The novelty of our work lies in addressing these challenges, which have not been extensively studied in the past. The proposed controller is analyzed, and its performance is tested and verified using different scenarios. The simulation examples show superior control performance, and we anticipate that this novel controller holds the potential to be widely adopted as a fundamental component in the path-tracking algorithms of autonomous truck trailer systems.

ID TUTORIAL
AB Autonomous vehicle self-localization must be robust to environment changes, such as dynamic objects, variable illumination, and atmospheric conditions. Topological maps provide a concise representation of the world by only keeping information about relevant places, being robust to environment changes. On the other hand, semantic maps correspond to a high level representation of the environment that includes labels associated with relevant objects and places. Hence, the use of a topological map based on semantic information represents a robust and efficient solution for large-scale outdoor scenes for autonomous vehicles and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). In this work, a novel topological semantic mapping and localization methodology for large-scale outdoor scenarios for autonomous driving and ADAS applications is presented. The methodology uses: (i) a deep neural network for obtaining semantic observations of the environment, (ii) a Topological Semantic Map (TSM) for storing selected semantic observations, and (iii) a topological localization algorithm which uses a Particle Filter for obtaining the vehicle's pose in the TSM. The proposed methodology was tested on a real driving scenario, where a True Estimate Rate of the vehicle's pose of 96.9% and a Mean Position Accuracy of 7.7[m] were obtained. These results are much better than the ones obtained by other two methods used for comparative purposes. Experiments also show that the method is able to obtain the pose of the vehicle when its initial pose is unknown.

AB This paper presents a model predictive control (MPC)-based algorithm for rollover prevention of an autonomous electric road sweeper (AERS). For AERS, the basic function of autonomous driving is a path- and velocity-tracking control needed to make a vehicle follow given path and velocity profiles. On the other, the AERS adopts an articulated frame steering (AFS) mechanism which can make cornering behavior agile. Moreover, the tread of the AERS is narrow, and the height of the mass center is high. As a result, it is prone to roll over. For this reason, it is necessary to design a controller for path and velocity tracking and rollover prevention in order to improve maneuverability and roll safety of the AERS. A kinematic model was adopted as a vehicle one for the AERS. With the vehicle model, reference states of position and velocity were determined that are needed to make the AERS track the reference path and prevent rollover. With the vehicle model and reference states, an MPC-based motion controller was designed to optimize articulation angle and velocity commands. The load-transfer ratio (LTR) was used to measure a rollover propensity. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, a simulation was conducted for the U-turn scenario. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm improves path tracking and prevents the rollover of the AERS.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB We present an analytical model for an autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval system (AVS/RS). The system is modeled as a semi-open queueing network (SOQN). An SOQN consists of customers, a secondary resource and servers. Each arriving customer is paired with the secondary resource. The two visit the set of servers required by the customer in the specified sequence. In the context of an AVS/RS, storage/retrieval (S/R) transactions are customers and the autonomous vehicles are the secondary resources. If an S/R transaction requires a vertical movement, it uses a lift. The lifts and horizontal travel times to and from a storage space are modeled as servers. First, we define all possible scenarios for storage and retrieval transactions and their occurrence probabilities. Second, we derive general travel times of vehicles and lifts by considering all possible locations of the two devices based on the predefined storage and retrieval scenarios, defined in step 1. Third, each scenario is modeled as a customer type and these customer classes are aggregated into a single class. Thus, we model the system as a single-class, multiple-server, SOQN. Finally, we solve the SOQN using an approximate method and obtain the performance measures. We apply the method to analyze a warehouse in France that utilizes AVS/RS.

AB This paper presents a novel approach for improving the safety of vehicles equipped with Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) by making use of Machine Learning (ML) and physical knowledge. More exactly, we train a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm that makes use of physical knowledge such as the jam-avoiding distance in order to automatically adjust the ideal longitudinal distance between the ego- and leading-vehicle, resulting in a safer solution. In our use case, the experimental results indicate that the physics-guided (PG) RL approach is better at avoiding collisions at any selected deceleration level and any fleet size when compared to a pure RL approach, proving that a physics-informed ML approach is more reliable when developing safe and efficient Artificial Intelligence (AI) components in autonomous vehicles (AVs).

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles are now considered an integral part of modern military operations. One of the challenging issues in future unmanned aerial vehicles operations is autonomous aerial refueling, which will raise the current unmanned aerial vehicle mission boundaries set by vehicle endurance and range limitations. Aerial refueling is considered a routine procedure for human operators, but for unmanned aerial vehicle applications, it requires a high level of autonomous technologies based on solid recognition of the overall refueling system design principles. In this paper, the aerodynamic characteristics of a paradrogue assembly in a hose-drogue-probe type of aerial refueling system are investigated through wind-tunnel experiments and computational fluid dynamics simulation analysis. In particular, the drag characteristics of a paradrogue assembly with various component geometric configurations (struts and canopy) are studied. An empirical model based upon a statistical design methodology is constructed, which allows prediction of the drag coefficient of a paradrogue assembly upon these configuration changes.

AB Object tracking is an essential aspect of environmental perception technology for autonomous vehicles. The existing object tracking algorithms can only be applied well to simple scenes. When the scenes become complex, the algorithms have poor tracking performance and insufficient robustness, and the problems of tracking drift and object loss are prone to occur. Therefore, a robust object tracking algorithm for autonomous vehicles in complex scenes is proposed. Firstly, we study the Siam-FC network and related algorithms, and analyze the problems that need to be addressed in object tracking. Secondly, the construction of a double-template Siamese network model based on multi-feature fusion is described, as is the use of the improved MobileNet V2 as the feature extraction backbone network, and the attention mechanism and template online update mechanism are introduced. Finally, relevant experiments were carried out based on public datasets and actual driving videos, with the aim of fully testing the tracking performance of the proposed algorithm on different objects in a variety of complex scenes. The results showed that, compared with other algorithms, the proposed algorithm had high tracking accuracy and speed, demonstrated stronger robustness and anti-interference abilities, and could still accurately track the object in real time without the introduction of complex structures. This algorithm can be effectively applied in intelligent vehicle driving assistance, and it will help to promote the further development and improvement of computer vision technology in the field of environmental perception.

The challenge is to generate an efficient path for the vehicle given a probabilistic description of potential target locations. We propose an algorithm that generates an efficient path and show that the algorithm is superior to standard approaches. Hardware implementation and field experiments using this algorithm are presented using a REMUS-100 autonomous underwater vehicle on simulated targets. The use of this algorithm is compared to two baseline methods of performing a multiple-aspect coverage mission. The field experiments imply that the proposed algorithm is superior in speed to the baseline methods. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Road edge drop-off has well known impacts on the safety of the traveling public and roadway service life. Continuous inspection of roadsides is therefore needed to monitor their condition. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are increasing in number and have the potential to be used for road and roadside condition data collection. This study explored the use of AVs to assess road edge drop-off. To this end, the ability and accuracy of a research grade autonomous vehicle platform built on a passenger car was used to determine road edge drop-off. Data were collected for the roadside along a state highway in Ohio using the different sensors of the vehicle platform, including a Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) sensor. A 160-m (525-ft) long section of the highway was selected and surveyed using a high accuracy stationary terrestrial laser scanner to obtain the topographic map of the highway and its sides. The lidar data were analyzed using fully automated deep learning methods to determine the edge drop-off severity along the selected section. The analyzed lidar data were compared with those obtained using the high accuracy stationary terrestrial laser scanner. The results of this study showed that the autonomous vehicle platform can be used successfully to assess the road edge drop-off with excellent accuracy, particularly when using end-to-end deep learning methods for analyzing the collected data.

ID TRAFFIC CONTROL; APPROXIMATION; SYSTEMS
AB We study intersection access control for autonomous vehicles. Platoon forming algorithms, which aim to organize individual vehicles in platoons, are very promising. To create those platoons, we slow down vehicles before the actual arrival at the intersection in such a way that each vehicle can traverse the intersection at high speed. This increases the capacity of the intersection significantly, offering huge potential savings with respect to travel time compared to nowadays traffic. We propose several new platoon forming algorithms and provide an approximate mean delay analysis for our algorithms. A comparison between the current day practice at intersections (through a case study in SUMO) and our proposed algorithms is provided. Simulation results for fairness are obtained as well, showing that platoon forming algorithms with a low mean delay sometimes are relatively unfair, indicating a potential need for balancing mean delay and fairness.

AB In this paper, we consider the problem of coordinating a collection of autonomous unmanned vehicles while guaranteeing collision avoidance. Each vehicle is regulated by a local controller that ensures stability and provides desired path tracking performance in the absence of constraints. The fulfillment of coordination tasks (e.g., collision avoidance) and local constraints (e.g., input saturation constraints) is achieved through a command governor (CG) strategy that, whenever necessary, modifies the nominal paths of the vehicles. First, a centralized CG approach is proposed and fully analyzed. Then, a more interesting distributed implementation requiring low communication rates is discussed. Both approaches make use of a receding horizon strategy and require the on-line solution of mixed-integer optimization programs. Finally, an example is given for illustration purposes.

AB We propose a practical local and global path-planning algorithm for an autonomous vehicle or a car-like robot in an unknown semi-structured (or unstructured) environment, where obstacles are detected online by the vehicle's sensors. The algorithm utilizes a probabilistic method based on particle filters to estimate the dynamic obstacles' locations, a support vector machine to provide the critical points and Bezier curves to smooth the generated path. The generated path safely travels through various static and moving obstacles and satisfies the vehicle's movement constraints. The algorithm is implemented and verified on simulation software. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in complicated scenarios that posit the existence of multi moving objects.

TI A Deep Coordination Graph Convolution Reinforcement Learning for
   Multi-Intelligent Vehicle Driving Policy

ID VOLTAGE CONTROL
AB With the growing up of Internet of Things technology, the application of Internet of Things has been popularized in the field of intelligent vehicles. Therefore, more artificial intelligence algorithms, especially DRL methods, are more widely used in autonomous driving. A large number of deep reinforcement learning (RL) technologies are continuously applied to the behavior planning module of single-vehicle autonomous driving in early. However, autonomous driving is an environment where multi-intelligent vehicles coexist, interact with each other, and dynamically change. In this environment, multiagent RL technology is one of the most promising technologies for solving the coordination behavior planning problem of multivehicles. However, the research related to this topic is rare. This paper introduces a dynamic coordination graph (CG) convolution technology for the cooperative learning of multi-intelligent vehicles. This method dynamically constructs a CG model among multiple vehicles, effectively reducing the impact of unrelated intelligent vehicles and simplifying the learning process. The relationship between intelligent vehicles is refined using the attention mechanism, and the graph convolution RL technology is used to simulate the message-passing aggregation algorithm to maximize the local utility and obtain the maximum joint utility to guide coordination learning. Driving samples are used as training data, and the model guided by reward shaping is combined with the model of the free graph convolution RL method, which enables our proposed method to achieve high gradualness and improve its learning efficiency. In addition, as the graph convolutional RL algorithm shares parameters between agents, it can easily build scales that are suitable for large-scale multiagent systems, such as traffic environments. Finally, the proposed algorithm is tested and verified for the multivehicle cooperative lane-changing problem in the simulation environment of autonomous driving. Experimental results show that our proposed method has better value function representation in that it can learn better coordination driving policies than traditional dynamic coordination algorithms.

ID TRANSPORTATION PLANS; AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; URBAN; OBJECTIVES; GROWTH
AB Emerging technologies such as autonomous vehicles, connected vehicles, and the internet of things are rapidly advancing. Testing of autonomous vehicles is being undertaken in 24 cities across the U.S.A., and an additional 74 cities worldwide (1). The introduction and expansion of these new modes of transport and supporting technologies will have vast implications for social equity, depending on planning practices and policymaking. This paper explores how 20 metropolitan planning organizations prepare for emerging technologies and consider their implications for equity. A qualitative content analysis of Regional Transportation Plans (RTPs) was conducted looking for evidence of these efforts. It found that 80% of plans included planning for social equity beyond the current environmental justice requirements, 70% mentioned emerging technologies, and 20% considered the equity implications of those technologies. The results showed promising practices from a number of areas, with the Southern California Association of Governments leading the way in addressing both equity and emerging technology planning; and the RTP of Madison, WI providing the best consideration of the equity implications of emerging technologies.

AB Vehicular communications, referring to information exchange among vehicles, infrastructures, etc., have attracted a lot of attention recently due to great potential to support intelligent transportation, various safety applications, and on-road infotainment. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of a recent research on enabling efficient and reliable vehicular communications from the network layer perspective. First, we introduce general applications and unique characteristics of vehicular communication networks and the corresponding classifications. Based on different driving patterns, we categorize vehicular networks into manual driving vehicular networks and automated driving vehicular networks, and then discuss the available communication techniques, network structures, routing protocols, and handoff strategies applied in these vehicular networks. Finally, we identify the challenges confronted by the current vehicular networks and present the corresponding research opportunities.

AB This paper deals with real-time optimal motion planning for astable AUVs, and presents an approximate analytical solution for the optimal control problem of a symmetric astable AUV with symmetric thruster configuration. The results show that the motion along the target vector is optimal for such underwater vehicles. The numerical solutions are found to be in good agreement with the approximate analytical solution. A relationship between the number of thrusters and the energy consumed is derived analytically for forward motion. The effect of the number of thrusters on optimality is shown to be significant at higher speeds. In the case of omni-directional underwater vehicles, the number of thrusters plays major role in optimal motion planning. For monostable underwater vehicles, the approximate analytical solution can be used as a good starting point for numerical solution. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID MOBILE ROBOTS
AB Modern autonomous vehicles are using more than one method for performing the positioning task. The most common positioning methods for indoor vehicles are odometry for relative positioning and triangulation for absolute positioning. In many cases a Kalman filter is required to merge the data from the positioning systems and determines the vehicle position based on error analysis of the measurements and calculation procedures. A Kalman filter is particularly advantageous for ''on-the-fly'' positioning, which is performed while the vehicle is ita motion. This paper presents the implementation of a Kalman filter in ''ROBI'' - an AGV for material handling in a manufacturing environment. The performance of the filter in estimating the position of the AGV and the effect of motion parameters (speed, path curvature, beacon layout etc.) on filter accuracy are shown.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle control has been a topic of research in the last decades. The challenges addressed vary depending on each research group's interests. In this paper, we focus on the predictive functional control (PFC), which is a control strategy that is easy to understand, install, tune, and optimize. PFC is being developed and applied in industrial applications, such as distillation, reactors, and furnaces. This paper presents the first application of the PFC in autonomous underwater vehicles, as well as the simulation results of PFC, fuzzy, and gain scheduling controllers. Through simulations and navigation tests at sea, which successfully validate the performance of PFC strategy in motion control of autonomous underwater vehicles, PFC performance is compared with other control techniques such as fuzzy and gain scheduling control. The experimental tests presented here offer effective results concerning control objectives in high and intermediate levels of control. In high-level point, stabilization and path following scenarios are proven. In the intermediate levels, the results show that position and speed behaviors are improved using the PFC controller, which offers the smoothest behavior. The simulation depicting predictive functional control was the most effective regarding constraints management and control rate change in the Guanay II underwater vehicle actuator. The industry has not embraced the development of control theories for industrial systems because of the high investment in experts required to implement each technique successfully. However, this paper on the functional predictive control strategy evidences its easy implementation in several applications, making it a viable option for the industry given the short time needed to learn, implement, and operate, decreasing impact on the business and increasing immediacy.

AB Semi-autonomous transportation systems are an intermediate step towards full automation of transportation systems. They use and benefit from the technological advances brought by automation while being already implementable at larger scale under the current regulations and within the existing urban environment.
   In this paper, we present a new type of semi-autonomous transportation system referred to as Multi-Layered Personal Transit System (MuLPeTS). It consists of convoys composed of one human-driven lead vehicle guiding several autonomous small capacity trailers in which the passengers travel. These trailers can detach from a convoy and travel autonomously in a protected environment before attaching later to another convoy. The interest of this transportation concept is threefold: (i) this assembly of vehicles is able and allowed to move in mixed-traffic conditions whereas fully autonomous driving is still largely restricted; (ii) a trailer can travel autonomously in the vicinity of stations to pick-up and drop-off passengers while the convoy it was previously part of continues its route without further delay; and (iii) passengers complete their entire journey on board a single trailer, that is they avoid the need to transfer. We analyze how this new type of transportation system relates to existing alternatives and propose an operational concept for it, in which we account for passenger assignment, lead vehicle routes and trailer movements, including empty trailer relocation. We extensively test this concept within a purpose-built simulation environment to evaluate the performance of this kind of system based on real-world data instances. The results highlight the most promising operational policies and characterize favorable system configurations.

AB To provide safety to users and not disturb traffic flow, autonomous vehicles in shared on-demand mobility services cannot stop everywhere; thus, pick-up and drop-off (PUDO) spots must be dedicated or established for them. Our research objective is to propose a method to locate the PUDO spots for shared autonomous vehicle-based mobility services as this topic has been barely studied. The number of required PUDO spots is calculated, and the location is chosen considering the urban environment, walking radius, vehicle occupancy, and time for boarding and alighting among other parameters. Different from some methods applied to shared mobility, we consider the existing infrastructure (e.g., parking spaces) as potential locations for PUDO spots. The method is applied to a study case, demonstrating the applicability and providing the main findings: (i) the required number of PUDO spots decreases if willingness to walk increases; (ii) with a 3-min walking radius, 83% of curbside parking spaces can be repurposed, and 100% is reached with a 10-min walking radius; (iii) the minimum of 55% of curbside parking spaces can be repurposed with 10-min walking radius and without locating PUDO spots in private parking. Using our method, cities can determine the quantity of PUDO spots and their locations, being prepared in advance for the required changes in the existing infrastructure as well as the freed-up space to be repurposed.

AB The objective of this study was to develop a heterogeneous traffic-flow model to study the possible impact of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) on the traffic flow. Based on a recently proposed two-state safe-speed model (TSM), a two-lane cellular automaton (CA) model was developed, wherein both the CAVs and conventional vehicles were incorporated in the heterogeneous traffic flow. In particular, operation rules for CAVs are established considering the new characteristics of this emerging technology, including autonomous driving through the adaptive cruise control and inter-vehicle connection via short-range communication. Simulations were conducted under various CAV-penetration rates in the heterogeneous flow. The impact of CAVs on the road capacity was numerically investigated. The simulation results indicate that the road capacity increases with an increase in the CAV-penetration rate within the heterogeneous flow. Up to a CAV-penetration rate of 30%, the road capacity increases gradually; the effect of the difference in the CAV capability on the growth rate is insignificant. When the CAV-penetration rate exceeds 30%, the growth rate is largely decided by the capability of the CAV. The greater the capability, the higher the road-capacity growth rate. The relationship between the CAV-penetration rate and the road capacity is numerically analyzed, providing some insights into the possible impact of the CAVs on traffic systems.

AB In this article, we present a digital platform for unmanned traffic management, UTM City, for research on visualization, simulation, and management of autonomous urban vehicle traffic. Such vehicles orient themselves automatically and provide services ranging from transport to remote presence and surveillance, and new regulations and standards for authorization and monitoring are currently being developed to accommodate for such services. Our system has been developed in close collaboration with domain experts that have contributed with scenarios and participated in numerous workshops to explore the use of visualization in airborne drone traffic monitoring, management, and development of the air space. We share here our experiences with this system and explore the need for visualization in future scenarios to ensure safe, free, and efficient air spaces.

ID VISION; SITES
AB Emergency landing is a critical safety feature for the expected increase of autonomous vehicles in the airspace. This paper presents Safe2Ditch, an autonomous crash management system for landing small unmanned aerial vehicles in populated environments. Using a prepopulated database, the highest-rated landing site is selected. As the vehicle progresses toward the selected landing site, a camera is used to image the area around the landing site. Using a recently developed visual multiple target tracker, moving ground obstacles are tracked and geolocated using a flat Earth model. These inertial target estimates are used to revise the landing site and allow the vehicle to land quickly in the presence of non-cooperative obstacles. The complete system is demonstrated through 2000 Monte Carlo simulations and 16 hardware flight tests.

An observer is designed to estimate both the sideslip angle and the vehicle yaw rate, based on which an observer-based controller is established such that the closed-loop system is stable and the vehicle follows a desired path accurately. In particular, the nonlinear vehicle dynamics model is reformulated as a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) system, and a finite frequency H-infinity criteria is satisfied such that the disturbances are attenuated effectively, the parameter-dependent gain matrices are calculated simultaneously by solving a convex optimization problem. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the method proposed. (C) 2021 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The AUTOPIA program has been working on the development of intelligent autonomous vehicles for the last 10 years. Its latest advances have focused on the development of cooperative manoeuvres based on communications involving several vehicles. However, so far, these manoeuvres have been tested only on private tracks that emulate urban environments. The first experiments with autonomous vehicles on real highways, in the framework of the grand cooperative driving challenge (GCDC) where several vehicles had to cooperate in order to perform cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC), are described. In this context, the main challenge was to translate, through fuzzy controllers, human driver experience to these scenarios. This communication describes the experiences deriving from this competition, specifically that concerning the controller and the system implemented in a Citroen C3. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this article, a self-driving vehicle controller that optimizes the path a vehicle follows from its initial position to its destination is presented. The methods include clustering-based k-means, hierarchical, Gaussian matrix model, and self-organizing mapping. The real-time parallel implementation of the unsupervised machine learning algorithms could provide fast response times of under one microsecond during the lateral, longitudinal, and angular motion control of the autonomous vehicle. It was observed that a random selection of one of the machine learning methods may not always guarantee the optimality of the position and velocity variables as compared to the desired values. The proposed parallel implementation and optimization of the algorithms could have a significant contribution towards making transportation mobility more reliable and sustainable for future vehicular systems.

AB We consider the problem of predicting the motion of vehicles in the surrounding of an autonomous car, for improved motion planning in lane-based driving scenarios without inter-vehicle communication. First, we address the problem of single-vehicle estimation by designing a filtering scheme based on an Interacting Multiple Model Kalman Filter equipped with novel intention-based models. Second, we augment the proposed scheme with an optimization-based projection that enables the generation of non-colliding predictions. We then extend the approach to the problem of simultaneously estimating multiple vehicles by using a hierarchical approach based on a priority list. The priority list is dynamically adapted in real-time according to a proposed sorting algorithm. Finally, we evaluate the proposed scheme in simulations using real-life vehicle data from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset.

AB This paper addresses the problem of enabling a group of autonomous vehicles to effectively patrol an environment significantly larger than their communication and sensing radii. The environment is divided into smaller areas and special coordinator vehicles are designated to control the transfer of the other vehicles from one area to another. Our past work showed that by organizing the areas and coordinators into a ring topology, we could design a control algorithm that globally balanced the number of vehicles in all areas within a bounded length of time. This paper extends those results to a much broader class of area-coordinator topologies and this added flexibility can be used in implementation to reduce the time it takes to attain the globally balanced state.

AB Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) services utilize idle electric vehicle (EV) batteries as distributed energy storage units for the power grid to stabilize the fluctuating demand. The commercial implementation and deployment of V2G services are hindered by concerns about battery degradation, inconvenience, distrust, and further range anxiety, making private mainstream EV owners reluctant to participate in V2G program offered by utilities. The centralized operation and fleet-level ownership of shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEV) can alleviate these barriers. This paper examines the economic and environmental co-benefits of V2G services in SAEV fleets, using results from operational simulations in a mid-size city (Ann Arbor, MI). We present a life-cycle assessment framework by considering SAEV fleets with 100-mile short-range (SAEV100) and 250-mile long-range (SAEV250) powertrain vehicles and compare the trade-offs of higher vehicle-mile-traveled (VMT) and additional infrastructure requiem nets in the electrified fleet with SAV counterpart. Incorporating a 30-year timeframe, we show that from an economic point of view, the operating cost of the SAEV fleet is 3.4%-8.4% higher than SAV fleet. However, providing V2G service can reduce the cost of SAEV250 fleet by 19.6% compared to SAV fleet by generating revenue, thus making it economically feasible to replace the SAV fleet. We find that on average, V2G service yields a revenue of $2,272 per vehicle annually while saving 66.5 tons of GHG emissions per vehicle per year. We also conduct a thorough sensitivity analysis to quantify the uncertainty of results from key parameters. Finally, we highlight the major opportunities for maximizing the environmental and economic performance of SAEV fleets under the provision of V2G services over the long term.

AB This paper addresses the problem of decentralized state estimation in fixed topology formations of vehicles with applications to Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). In the envisioned scenario, each vehicle in the formation estimates its own state relying only on locally available measurements and data communicated by neighboring agents, requiring lower computational and communication loads than centralized solutions. A method for designing local state observers featuring global error dynamics that converge globally asymptotically to zero is detailed, and an algorithm for improving its performance under stochastic disturbances and Gaussian uncertainties is presented. The proposed algorithm minimizes the H-2 norm of the global estimation error dynamics, expressed as an optimization problem subject to Bilinear Matrix Inequality (BMI) constraints. To assess the performance of the solution, realistic simulation results are presented and discussed for several formation topologies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Platooning strategy is an important part of autonomous driving technology. Due to the limited resource of autonomous vehicles in platoons, mobile-edge computing (MEC) is usually used to assist vehicles in platoons to obtain useful information, increasing its safety. Specifically, vehicles usually adopt the IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function (DCF) mechanism to transmit large amount of data to the base station (BS) through vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, where the useful information can be extracted by the edge server connected to the BS and then sent back to the vehicles to make correct decisions in time. However, vehicles may be moving on different lanes with different velocities, which incurs the unfair access due to the characteristics of platoons, i.e., vehicles on different lanes transmit different amount of data to the BS when they pass through the coverage of the BS, which also results in the different amount of useful information received by various vehicles. Moreover, age of information (AoI) is an important performance metric to measure the freshness of the data. Large average age of data implies not receiving the useful information in time. It is necessary to design an access scheme to jointly optimize the fairness and data freshness. In this article, we formulate a joint optimization problem in the MEC-assisted V2I networks and present a multiobjective optimization scheme to solve the problem through adjusting the minimum contention window under the IEEE 802.11 DCF mode according to the velocities of vehicles. The effectiveness of the scheme has been demonstrated by simulation.

TI Kinodynamic Motion Planning for Autonomous Vehicles
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED ROBOTIC SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE Path Planning; Moving Obstacle Avoidance; Autonomous Vehicles
AB This article proposes a computationally effective motion planning algorithm for autonomous ground vehicles operating in a semi-structured environment with a mission specified by waypoints, corridor widths and obstacles. The algorithm switches between two kinds of planners, (i) static planners and (ii) moving obstacle avoidance manoeuvre planners, depending on the mobility of any detected obstacles. While the first is broken down into a path planner and a controller, the second generates a sequence of controls without global path planning. Each subsystem is implemented as follows. The path planner produces an optimal piecewise linear path by applying a variant of cell decomposition and dynamic programming. The piecewise linear path is smoothed by Bzier curves such that the maximum curvatures of the curves are minimized. The controller calculates the highest allowable velocity profile along the path, consistent with the limits on both tangential and radial acceleration and the steering command for the vehicle to track the trajectory using a pure pursuit method. The moving obstacle avoidance manoeuvre produces a sequence of time-optimal local velocities, by minimizing the cost as determined by the safety of the current velocity against obstacles in the velocity obstacle paradigm and the deviation of the current velocity relative to the desired velocity, to satisfy the waypoint constraint. The algorithms are shown to be robust and computationally efficient, and to demonstrate a viable methodology for autonomous vehicle control in the presence of unknown obstacles.

AB This paper investigates the problem of path tracking control for autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs), where the input saturation, system nonlinearities and uncertainties are considered. Firstly, the nonlinear path tracking system is formulated as a linear parameter varying (LPV) model where the variation of vehicle velocity is taken into account. Secondly, considering the noise effects on the measurement of lateral offset and heading angle, an observer-based control strategy is proposed, and by analyzing the frequency domain characteristics of the derivative of desired heading angle, a finite frequency H-infinity index is proposed to attenuate the effects of the derivative of desired heading angle on path tracking error. Thirdly, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee robust H-infinity performance of the path tracking system, and the calculation of observer and controller gains is converted into solving a convex optimization problem. Finally, simulation examples verify the advantages of the control method proposed in this paper.

AB Underwater jacket structures or support legs of on-water platforms, such as ports and oil rigs, need to be periodically inspected for maintenance, environmental monitoring, and security reasons. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can potentially make these tasks more inexpensive and reliable compared to conventional methods that involve the use of divers and remotely operated vehicles. This paper proposes a robust and practical self-localization method for an underwater vehicle navigating around jacket structures, where the performance of conventional acoustic positioning suffers from multipath degradation. The key idea is to stochastically update the vehicle's horizontal position and heading relative to the structures using two types of perceptional sensors, sonar and camera, assuming that the configuration of the structure is known. The performance of the method was verified with tank experiments using a jacket mock-up and the AUV Tri-Dog 1.

AB In general, the dynamics of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are highly nonlinear and their hydrodynamic coefficients vary with different operating conditions. For this reason, high performance control system for an AUV usually should have the capacities of learning and adaptation to the time-varying dynamics of the vehicle. In this article, we present a robust adaptive nonlinear control scheme for an AUV, where a linearly parameterized neural network (LPNN) is introduced to approximate the uncertainties of the vehicle's dynamics, and the basis function vector of the network is constructed according to the vehicle's physical properties. The proposed control scheme can guarantee that all of the signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Numerical simulation studies are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB Tele-autonomous vehicles are often utilized for various remote sensing and surveillance applications, because of their capability to travel beyond line-of-sight, through dynamic environments. It involves extending Internet connectivity beyond standard devices, such as desktops, laptops, smartphones and tablets, to any range of traditionally dumb or non-internet-enabled physical devices and everyday objects. However, some of the existing model performed better only on a smooth topographical space and their response times depend on the Internet signal strength, thus making them unsuitable in rough space and/or low signal strength.
   In this work, we developed a tele-autonomous model vehicle to monitor a remote location, which can be controlled via Internet. It involves a high-performance drivetrain and an efficient servo-controlled steering mechanism, which make up the vehicles locomotory system. The vehicle is instrumented with four sonar sensors that measure the proximity of nearby obstacles within its vicinity, so that it can autonomously avoid these obstacles. To enhance the communication between an operator and the vehicle, a Human-Vehicle Interface (HVI) is developed using the TeraTerm Terminal Emulator (TTTE). To enhance the adoptability of the vehicle system for other applications besides remote video monitoring, three additional smart sensors; MQ2 gas sensor, a pyro-electric infrared (IR) sensor and a global Positioning System (GPS) sensor, were embedded in the vehicle system.
   Latency tests were performed in different topographical locations and cyber conditions to ascertain the response time of the vehicle as an Internet of Thing device. The accrued data were analyzed in order to ascertain the efficiency of the vehicle system in terms of Internet data communication and mechanical response. Results show that the developed vehicle is capable of prompt mechanical responses to control signals, and high efficiency in video streaming under different Internet signal strength.

The motivations for and potential advantages of autonomous or semi-autonomous systems are discussed. Examples are presented of the two general approaches taken; namely, guidance with respect to a directrix generated by the previous pass, or guidance with respect to a directrix generated by fixed points in the field. From this review, it is concluded that two recent technologies, specifically computer vision and the global positioning system, possess the technological features and characteristics most closely resembling those possessed by the human operator for implementation of a vehicle guidance system.

AB This article is concerned with a containment control issue for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), subject to unavailable velocity signals in cyber side and stochastic environment disturbances in physical side. We first divide the environmental disturbances into deterministic and stochastic parts. Based on this, a terminal sliding mode observer is developed to estimate the velocities of AUVs in finite time. With the estimated velocities, a distributed containment controller is designed for each AUV to follow a convex hull spanned by trajectories of the leader AUVs. For the developed velocity observer, a double power reaching law is employed to reduce the chattering and improve the convergence rate. Besides that, an adaptive strategy is incorporated into the containment controller, such that the steady-state errors caused by stochastic environment disturbances can be compensated. Stability conditions for the velocity observer and containment controller are also provided. Finally, we conduct the simulation and experimental studies to verify the effectiveness.

AB The paper addresses a problem of efficiently controlling an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), where its typical underactuated model is considered. Due to critical uncertainties and nonlinearities in the system caused by unavoidable external disturbances such as ocean currents when it operates, it is paramount to robustly maintain motions of the vehicle over time as expected. Therefore, it is proposed to employ the hierarchical sliding mode control technique to design the closed-loop control scheme for the device. However, exactly determining parameters of the AUV control system is impractical since its nonlinearities and external disturbances can vary those parameters over time. Thus, it is proposed to exploit neural networks to develop an adaptive learning mechanism that allows the system to learn its parameters adaptively. More importantly, stability of the AUV system controlled by the proposed approach is theoretically proved to be guaranteed by the use of the Lyapunov theory. Effectiveness of the proposed control scheme was verified by the experiments implemented in a synthetic environment, where the obtained results are highly promising.

AB Collision avoidance during vehicle lane-changing was studied using modeling simulation verification method to solve the problem of collision of vehicles on superhighways. The lateral acceleration model and the collision avoidance minimum safety spacing model were established based on the theoretical analysis of the quintic polynomial lane-changing trajectory model. Additionally, the simulated minimum safety spacing of collision avoidance was calculated using vehicle speed and lane-changing time. The simulation scene was divided into general and emergency lane-changing scenarios under the condition of limiting the maximum lateral acceleration, and the simulation scenarios were subdivided into seven simulation scenarios according to different lane-changing times and road widths for simulation verification. The results demonstrated that a longer lane-changing time was selected in the general lane-changing scenario, and the lateral acceleration and swing angle speed of the vehicle decrease with the increase of the lane-changing time. This ensured collision avoidance, stable vehicle driving, and comfort and safety of passengers. The minimum safety spacing and lane-changing time were short in the emergency lane-changing scenario, and the vehicle exhibited a mild skidding phenomenon during the lane-changing. However, rollover did not occur, which ensured collision avoidance. The distances between the vehicles after the lane avoidance simulation were 4.87, 5.06, 6.89, 6.49, 7.76, 4.21, and 5.52 m, respectively. It demonstrated that the seven lane-changing and avoidance simulation models involved in this paper had good effect on vehicle collision avoidance. The effectiveness and accuracy of the steering collision avoidance of autonomous vehicles on superhighways are verified using the simulation platform, which can effectively improve the safety of superhighway driving.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI The travel and environmental implications of shared autonomous vehicles,

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES

DT Article
AB Carsharing programs that operate as short-term vehicle rentals (often for one-way trips before ending the rental) like Car2Go and ZipCar have quickly expanded, with the number of US users doubling every 1-2 years over the past decade. Such programs seek to shift personal transportation choices from an owned asset to a service used on demand. The advent of autonomous or fully self-driving vehicles will address many current carsharing barriers, including users' travel to access available vehicles.
   This work describes the design of an agent-based model for shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) operations, the results of many case-study applications using this model, and the estimated environmental benefits of such settings, versus conventional vehicle ownership and use. The model operates by generating trips throughout a grid-based urban area, with each trip assigned an origin, destination and departure time, to mimic realistic travel profiles. A preliminary model run estimates the SAV fleet size required to reasonably service all trips, also using a variety of vehicle relocation strategies that seek to minimize future traveler wait times. Next, the model is run over one-hundred days, with driverless vehicles ferrying travelers from one destination to the next. During each 5-min interval, some unused SAVs relocate, attempting to shorten wait times for next-period travelers.
   Case studies vary trip generation rates, trip distribution patterns, network congestion levels, service area size, vehicle relocation strategies, and fleet size. Preliminary results indicate that each SAV can replace around eleven conventional vehicles, but adds up to 10% more travel distance than comparable non-SAV trips, resulting in overall beneficial emissions impacts, once fleet-efficiency changes and embodied versus in-use emissions are assessed.

The vehicle is the Typhoon-class AUV developed by the Department of Industrial Engineering of the University of Florence, Italy. The identification of the main hull hydrodynamic parameters is very important for the tuning of an accurate dynamic model of the vehicle, which could be used for several purposes including the development of model based localization and navigation filters. The authors describe the simplified identification procedure adopted for the Typhoon AUV starting from a reduced experimental dataset obtained during some missions at sea performed in 2014 in Biograd na Moru, Croatia.

AB A new locomotion method for unmanned (autonomous) ground vehicles (UGV) is proposed based around six independently driven wheels mounted on three separate modules. Each module is attached to the overall robot via a pivot point and capable of independently controlling its orientation and velocity. This configuration allows the UGV to perform maneuvers conventional vehicles cannot perform, and in particular to control the body orientation separately from the movement direction. The locomotion method is mathematically analyzed to develop appropriate control algorithms and to demonstrate the vehicle performance criteria. A vehicle was constructed according to the proposed configuration and experimentally tested in the UK Ministry Of Defense grand challenge. The performance of the developed locomotion schemes helped the robot make it to the finale of the competition.

DE Multiple AUV cooperation; Adaptive exploration; Control architecture
AB A recent concern in marine robotics is to consider the deployment of fleets of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). Multiple vehicles with heterogeneous capabilities have several advantages over a single vehicle system, and in particular the potential to accomplish tasks faster and better than a single vehicle. This paper addresses in this context the problem of underwater targets localization. A systematic and exhaustive coverage strategy is not efficient in terms of exploration time: it can be improved by making the AUVs share their information to cooperate, and optimize their motions according to the state of their knowledge on the target localization. We present techniques to build environment representations on the basis of which adaptive exploration strategies can be defined, and define an architecture that allows information sharing and cooperation between the AUVs. Simulations are carried out to evaluate the proposed architecture and the adaptive exploration strategies.

AB Cyber hierarchy and interactional network (CHAIN) concept control of autonomous plug-in hybrid electric vehicles is presented to fully release the potential of the vehicle components while guaranteeing the driving safety and stability, which was divided into cyber intelligent driving system (cyber-IDS) on the cyber-end and vehicle intelligent driving system (vehicle-IDS) on the vehicle-end. On the cyber-end, the state information of surrounding vehicles and infrastructures about traffic conditions are uploaded via vehicle-to-everything (V2X) and processed in the cloud to obtain future driving behavior via car following theory, achieving automatic following control. On the vehicle-end, the vehicle-IDS determines the set of its future control variables, and simultaneously provides an optimized control sequence in the prediction horizon by performing approx-imate global optimization instead of local optimization. The system global optimization needs the high coupling between the macro physical process(cyber-IDS) and the micro physical process(vehicle-IDS), and only the macro planning cannot be directly applied to the micro process control. The nonlinear system at the vehicle-end is decomposed into linear systems around each working point, and the dynamic characteristics between nodes are connected by neural network based on radial basis function of heterogeneous distribution coefficients. By introducing the genetic algorithm for time series, the CHAIN autonomous driving strategy capable of macro and micro coupling can realize the accurate optimal control under the actual driving conditions, which not only eliminates random fluctuations, but also enables a full-lifespan fuel saving of autonomous hybrid vehicles as well as no damage to battery health.

AB This article addresses the braking controls for an electric vehicle with DC motors such that the voltage in the motors is used for controlling the wheel angular velocity. Other papers on the anti-lock braking system (ABS) handled how to derive the braking torque (or braking pressure) for controlling the wheel angular velocity. However, heavy or prolonged braking can cause brake fade or wear. According to EURO 7 regulations, brake fade or wear is not desirable, since the regulations refer to the reduction in particles emitted from brake pads. For avoiding heavy or prolonged braking, this paper does not use a brake unit, such as electro-mechanical brake units or hydraulic brake units, for vehicle stop. Instead, the motor voltage is used for controlling the wheel angular velocity. While a vehicle moves, the goal of this paper is to provide automatic braking controls in real time, so that the vehicle stops safely and smoothly without slippage before colliding with an obstacle. In practice, road conditions can change depending on weather conditions, such as rain or snow. Moreover, road slope can have an effect on the braking distance for the vehicle. Thus, this article introduces automatic braking controls, while considering both road slope and road conditions. This article is unique in presenting automatic braking controls for the smooth stop of electric vehicles with DC motors, while considering both road slope and road conditions. In addition, this article is unique in controlling the motor voltage for controlling the wheel angular velocity, while not requiring any brake units.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Path tracking plays a crucial role in autonomous driving. In order to ensure the real-time performance of the controller and at the same time improve the stability and adaptability of the path tracking controller, a lateral path control strategy based on the improved LQR algorithm is proposed in this paper. To begin with, a discrete LQR controller with feedforward and feedback components is designed based on the error model of vehicle lateral dynamics constructed by the natural coordinate system. Then, a fuzzy control method is applied to adjust the weight coefficients of the LQR in real time according to the state of the vehicle. Furthermore, an update mechanism based on cosine similarity is designed to reduce the computational effort of the controller. The improved LQR controller is tested on a joint Simulink-Carsim simulation platform for a two-lane shift maneuver. The results show that the control algorithm improves tracking accuracy, steering stability and computational efficiency.

DE Autonomous parallel parking; trajectory planning; trajectory tracking
   control; B-spline curve
AB This paper proposes autonomous parallel parking for a front-wheel steering vehicle, with highlights on a trajectory planning method and on a trajectory tracking control method. The trajectory planning problem is decoupled into the path planning problem and the longitudinal velocity planning problem to reduce the difficulty of the trajectory planning problem. First, a collision-free path by combining circle arcs with straight line is created to park the vehicle in one or more maneuvers on the premise of meeting the kinematic constraint of vehicle, and then the path is transformed into a continuous-curvature path using B-spline curve. Second, the longitudinal velocity is created using B-spline curve on the premise of meeting the performance constraints of driving and braking system. To execute the generated trajectory, a non-time reference path tracking sliding mode control strategy is deduced by Lyapunov stability theory, and a longitudinal velocity tracking proportional-integral control strategy is proposed based on smooth handoff method. Finally, the parking performance is verified based on model-in-the-loop simulation system.

AB Autonomous emergency braking (AEB) systems are able to control vehicles as needed to avoid vehicle rear-end collisions. However, these systems are ineffective in scenarios with laterally cut-in vehicles and rapidly-changing dangerous scenes. This paper proposes a novel collision-free emergency braking system (CFEBS) that can enable intelligent connected vehicles (CAVs) to plan and execute a more conservative safety trajectory for the braking process in dangerous scenes by considering the longitudinal and lateral motion intentions of the surrounding vehicles. An intention identification model for surrounding vehicles is proposed based on long-short term memory (LSTM) networks and conditional random fields (CRFs). By considering the surrounding vehicles as risk sources and quantifying the risk with the speed of the risk flow, a potential risk flow model is built to calculate the potential risk map (PRM) around the ego vehicle. The global safest trajectory is generated via the PRM using the discrete method. The output trajectory profile is regarded as the reference for a model predictive controller (MPC). Simulation results show that the proposed CFEBS can predict vehicle intention with 91.6% accuracy and control the ego vehicle to perform effective collision-free braking operations in emergency traffic environments.(c) 2022 ISA.

ID MAGNETIC-ANOMALIES
AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently received attention in various research fields for their ability to perform measurements, surveillance, and operations in hazardous areas. Our application is volcano surveillance, in which we used an unmanned autonomous helicopter to conduct a dense low-altitude aeromagnetic survey over Tarumae Volcano, northern Japan.
   In autonomous flight, we demonstrated positioning control with an accuracy of similar to 10 m, which would be difficult for an ordinary crewed vehicle. In contrast to ground-based magnetic measurement, which is highly susceptible to local anomalies, the field gradient in the air with a terrain clearance of 100 to 300 m was fairly small at 1 nT/m. This result suggests that detection of temporal changes of an order of 10 nT may be feasible through a direct comparison of magnetic data between separate surveys by means of such a system, rather than that obtained by upward continuation to a common reduction surface. We assessed the temporal magnetic changes in the air, assuming the same remagnetising source within the volcano that was recently determined through ground surveys. We conclude that these expected temporal changes would reach a detection level in several years through a future survey in the air with the same autonomous vehicle.

AB The emerging connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technologies offer a promising solution to design better lane-changing maneuvers that can reduce the negative impacts of vehicle lane-changing behavior on traffic operations. Existing studies on this topic have predominantly focused on designing lane-changing maneuvers for a subject vehicle (SV) and typically assumed that a vehicle in the target lane must decelerate to make space for the SV due to safety considerations. Nevertheless, jointly designing the trajectories of the SV and surrounding vehicles and allowing possible accelerations of a preceding vehicle may further alleviate the negative impacts of CAV?s lane-changing maneuvers. To investigate this possibility, this paper proposes a dynamic cooperative lanechanging model for CAVs with possible accelerations of a preceding vehicle. This model collects information of the surrounding vehicles and updates the lane-changing decisions for the SV in real time via three steps, namely lane-changing decision making, cooperative trajectory planning, and trajectory tracking. This model applies a linearized vehicle kinematic model to make lane-changing decisions for the SV given the states of the SV and surrounding vehicles, the minimum safety distance, and requirements on the comfort level for passengers. Furthermore, it dynamically designs the longitudinal and lateral trajectories for the SV and surrounding vehicles. Extensive numerical simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Results show that the proposed model increases the success rate of the SV?s lane-changing maneuvers, smoothens the trajectories of the SV and vehicles in the upstream direction at the cost of a slightly more significant oscillation of the last vehicle in the downstream direction. Overall, the proposed model reduces the negative impacts of lane-changing maneuvers on the surrounding traffic. The results also reveal the robustness of the model performance by varying several key input parameters in the experiments.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) provide a useful means of collecting detailed oceano-graphic information. The hull resistance of an AUV is an important factor in determining the power requirements and range of the vehicle. This paper describes a procedure using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for determining the hull resistance of an AUV under development, for a given propeller rotation speed and within a given range of AUV velocities. The CFD analysis results reveal the distribution of the hydrodynamic values (velocity, pressure, etc.) around the AUV hull and its ducted propeller The paper then proceeds to present a methodology for optimizing the AUV profile in order to reduce the total resistance. This paper demonstrates that shape optimization of conceptual designs is possible using the commercial CFD package contained in Ansys (TM). The optimum design to minimize the drag force of the AUV was identified for a given object function and a set of constrained design parameters.

AB The Autonomous Vehicle Storage and Retrieval System (AVS/RS) with tier-to-tier vehicles is modeled as a semi-open queueing network (SOQN). Different storage/retrieval requests in the AVS/RS are modeled as different classes of customers in the SOQN model. Analyzing multiple configurations of an SOQN via computer simulation is time-consuming. Therefore, this article uses some analytical methods to evaluate the performances of a multi-class, multi-stage SOQN with general service time and interarrival time distributions. Two synchronization policies are also compared and the results show that an AVS/RS with virtual synchronization has a better performance than that with physical synchronization.

AB Numerous existing autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) formation control works have focused on the pre -configured communication topology. However, the complex marine environment reveals the limitations and unreliability of the fix topology scheme. In this paper, the formation control of AUVs is investigated under dy-namic switching topology. In order to realize this objective, the 2-D Delaunay triangulation and Jaccard index are introduced. A formation control system based on intermittent broadcast, rather than the traditional distributed control system, is established based on a leader-follower strategy. During the process of formation moving, the input constraints, vehicle collision avoidance and input saturation needed to be noted. To this end, the model predictive control algorithm is employed to design the formation controller, and the stability of the formation control system is proved by the average residence time notion and Lyapunov stability. The numerical simulations are exhibited to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed formation control schemes in connectivity preservation and formation generation.

AB With active research being conducted on maritime autonomous surface ships, it is becoming increasingly necessary to ensure the safety of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). In this context, a key task is to correct their paths to avoid obstacles. This paper proposes a reactive collision avoidance algorithm to ensure the safety of USVs against obstacles. A global map is represented using a Gaussian mixture model, formulated using the expectation-maximization algorithm. Motion primitives are used to predict collision events and modify the USV's trajectory. In addition, a controller for the target vessel is designed. Mapping is performed to demonstrate that the USV can implement the necessary avoidance maneuvers to prevent collisions with obstacles. The proposed method is validated by conducting collision avoidance simulations and autonomous navigation field tests with a small-scale autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) platform. Results indicate that the ASV can successfully avoid obstacles while following its trajectory.

AB This study aims to model drivers' speed in car-following during braking situations at intersections to estimate a safe comfortable human-like speed at the minimum car-following distance for autonomous vehicles (AV). Several car-following behavioral measures were extracted at different times before reaching the minimum following distance and the intersection control type (signalized or unsignalized) was recorded to train the model using three machine-learning techniques. The results showed that the XGBoost model is superior to other techniques with R-2 values of 0.99 and 0.97 for training and testing datasets, respectively. The results also indicated that the control type impacts driver speed at the minimum following distance. The modeled speed will provide a more comfortable experience for AV riders and will not violate the expectations of the surrounding traditional vehicle drivers. Also, the proposed model can be adopted to enhance current car-following models by considering the effect of intersections and their control type.

AB The latest developments regarding autonomous vehicles (AVs) have drawn the attention of tech-savvy individuals and marketers. AVs are expected to cause a major change in the markets of vehicle selling, transportation and logistics. Therefore, it is crucial to understand consumer acceptance so that the companies in these markets can develop their penetration strategies accordingly and technology companies can shape their technology development strategies. This study aims to examine individuals' adoption attitudes toward AVs by considering trust and sustainability concerns. This was achieved by expanding the technology acceptance model (TAM). A survey of 391 participants was conducted and the data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results confirmed previous technology acceptance models by showing the relationships between perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and behavioral intention. Moreover, the direct and indirect effects of trust on behavioral intention were also shown. This study provides evidence to extend the TAM to the adoption of AVs by uncovering individuals' sustainability concerns.

AB This paper proposes a cooperative scheduling mechanism for autonomous vehicles passing through an intersection, called TP-AIM. The main objective of this research is to ensure safe driving while minimizing delay in an intersection without traffic lights. Firstly, an intersection management system, used as an info-collecting-organizing center, assigns reasonable priorities for all present vehicles and hence plans their trajectories. Secondly, a window searching algorithm is performed to find an entering window, which can produce a collision-free trajectory with minimal delay, besides backup windows. Finally, vehicles can arrange their trajectory individually, by applying dynamic programming to compute velocity profile, in order to pass through intersection. MATLAB/Simulink and SUMO based simulations are established among three types of traffic mechanisms with different traffic flows. The results show that the proposed TP-AIM mechanism significantly reduces the average evacuation time and increases throughput by over 20%. Moreover, the paper investigates intersection delay, which can be reduced to less than 10% compared to classical light management systems. Both safety and efficiency can be guaranteed in our proposed mechanism.

AB Autonomous landing on the deck of an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is still a major challenge for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In this paper, a fiducial marker is located on the platform so as to facilitate the task since it is possible to retrieve its six-degrees of freedom relative-pose in an easy way. To compensate interruption in the marker's observations, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) estimates the current USV's position with reference to the last known position. Validation experiments have been performed in a simulated environment under various marine conditions. The results confirmed that the EKF provides estimates accurate enough to direct the UAV in proximity of the autonomous vessel such that the marker becomes visible again. Using only the odometry and the inertial measurements for the estimation, this method is found to be applicable even under adverse weather conditions in the absence of the global positioning system.

AB To ensure that autonomous vehicles satisfy the requirements of the traffic environment, vehicle driving ability, and desired driver experience during obstacle avoidance, this paper proposes a trajectory planner that considers three aspects: driving passability, regional safety, and driving acceptance. Multiresolution state lattices and Bezier curve fitters are applied to a state lattice framework to generate candidate obstacle avoidance trajectory clusters. Trajectory evaluation is then carried out in the above three aspects by using trajectory passability, safety and driver behavior proximity, and a trajectory evaluation function is designed to evaluate and screen trajectory clusters. The trajectory passability is checked by the vehicle motion capability set, which is established based on the vehicle dynamics model. The trajectory safety is evaluated by the potential field function between the fitted trajectory and the vehicle driving environment boundary with consideration of the inevitable collision state. The parameters of the vehicle motion state for the fitted trajectory are matched with the driving data of real drivers with different driving styles to evaluate the proximity between the trajectory and driver behavior. The rationality and effectiveness of different driving styles of trajectory planners are verified by vehicle tests under different vehicle velocities and different obstacle disturbances.

ID RESAMPLING METHODS
AB Before their massive deployment, autonomous vehicles need to prove in complex scenarios such that they can reach human driving proficiency while guaranteeing higher safety levels. One of the most important human traits to negotiating traffic is the ability to predict the future behavior of surrounding vehicles as a basis for agile and safe navigation. This capability is particularly challenging for an autonomous system in highly interactive driving situations, such as intersections or roundabouts. In this paper, a set of techniques to bring a computationally expensive state-of-the-art motion prediction algorithm to real-time execution are presented with the goal of meeting a standard motion-planning algorithm execution frequency of 5 Hz, which is the primary consumer of motion predictions. This is achieved by applying novel and existing parallelization algorithms that take advantage of graphic processing units (GPUs) through the compute unified device architecture (CUDA) programming language and managing to produce an average 5x speedup over raw C++ in the cases studied. The optimizations are then evaluated in public datasets and a real vehicle on a test track.

AB Existing environment modeling approaches and trajectory planning approaches for intelligent vehicles are difficult to adapt to multiple scenarios, as scenarios are diverse and changeable, which may lead to potential risks. This work proposes a cognitive spatial-time environment modeling approach for autonomous vehicles, which models a multi-scenario-adapted spatial-time environment model from a cognitive perspective and transforms the scenario-based trajectory planning problem into a unified spatial-time planning problem. The commonality of multiple typical Chinese road scenarios is analyzed, and a unified spatial-time environment model for multi-scenario adaptation is defined and established. The adaptability and trajectory planning potential of the spatial-time environment model are analyzed, and the planning results are obtained through a hybrid A* algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposal is effective in blurring the boundary between scenarios, allowing a single planning approach to adapt to multiple scenarios and plan optimal trajectories (optimal in both path and speed domains) and introducing more flexibility to the planning.

AB With the rapid development of offshore exploration, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have come in great diversities depending on their particular specifications in civil and military practices. We focus on AUV swarms in the shallow ocean for their potentialities in economic and military uses as well as in sci-entific investigations. Nowadays, the advanced technologies of perception, communication, and control in underwater environment give the AUV abilities to perform certain tasks in the shallow ocean. Still, many missions require the large-scale AUV swarms due to the complexities of the tasks and the uncer-tainties of the environment. In this paper, we start with the introduction of underwater technologies in AUVs. Then we induce the AUV swarms and present several key methods to form swarms and to keep collaboration. Finally, we propose some necessitates technological advances that can facilitate the appli-cation of the AUV swarms in the shallow ocean.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The field of aerial robotics is growing rapidly, along with the promise of assisting human operators with tasks that are hazardous, inaccessible, or time consuming [1]. Military and law enforcement organizations are especially interested in such capabilities due to the naturally hazardous nature of their missions, driving them to become early supporters and adopters. A particularly challenging mission is the exploration of unknown indoor environments, which has potential applications in exploring and clearing enemy compounds, searching for accident survivors, or responding to active shooters. Multirotor vehicles have been proposed and occasionally used in such scenarios, but as capabilities increase, so does the complexity of the hardware and software. As a result, researchers interested in exploring this field, as well as those in myriad other fields that depend on aerial experimentation, face an increasingly high barrier to entry: establishing flight capabilities. This article is intended to help aspiring researchers get their aerial robotics experiments off the ground.

AB In this paper, the impacts of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) on traffic efficiency and safety are numerically investigated. An on-ramp cellular automata (CA) model considering safe distance and interconnectivity is proposed and traffic flows under different CAV penetrations and distributions of CAVs are simulated. The outflow increases as the CAV penetration rate increases when the inflows are large, while the growth rate is insignificant when the inflows are small. The average speed distribution results also illustrate the positive impact of CAVs on traffic efficiency. In terms of traffic safety, the time-to-collision (TTC) results indicate that CAVs promote traffic safety in congested conditions. The criticality index function (CIF) results indicate that the mixed flow is still safe. We also proposed an evaluation index under emergency braking. Although CAVs have certain safety disturbance effects, they ensure that all vehicles are safe and alleviate stopand-go traffic.

AB This paper presents a distributed approach based on a Newton-type method for solving the fast formation problems of a group of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the plane. Each AUV of this group aims at minimising its own local alignment error function that formulates the difference between the desired relative formation of the AUV and its neighbours and their current positions. In addition, the group jointly minimises the total cost composed by local alignment error functions. The presented approach utilises a modified Jacobi algorithm based on local position data to approximate the Newton direction. It is shown that when combining the descent direction with distributed line search algorithms, the approach exhibits the performance of super-linear convergence within the neighbourhood of the desired position. Two numerical examples are considered here to illustrate that using the proposed approach, all AUVs rapidly achieve the desired formation from any initial configuration and initial position in both static and dynamic formation scenarios.

AB This paper provides a review of studies published in peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings, and technical academic and private sector reports on surveys about autonomous vehicles (AVs) from 2012 onward. The studies and respective surveys are categorized in this paper based on the study objectives and methodology applied. More than half of the reviewed studies on AVs focus on capturing individuals' behavioral characteristics and perceptions. The second most prevalent category includes studies about individuals' willingness to pay to use AVs. The reviewed studies were also categorized according to the study population. The paper identifies and classifies attitudinal questions in each survey into different components that may affect behavioral intention to ride in AVs and provides information on specific hypotheses that were set in the studies. Moreover, a discussion of the benefits, barriers/concerns, and opportunities related to the deployment of AVs is presented. The paper concludes by summarizing the lessons learned and outlining the research gaps.

ID UNDERWATER VEHICLE
AB Autonomous and Remotely Operated Vehicle (ARV) are widely used for underwater detection and typically require ARVs to track predefined trajectories. Manual operation is not very accurate and stable, and intelligent control methods are popularly devised. This paper firstly introduces the line of sight (LOS) method for desired heading guidance. Later, a cascaded model predictive control (MPC) is proposed. In the cascaded MPC, a quantum-behaved particle swarm optimisation algorithm based on a non-linear decreasing contraction-expansion coefficient (QPSO-CE-nonlinear) is applied to optimise the controller's output. Several validation and comparative simulations are carried out. The results show that the controller has advantages in accuracy, convergence, and stability. The LOS is applicable to holonomic ARV and accelerates convergence. The QPSO-CE-nonlinear algorithm can improve the rate of convergence when solving optimisation problems. In addition, compared with MPC-SMC (sliding mode control), the cascaded MPC is more robust.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have gained great attention, and individual expectations and perceptions influence attitudes toward them. Combined with the consumer satisfaction index, a latent congruence path model is established to study how the consistency or inconsistency of individual expectations and perceptions affects people's behavior intention. SmartPLS is used to calculate the difference value. Data collected from 877 respondents in China show that the more consistent the individual's expectations and perceptions are, the more likely it is to promote the use of AVs, but this effect has an upper limit. Enjoyment plays a key role in promoting AVs. In addition, utilitarian motivation can positively influence behavior intention through hedonic motivation. The findings provide insights into understanding how individual perceptions affect people's behavior toward using AVs and developing better travel services for AVs, and more importantly, how government agencies and vehicle designers can attract more people to use AVs.

AB Nowadays, industries have to deal with an increasingly competitive environment. In this sense, the operational process optimization to increase efficiency is crucial. The industrial systems are presently leaning toward every potential means of automation for improved accuracy and superior time management. There are significant challenges in industrial logistics management: streamline operations, customer service, transportation cost, planning, and risk management. Hence in this paper, the IoT-assisted Intelligent Logistics Transportation Management Framework has been proposed in the industrial environment to design an optimized logistics plan, improve customer service, and reduce transportation cost. This paper concentrates on identifying the optimal routes for the directed autonomous vehicle, considering different vehicles' necessities, renewable generations, logistic requests, and the essential transportation system. The experimental results have been performed, and the proposed method enhances the overall performance ratio of 97.8% and customer satisfaction ratio of 98.9% and reduces the cost function ratio of 15.2%, energy consumption ratio of 11.4%, and computation time of 0.19 s compared to other existing methods.

ID HIGHLY AUTOMATED VEHICLES; PERFORMANCE
AB Automated driving has many potential benefits, such as improving driving safety and reducing drivers' workload. However, from a human factors' perspective, one concern is that drivers become increasingly out of the control loop once they start to engage in non-driving-related tasks, which makes it difficult for the drivers to take over control in some situations. In the present study, we examined reviewers' comments of YouTube videos featuring takeover transitions on commercially available autonomous vehicles and categorized the comments into four topics: Non-driving related tasks, automation capability awareness, situation awareness, and warning effectiveness. Then we investigated people' opinions on the design of the takeover mechanism of commercially available autonomous vehicles using topic mining and sentiment analysis, and we found that 1) the topic of automation capability awareness received many more positive comments than both negative and neutral comments while the distributions of positive, negative, and neutral comments were fairly even in other topics and 2) people had extreme positive and negative opinions in non-driving related tasks than other topics. Finally, we discussed possible design recommendations in order to facilitate takeover transitions.

AB This study explores how to reduce the cost of prediction as much as possible while ensuring the prediction accuracy of a real-time crash risk model. The extreme gradient enhancement (XGBoost) algorithm was used to predict the crash risk of autonomous vehicles in different sections of highway. The results show that the prediction performance of the model is the best when the threshold value is 0.05. Choosing two variables to predict can ensure high accuracy and simultaneously reduce the cost of prediction when the accuracy of crash risk prediction of the three sections can reach 73%, 62%, and 70%. However, when only one variable can be selected due to sensor or system failure, the speed difference between the takeover car and the front car can be chosen to achieve the greatest benefit. These findings could provide a reference for technicians to design safer and more economical autonomous vehicles.

AB Reliable knowledge of the vehicle heading plays a significant role in the autonomous navigation of agricultural Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs), especially in the context of unstructured outdoor environments such as rural and forestry scenarios. However, achieving this information with an acceptable degree of confidence is a non-trivial task and still an open field of research. Expensive solutions are available on the market, but they often discourage most farmers due to the large investments needed for the startup. This paper introduces a novel algorithmic solution for reliable evaluation of the absolute vehicle heading, grounded on adaptive Kalman filtering with input evaluation via linear regression analysis. The proposed approach provides a functional and affordable solution to the heading estimation problem that can be used in real-world applications. The system is validated through an extensive experimental campaign using an all-terrain tracked rover operating in agricultural settings, showing good accuracy compared to other approaches, such as a dual GPS method found in the literature.

AB Low cost automation often requires accurate positioning. This happens whenever a vehicle or robotic manipulator is used to move materials, parts or minerals on the factory floor or outdoors. In last few years, such vehicles and devices are mostly autonomous. This paper presents the method of sensor fusion based on the Adaptive Fuzzy Kalman Filtering. This method has been applied to fuse position signals from the Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS) for the autonomous mobile vehicles. The presented method has been validated in 3-D environment and is of particular importance for guidance, navigation, and control of mobile, autonomous vehicles. The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the noise characteristic have been modified using the Fuzzy Logic Adaptive System and compared with the performance of regular EKE It has been demonstrated that the Fuzzy Adaptive Kalman Filter gives better results (more accurate) than the EKE The presented method is suitable for real-time control and is relatively inexpensive. Also, it applies to fusion process with sensors different than INS or GPS.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are increasingly being applied to highly detailed survey and inspection tasks over large ocean regions. These vehicles are required to have underwater hovering and low-speed cruising capabilities, and energy-saving property to enable long-range missions. To this end, a combined depth control strategy is proposed in which an on-off type variable ballast system (VBS) is adopted for satisfactory hovering or fast descending/ascending without propulsion to reach the designated cruising depth, whereas the bow and stern fins act as the actuator to maintain the cruising depth for more energy saving. A hierarchical architecture-based VBS controller, which comprises a ballast water mass planner and an on-off mass flowrate controller, is developed to assure good hovering performance of the on-off type VBS. Both numerical studies and basin tests are conducted on a middle-sized AUV to verify the feasibility and validity of this depth control strategy.

AB As the deployment of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) gains momentum, ensuring both security and accountability becomes paramount. This paper proposes a comprehensive approach to address these concerns. With the increasing importance of speaker identification, our first contribution lies in implementing a robust mechanism for identifying authorized users within AVs, enhancing security. To counter the threat of voice spoofing, an ensemble-based approach leveraging speaker verification techniques is presented, ensuring the authenticity of user commands. Furthermore, in scenarios of accidents involving AVs, the need for accurate accountability and liability allocation arises. To address this, we introduce a novel application of blockchain technology, enabling an event recording system that ensures transparent and tamper-proof records. The proposed system enhances AV security and establishes a framework for reliable accident investigation using speakers' records. In addition, this paper presents an innovative concept where vehicles act as impartial judges during accidents, utilizing location-based identification. Results show the viability of the proposed solution for accident investigation and analysis.

AB Sampling-based motion planning (SBMP) is a major algorithmic trajectory planning approach in autonomous driving given its high efficiency and outstanding performance in practice. However, driving safety still calls for further refinement of SBMP. In this article we organically integrate algorithmic motion planning with learning models to improve SBMP in highway traffic scenarios from the following two perspectives. First, given the number of points to be sampled, we develop a new model to sample "important" points for SBMP by predicting the intention of surrounding vehicles and learning the distribution of human drivers' trajectory. Second, we empirically study the relationship between the number of sample points and the environment, which is largely ignored in conventional SBMP. Then, we provide a guideline to select the appropriate number of points to be sampled under different scenarios to guarantee efficiency. The simulation experiments are conducted based on the vehicle trajectory dataset NGSIM. The results show that the proposed sampling strategy outperforms existing sampling strategies in terms of the computing time, traveling time, and smoothness of the trajectory.

ID PEDESTRIAN DETECTION; NETWORKS
AB With the evolution of communication networks, the Internet of Vehicles (IOV) continues to accelerate the safe and rapid development of autonomous vehicles. Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) communication is a key technology in autonomous vehicles and a potential solution to realize collaborative intelligence between vehicles and pedestrians. However, the existing V2P communication early warning system does not consider the uncertainty of pedestrian trajectory, and the determination of the collision area is limited to a single point, resulting in an inaccurate system judgment and limited improvement of traffic efficiency. This paper designs a new autonomous-oriented V2P communication network architecture and completes a V2P communication early warning system based on Long Range (LoRa). A V2P anticollision model is established, and a new V2P collision risk early warning method is proposed. In this method, danger index is introduced into the early warning of collision between pedestrian and vehicle. The long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial neural network is used to predict the pedestrian's trajectory, so as to deduce the pedestrian-vehicle collision risk area when the pedestrian trajectory is uncertain. Meanwhile, the confidence probability is used to judge whether the pedestrian and vehicle are warned. The simulation shows that the V2P collision risk warning method proposed in this paper has good performance, which can accurately warn the pedestrian and vehicle under different vehicle speeds and Global Positioning System (GPS) positioning errors. At the same time, it reflects the characteristics of intelligence brought by using LSTM methods. Using the V2P communication early warning system based on LoRa to verify the experimental results show that when the GPS positioning accuracy is submeter level, the prediction accuracy is greater than 98%. The results of the proposed method show good performance and high detection rate.

TI Safety challenges for autonomous vehicles in the absence of connectivity

ID INTERSECTIONS
AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are promoted as a technology that will create a future with effortless driving and virtually no traffic accidents. AV companies claim that, when fully developed, the technology will eliminate 94% of all accidents that are caused by human error. Indeed, these AVs will likely avoid the large number of crashes caused by impaired, distracted or reckless drivers. But there remains a significant proportion of crashes for which no driver is directly responsible. In particular, the absence of connectivity of an AV with its neighboring vehicles (V2V) and the infrastructure (I2V) leads to a lack of information that can induce such crashes. Since AV designs today do not require such connectivity, these crashes would persist in the future. Using prototypical examples motivated by the NHTSA pre-crash scenario typology, we show that fully autonomous vehicles cannot guarantee safety in the absence of connectivity. Combining theoretical models and empirical data, we also argue that such hazardous scenarios will occur with a significantly high probability. This suggests that incorporating connectivity is an essential step on the path towards safe AV technology.

AB This article considers the cooperative path-following control problem for a cluster of networked autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) suffering from unknown dynamics and ocean disturbances. By virtue of light-of-sight guidance and undirected graph, a synchronized guidance approach is created for underactuated AUVs, where multiple geometry curves are taken into account and information exchanges-related path variables are utilized, and thereby enabling AUVs to be synchronized and stabilized into a desired formation pattern. Within the distributed surge and yaw controller design, the unknown dynamics and the ocean disturbances are lumped together by using a linear state transformation. And a prediction-based fuzzy state observer (PFSO) is devised for estimating the unmeasured lumped states, where prediction errors are used to update fuzzy weights. Through the Lyapunov analysis, it is proven that surge and yaw-tracking errors and state observation errors are uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation verifications are deployed to illustrate the efficacy and superiority of the designed method.

AB The early stages of design and simulation of a new concept, autonomous underwater vehicle equipped with vectored thrusters is investigated. The opportunity to increase the research effort in innovative solutions for AUV propulsion and guidance systems is related to the state-of the-art analysis. The dynamics of submersibles is briefly recalled, to justify the choice to equip the vehicle with a three degrees of freedom mechanism capable to orient both the propeller and the stabilising tail-fins. The vehicle presented has to be considered as a "concept submersible", that needs further improvements and tuning to become a completely running test-bench for navigation system assessment. A tailored simulation package and results are also described, in order to perform a wide ranging numerical test campaign to foresee life cycle behaviour.

AB In recent years, great efforts have been made to develop unmanned navigation systems for Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs), while further improvements are still required for ASVs operating around obstacles. In this circumstance, this paper presents an Obstacle Collision Avoidance Guidance (OCAG) using obstacle detection with a two-dimensional (2D) LiDAR sensor. After verifying the algorithm of the OCAG in a numerical manoeuvring simulation, the OCAS was embedded in a physical model of a Catamaran-type ASV with a 2D LiDAR sensor. When the ASV sails along with a predefined global path, the LiDAR sensor detects the obstacles, the collision-avoidance actions are determined based on multiple factors including the motion and orientation information of the vehicle, the measured distance and direction information of the obstacles, as well as the types of the obstacles. The proposed OCAG showed good collision-avoidance performances with different obstacle types along the path.

AB This work aimed to develop an autonomous system for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to land on moving platforms such as an automobile or a marine vessel, providing a promising solution for a long-endurance flight operation, a large mission coverage range, and a convenient recharging ground station. Unlike most state-of-the-art UAV landing frameworks that rely on UAV onboard computers and sensors, the proposed system fully depends on the computation unit situated on the ground vehicle/marine vessel to serve as a landing guidance system. Such a novel configuration can therefore lighten the burden of the UAV, and the computation power of the ground vehicle/marine vessel can be enhanced. In particular, we exploit a sensor fusion-based algorithm for the guidance system to perform UAV localization, whilst a control method based upon trajectory optimization is integrated. Indoor and outdoor experiments are conducted, and the results show that precise autonomous landing on a 43 cm x 43 cm platform can be performed.

AB The emergence of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is expected to revolutionize road transportation in the near future. Although large-scale numerical simulations and small-scale experiments have shown promising results, a comprehensive theoretical understanding to smooth traffic flow via AVs is lacking. In this article, from a control-theoretic perspective, we establish analytical results on the controllability, stabilizability, and reachability of a mixed traffic system consisting of human-driven vehicles and AVs in a ring road. We show that the mixed traffic system is not completely controllable, but is stabilizable, indicating that AVs can not only suppress unstable traffic waves but also guide the traffic flow to a higher speed. Accordingly, we establish the maximum traffic speed achievable via controlling AVs. Numerical results show that the traffic speed can be increased by over 6% when there are only 5% AVs. We also design an optimal control strategy for AVs to actively dampen undesirable perturbations. These theoretical findings validate the high potential of AVs to smooth traffic flow.

AB Insects are capable of robust visual navigation in complex environments using efficient information extraction and processing approaches. This paper presents an implementation of insect inspired visual navigation that uses spatial decompositions of the instantaneous optic flow to extract local proximity information. The approach is demonstrated in a corridor environment on an autonomous quadrotor micro-air-vehicle (MAV) where all the sensing and processing, including altitude, attitude, and outer loop control is performed on-board. The resulting methodology has the advantages of computation speed and simplicity, hence are consistent with the stringent size, weight, and power requirements of MAVs.

AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology is considered to be the future of transportation and has gained much focus from academia, vehicle industries, transportation agencies, and the general public. To contribute to the existing literature, this study used three surveys carried out by the Puget Sound Regional Travel Study in 2015, 2017, and 2019 to identify the segments of the population based on AV adoption interest, the characteristics of such population segments, and the dynamics of AV adoption interest over time. Using k-means clustering, three distinct levels of AV adopters in the increasing order of adoption interest were found: (1) skeptics, (2) indifferents, and (3) enthusiasts. Multinomial logit models of the clusters identified sociodemographic, household, residential, and travel-related attributes as significant predictors of the level of AV adopters. The AV adoption interest was found to increase gradually over time despite the increase of public AV concerns. Ways to increase AV adoption interest were discussed based on the study results.

AB This paper proposed an optimization problem that determines the deployment pattern of dedicated lanes to connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) considering the stochastic traffic demand and the stochastic traffic capacity. The difference between CAVs and regular human-piloted vehicles (RHVs) is driving behavior. The driving behavior of CAVs is expected to be more standardized than that of RHVs. Therefore, we assume that when the penetration ratio of CAVs increases in the lane flow, the mean lane capacity will increase, and the lane capacity variance will decrease. The mean and the variance of lane travel time decrease when the penetration ratio increases. Following this assumption, the difference in the stochastic properties between CAVs and RHVs is considered in a traffic assignment model. The traffic assignment model is formulated as a variational inequality problem. The network design problem with equilibrium constraints was solved by a simulated annealing algorithm in a test network.

AB This article theorises interactions between drivers, cars and their surroundings. It uses Don Ihde's four human-technology relations - embodiment, hermeneutic, alterity and background - to analyse the ways in which human-car relationships develop through the process of driving. When driving non-autonomous cars, humans are engaged with cars in driver-car assemblages, within which they are aware of not only the car and how they control its movement but also the road and environmental conditions conveyed through the car. In autonomous and semi-autonomous cars, the connection between driver and car, process of driving and surrounding environment is disrupted. This may be regarded as a positive change, freeing drivers from the work of driving to enjoy rest and entertainment as they become passengers; however, as the car moves into a background relation with people inside the vehicle, it can become difficult for a human to take back control of the driving process with little warning.

AB Long Range Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (LRAUVs) offer the potential to monitor the ocean at higher spatial and temporal resolutions compared to conventional ship-based techniques. The multi-week to multi -month endurance of LRAUVs enables them to operate independently of a support vessel, creating novel opportunities for ocean observation. The National Oceanography Centre's Autosub Long Range is one of a small number of vehicles designed for a multi-month endurance. The latest iteration, Autosub Long Range 1500 (ALR1500), is a 1500 m depth-rated LRAUV developed for ocean science in coastal and shelf seas or in the epipelagic and meteorologic regions of the ocean. This paper presents the design of the ALR1500 and results from a five week continuous deployment from Plymouth, UK, to the continental shelf break and back again, a distance of approximately 2000km which consumed half of the installed energy. The LRAUV was unaccompanied throughout the mission and operated continuously beyond visual line of sight.

AB The predictive uncertainty of ocean currents needs to be considered in the path planning of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) in oceanic environments. An interval optimization (IO) scheme is presented in this paper to plan time-optimal paths for AUVs operating in oceanic environments with dynamic and uncertain flow fields; interval currents are established to process the uncertainty of forecasted ocean flows, and the IO scheme is used to search for time-optimal paths in the interval current fields. The IO scheme is a two-layer framework: In the outer layer, quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization is used to generate and optimize candidate paths. In the inner layer, the interval response of the candidate path from the outer layer is calculated under interval current fields, and they are converted into a time-optimal fitness value in accordance with the possibility degree of interval numbers. The influence of predictive uncertainty is analyzed via simulation, and the robustness of the IO scheme is verified.

ID AVOIDANCE
AB The article considers the problem of autonomous control of the underwater remotely operated vehicle mini Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) in a collision situation with a stationary obstacle. The control of the collision avoidance process is presented as a synthesis of fuzzy proportional-differential controllers for the control of distance and orientation concerning the detected stationary obstacle. The control of the submergence depth of the underwater vehicle has been adopted as a separate control flow. A method to obtain the main motion parameters of the underwater vehicle relative to the detected stationary obstacle using a Laser-based Vision System (LVS) and a pressure sensor coupled to an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is described and discussed. The result of computer implementation of the designed fuzzy controllers for collision avoidance is demonstrated in simulation tests and experiments carried out with the mini ROV in the test pool.

AB The problem of autonomous navigation of a ground vehicle in unstructured environments is both challenging and crucial for the deployment of this type of vehicle in real-world applications. Several well-established communities in robotics research deal with these scenarios such as search and rescue robotics, planetary exploration, and agricultural robotics. Perception plays a crucial role in this context, since it provides the necessary information to make the vehicle aware of its own status and its surrounding environment. We present a review on the recent contributions in the robotics literature adopting learning-based methods to solve the problem of environment perception and interpretation with the final aim of the autonomous context-aware navigation of ground vehicles in unstructured environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work providing such a review in this context.

AB In this article, we tackle the problem of path following control of an underactuated autonomous surface vehicle in the presence of external disturbances and model parametric uncertainty. Using the conventional Lyapunov-based backstepping technique, we derive a nonlinear control law to determine a vectored actuation composed of a thrust direction and a thrust force that is bounded with respect to the position error. The model's linear and angular hydrodynamic damping terms are assumed to be known with uncertainty, while the external disturbances are fully unknown. The errors stemming from both the model parametric uncertainty and the exogenous disturbances are compensated by a couple of bounded integral actions which, when embedded into the control law, help rendering the origin of the error system a global attractor. The proposed strategy is validated by a set of simulation results, with its efficacy and robustness further demonstrated through a set of experimental trials using a fully autonomous instrumented surface craft.

AB Tracking and observing underwater structures at close range are important for gathering high-resolution information. This article proposes a method to track omnidirectional surfaces using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). This method is suitable for surveying various kinds of underwater structures, such as rugged seafloors, ship hulls, pools, dams, and quay walls. It is based on stochastic means, and has two important features. First, it depends on only commercial off-the-shelf sensors (mechanical scanning imaging sonar, a water current sensor, and an attitude sensor). Second, it is applicable to fast moving vehicles. This method is implemented in the AUV highly agile terrain tracker for ocean research and investigation, and verification tests in the sea and in a tank are carried out to evaluate its performance. In the sea, the AUV succeeded in tracking the rugged seafloor at high speed. In the tank, the AUV succeeded in tracking vertical walls while keeping its roll angle at 90 degrees.

AB This paper presents an effective hybrid control approach for building stable wireless sensor networks between heterogeneous unmanned vehicles using long-endurance aerial robotic vehicles. For optimal deployment of the aerial vehicles in communication networks, a gradient climbing based self-estimating control algorithm is utilized to locate the aerial platforms to maintain maximum communication throughputs between distributed multiple nodes. The autonomous aerial robots, which function as communication relay nodes, extract and harvest thermal energy from the atmospheric environment to improve their flight endurance within specified communication coverage areas. The rapidly-deployable sensor networks with the high-endurance aerial vehicles can be used for various application areas including environment monitoring, surveillance, tracking, and decision-making support. Flight test and simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid control technique for robust communication networks.

AB This paper investigates the navigation problem of autonomous vehicles based on reinforcement learning (RL) with both stability and smoothness guarantees. By introducing a data-based Lyapunov function, the stability criterion in mean cost is obtained, where the Lyapunov function has a property of fast descending. Then, an off-policy RL algorithm is proposed to train safe policies, in which a more strict constraint is exerted in the framework of model-free RL to ensure the fast convergence of policy generation, in contrast with the existing RL merely with stability guarantee. In addition, by simultaneously introducing constraints on action increments and action distribution variations, the difference between the adjacent actions is effectively alleviated to ensure the smoothness of the obtained policy, instead of only seeking the similarity of the distributions of adjacent actions as commonly done in the past literature. A navigation task of a ground differentially driven mobile vehicle in simulations is adopted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm on the fast stability and smoothness.

AB Recent empirical studies indicated that using autonomous vehicles (AVs) can reduce commuters' value of time. In this context, this paper investigates how variation in value of time for AVs will reshape the commuting dynamics in the short-run and the implication on AV-related policies in the long run. We find that in the short run, the adoption of AV can create more congestion delays since delay becomes cheaper for commuters. In the long run, a number of external factors such as ownership cost and safety concerns may affect commuters' preference for AVs as against to traditional vehicles (TVs). This will influence the AV penetration, which in turn affects the daily commuting equilibrium. Multiple long-run equilibria with different AV penetrations may exist, depending on the additional cost/benefit of AVs with respect to TVs. Government subsidies may be needed to drive the system from inefficient long-run equilibrium to a more efficient one.

AB In this article, we present one solution to the multitask formation and moving objects interception problem of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) using the graph-based approach. The investigated problem includes three subtasks, i.e., to steer agents to a desired geometric pattern, to assign the ASVs for intercepting the moving attacker and forming a new formation, respectively, and to revert to original desired formation after successful interception. A switching strategy is designed to make the ASV switch between different modes. To deal with the nonlinear dynamics of ASV and improve the robustness against model uncertainties and external disturbances, the adaptive backstepping technique is incorporated. It is shown that the group of ASVs can accomplish all the tasks with different courses of attackers. The work offers a more flexible solution for the ASV group where malicious attacker exists. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by simulations.

AB This paper proposes an acceleration technique to minimise the unnecessary operations on a state-of-the-art machine learning model and thus to improve the processing speed while maintaining the accuracy. After the study of the main bottlenecks that negatively affect the performance of convolutional neural networks, this paper designs and implements a discarding technique for YOLOv3-based algorithms to increase the speed and maintain accuracy. After applying the discarding technique, YOLOv3 can achieve a 22% of improvement in terms of speed. Moreover, the results of this new discarding technique were tested on Tiny-YOLOv3 with three output layers on an autonomous vehicle for pedestrian detection and it achieved an improvement of 48.7% in speed. The dynamic discarding technique just needs one training process to create the model and thus execute the approach, which preserves accuracy. The improved detector based on the discarding technique is able to readily alert the operator of the autonomous vehicle to take the emergency brake of the vehicle in order to avoid collision and consequently save lives.

AB In this paper, we propose a survey of the Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) field when considering the recent evolution of autonomous driving. The growing interest regarding self-driving cars has given new directions to localization and mapping techniques. In this survey, we give an overview of the different branches of SLAM before going into the details of specific trends that are of interest when considered with autonomous applications in mind. We first present the limits of classical approaches for autonomous driving and discuss the criteria that are essential for this kind of application. We then review the methods where the identified challenges are tackled. We mostly focus on approaches building and reusing long-term maps in various conditions (weather, season, etc.). We also go through the emerging domain of multivehicle SLAM and its link with self-driving cars. We survey the different paradigms of that field (centralized and distributed) and the existing solutions. Finally, we conclude by giving an overview of the various large-scale experiments that have been carried out until now and discuss the remaining challenges and future orientations.

AB The recent development in autonomous driving involves high-level computer vision and detailed road scene understanding. Today, most autonomous vehicles employ expensive high quality sensor-set such as light detection and ranging (LIDAR) and HD maps with high level annotations. In this paper, we propose a scalable and affordable data collection and annotation framework, image-to-map annotation proximity (I2MAP), for affordance learning in autonomous driving applications. We provide a new driving dataset using our proposed framework for driving scene affordance learning by calibrating the data samples with available tags from online database such as open street map (OSM). Our benchmark consists of 40 000 images with more than 40 affordance labels under various day time and weather even with very challenging heavy snow. We implemented sample advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) functions by training our data with neural networks (NN) and cross-validate the results on benchmarks like KITTI and BDD100K, which indicate the effectiveness of our framework and training models.

AB Following man-made rules in the traditional control method of autonomous driving causes limitations for intelligent vehicles under various traffic conditions that need to be overcome by incorporating machine learning-based method. The latter is inherently suitable for simple tasks of autonomous driving according to its limited characteristic under complex multi-lane traffic conditions. In this paper, a decision control method is proposed based on multi-task reinforcement learning to address the shortcomings of autonomous driving control under complex traffic conditions. Herein, the autonomous driving task is divided into several subtasks utilizing the proposed method to reduce the training time and improve traffic efficiency under complex multi-lane traffic condition. To ensure the efficiency and robustness of agent convergence to the optimal action space, an adaptive noise exploration method is designed for the subtasks with convex characteristics. Five-lane driving tasks scenarios embedded in Carla simulator have been conducted to verify the proposed method. The results of the simulation draw the conclusion that the proposed method increases the driving efficiency of intelligent vehicles under complex traffic conditions.

AB The present study investigates the position tracking control of the underactuated autonomous surface vehicle, which is subjected to parameters uncertainties and external disturbances. In this regard, the backstepping method, neural network, dynamic surface control and the sliding mode method are employed to design an adaptive robust controller. Moreover, a Lyapunov synthesis is utilized to verify the stability of the closed-loop control system. Following innovations are highlighted in this study: (i) The derivatives of the virtual control signals are obtained through the dynamic surface control, which overcomes the computational complexities of the conventional backstepping method. (ii) The designed controller can be easily applied in practical applications with no requirement to employ the neural network and state predictors to obtain model parameters. (iii) The prediction errors are combined with position tracking errors to construct the neural network updating laws, which improves the adaptation and the tracking performance. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed position tracking controller.

AB In the context of autonomous driving and road situation awareness, this manuscript introduces a Bayesian network that enables the prediction of participant vehicles (PVs) circulating on a highway. The network architecture combines Long-Short-Term-Memory recurrent Deep networks and Support Vector Machines as computational nodes in a graph. The network inputs are real data acquired by radar and synthetic data generated mimicking the real ones. The interaction among multiple vehicles is handled explicitly by introducing the Allowance Factors that model the constraints of the possible interactions of the PVs and the ego car in the trajectory forecast estimation. Results obtained on the conducted tests show the ability of the system to predict the motion of the vehicles up to 6 s in advance with a 92% mean average accuracy. Additionally, if implemented into automatic trajectory planners, the introduced modeling approach enables the prediction and avoidance of possible vehicles' collisions.

AB This paper develops a novel linear programming formulation for autonomous intersection control (LPAIC) accounting for traffic dynamics within a connected vehicle environment. Firstly, a lane based bi-level optimization model is introduced to propagate traffic flows in the network, accounting for dynamic departure time, dynamic route choice, and autonomous intersection control in the context of system optimum network model. Then the bi-level optimization model is transformed to the linear programming formulation by relaxing the nonlinear constraints with a set of linear inequalities. One special feature of the LPAIC formulation is that the entries of the constraint matrix has only 1,0,1 values. Moreover, it is proved that the constraint matrix is totally unimodular, the optimal solution exists and contains only integer values. It is also shown that the traffic flows from different lanes pass through the conflict points of the intersection safely and there are no holding flows in the solution. Three numerical case studies are conducted to demonstrate the properties and effectiveness of the LPAIC formulation to solve autonomous intersection control. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study presents an integrated optimisation framework for locating depots in a Shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) system under demand uncertainty. A two-stage stochastic mixed integer programming (MIP) model is formulated to optimise the number and locations of depots in a SAV system, where demand uncertainty is represented by multiple scenarios with occurrence probability. The dynamics of vehicle movements are further considered by forming a trip chain for each AV. An enhanced Benders decomposition-based algorithm with multiple Pareto-optimal cuts via multiple solutions is developed to solve the proposed model. The proposed modelling framework and the solution algorithm are tested using two different sizes of transportation networks. Computational analysis demonstrates that the proposed algorithm can handle large instances within acceptable computational cost, and be more efficient than the MIP solver. Meanwhile, insights regarding the optimal deployment of depots in SAV systems are also delivered under different parametric and demand pattern settings.

AB The preview path tracking problem of autonomous electric vehicles with event-triggered transmission and bounded communication delays is addressed using polytope modelling and asynchronous gain-scheduled control methods. By finding a polytope with as few vertices as possible to wrap the curve composed of all time-varying parameters, a new polytope modelling method is proposed to describe the vehicle lateral dynamics, which can not only reduce the modelling complexity greatly but also keep the modelling accuracy. Based on the polytope system model, a network-based gain-scheduled controller that operates asynchronously with the polytope system is constructed, where the scheduling parameters are driven by transmitted longitudinal velocity. By computing the deviation bounds of scheduling parameters and utilising the deviation-bound-dependent method, an asynchronous gain-scheduled control design method is presented. The feasibility and advantages of the proposed methods are shown by numerical verification.

DE Connected and autonomous vehicles; string stability; generalized

AB Understanding the string stability of connected and autonomous (CA) vehicles is important for evaluating dynamics of regular-CA mixed vehicular flow. Although previous studies proposed CA car-following models and analysed the stability of the model itself, they do not focus on the stability of the regular-CA mixed flow. Additionally, stability analysis methods for traditional car-truck mixed flow cannot be directly applied into CA traffic systems, where the CA vehicle monitors multiple preceding vehicles in the platoon. This study presents a framework that analytically derives the generalized string stability criterion of regular-CA platoons. Moreover, an example is conducted to validate the availability of this analytical framework by using concrete car-following models. Simulation based approaches are also utilized for fully capturing car-following dynamics of vehicular flow. This contribution is helpful for guiding analytical investigation of string stability of regular-CA mixed vehicular flow, thereby giving suggestions for CA design for obtaining optimal stability situation.

AB The lack of autonomous aerial refueling capabilities is one of the greatest limitations of unmanned aerial vehicles. This paper discusses the vision-based estimation of the relative pose of a tanker and unmanned aerial vehicle, which is a key issue in autonomous aerial refueling. The main task of this paper is to study the relative pose estimation for a tanker and unmanned aerial vehicle in the phase of commencing refueling and during refueling. The employed algorithm includes the initialization of the orientation parameters and an orthogonal iteration algorithm to estimate the optimal solution of rotation matrix and translation vector. In simulation experiments, because of the small variation in the rotation angle in aerial refueling, the method in which the initial rotation matrix is the identity matrix is found to be the most stable and accurate among methods. Finally, the paper discusses the effects of the number and configuration of feature points on the accuracy of the estimation results when using this method.

ID MOBILE ROBOTS; ROBUST
AB This paper deals with steering and velocity control of outdoor autonomous vehicles. A fuzzy control system with two levels is used to track a path previously recorded or computed by means of a path planning program. In the first level a fuzzy logic system selects a goal point in the path to track taking into account the relative position and orientation of the vehicle, the curvature of the path ahead, and the vehicle's velocity. The second level generates the steering and velocity commands using the goal point provided by the first level and the current values of the vehicle's variables obtained by the sensors. The controller is computed by fuzzy identification using input and output data collected when a human is driving the vehicle. The determination of the number of fuzzy rules and the constant step-size is optimized to improve the convergence. The paper presents the application of the proposed method to the Romeo 3R outdoor mobile robot.

ID ATTRIBUTE-BASED ENCRYPTION
AB Automated vehicle applications are becoming more and more widespread, and the data security of the vehicle network involved is particularly important. Similar to traditional data, the characteristics of autonomous driving data security are mainly confidentiality, integrity, and availability. If data related to autonomous driving is stolen or tampered with, it will directly cause loss of property or life, which is more harmful than traditional data destruction. To address the security issues on the Internet of Vehicles, we propose an encryption (CP-ABE) scheme which is ciphertext policy attribute-based and lightweight. And it can provide fine-grained access control to data on the Internet of Vehicles with less computational overhead on the device itself, making it ideal for the Internet of Vehicles environment. The scheme also supports key traceability to address the user key leakage problem. Experiments show that the proposed system is effective.

AB Recently, many academic institutions and standardization organizations have conducted research on vehicular communications based on LTE or 5G. As the most important standardization organization of cellular systems, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has been developing the standard supporting vehicle-to-everything (V2X) services based on LTE, and has already prepared the roadmap toward 5G-based V2X services. With the emergence of new technologies and applications, such as connected autonomous vehicles, 5G-enabled vehicular networks face a variety of security and privacy challenges, which have not been fully investigated. In this article, we first present the infrastructure of 5G-enabled vehicular networks. Then the essential security and privacy aspects of V2X in LTE specified by 3GPP are introduced. After that, as a case study, we investigate the security and privacy issues of a 5G-enabled autonomous platoon, and propose several candidate solutions, including secure group setup with privacy preservation, distributed group key management, and cooperative message authentication. Finally, we discuss the security and privacy challenges in 5G-enabled vehicular networks.

AB Pilots use their senses and training to generate situational awareness (SA). They then use this SA to make sound aeronautical decisions. Autonomous vehicles, by contrast, cannot rely on pilot expertise in off-nominal situations. They must rely on their onboard sensors to build SA of the environment. As these sensors degrade, it is hypothesized that a point exists where the SA generated by these sensors is inadequate to allow the autonomous vehicle to make sound aeronautical decisions. In previous work, a point was defined based on broad assumptions within a modeling and simulation environment (i.e., the error within each sensor was known and not random). This research used a larger data set that contained random errors within the sensors. The data was then used to build predictive equations through a Monte Carlo simulation in the same simulation environment as previous work. While the data showed there was a statistically significant relationship between the error values in each sensor and the fused distance value, the resulting predictive equations were not able to provide adequate SA to make sound aeronautical decisions. This research highlights multiple issues the test and evaluation community will face when trying to develop new techniques for the verification and validation of autonomous systems.

AB Data-based research approaches to generate crash scenarios have mainly relied on conventional vehicle crashes and naturalistic driving data, and have not considered differences between the autonomous vehicle (AV) and conventional vehicle crashes. As the AV's presence on roadways continues to grow, its crash scenarios take on new importance for traffic safety. This study therefore obtained crash patterns using the United States Depart-ment of Transportation pre-crash scenario typology, and used statistical analysis to determine the differences between AV and conventional vehicle pre-crash scenarios. Analysis of 122 AV crashes and 2084 conventional vehicle crashes revealed 15 types of scenario for AVs and 26 for conventional vehicles. The two groups showed differences in type of scenario, and differed in the proportion of crashes when the scenario was the same. The most frequent AV pre-crash scenarios were rear-end collisions (52.46%) and lane change collisions (18.85%), with the proportion of AVs rear-ended by conventional vehicles occurring with a frequency 1.6 times that of conventional vehicles. An in-depth crash investigation was conducted of the characteristics and causes of four AV pre-crash scenarios, summarized from the perspectives of perception and path planning. The perception-reaction time (PRT) difference between AVs and human drivers, AV's inaccurate identification of the intention of other vehicles to change lanes, and AV's insufficient path planning combining time and space dimensions were found to be important causes for the AV crashes. By increasing understanding of the complex characteristics of AV pre-crash scenarios, this analysis will encourage cooperation with vehicle manufacturers and AV technology com-panies for further study of crash causation toward the goals of improved test scenario construction and opti-mization of the AV's automated driving system (ADS).

DE Autonomous vehicles; Mobility; Economy; Spain; NERTRA; GDP
AB Background Pollution, traffic accidents, and congestion are huge problems in most urban areas. Autonomous and electric vehicles are leading our society to a new mobility model, also known as the New Era of Transportation (NERTRA). Mobility is a strategic issue for any country, and this change of model will mean, in addition to a great technological revolution, an economic revolution. Methodology The purpose of this work is to carry out a study of the main economic sectors affected in Spain and evaluate the economic impact that autonomous vehicles will have on each one. Data from this sector have been collected, analyzing the economic and technological factors that will affect to a greater or lesser extent and made evolution forecasts. Results The study presents three different scenarios depending on how the transition progresses. The results are presented by each sector in each of these scenarios. These results have great value for the industry itself and the professionals affected, as well as for the authorities of the country to take the appropriate measures from the beginning of the transition. The sectors directly affected by this change represent more than 38% of the gross domestic product of Spain. Key factors, such as technological innovation in vehicles, and the emergence of new business and mobility models determine drastic changes in some important sectors. It is important to make quick decisions both from administrations and from the industry itself to adapt to new mobility.

AB Autonomous cars allow safe driving with a smaller headway than that required for normal human-driven cars, thereby potentially improving road capacity. To attain this capacity benefit, cooperation among autonomous cars is vital. However, the future market may have multiple car brands and the incentive for them to cooperate is unknown. This paper investigates the compe-tition and cooperation between multiple car brands that, may provide both autonomous and normal vehicles. We develop a two-stage game-theoretic model to investigate brands' strategic interactions and evaluate, from both policy and organizational perspectives, the implications of their cooperation incentives and pricing competition. We compare four market structures: duopoly competition, perfect competition, a public welfare-maximizing monopoly, and a private profit-maximizing monopoly. Various parameters are evaluated, including factors such as the capacity benefits from cooperation, cooperation cost and price elasticity. This evaluation provides policy insights into actions that could be considered by regulators and organizations for the operation of autonomous cars.

AB This paper addresses the trajectory tracking control problem of the autonomous underwater vehicle with tracking error constraints and prescribed time convergence. In view of the fact that underwater vehicle is inevitably influenced by unknown external disturbances and input saturation, a disturbance observer is first proposed to achieve prescribed time disturbance attenuation. By virtue of the proposed observer, the observation error will arrive and maintain at a user-defined compact set in a prescribed time, which lays the foundation for subsequent control design. Then, an auxiliary dynamic system with time varying gain is constructed to deal with the input saturation phenomenon. Finally, a robust tracking control scheme is derived by integrating the proposed observer and auxiliary dynamic system into the prescribed performance control architecture, which results in both prescribed time convergence and transient performance constraints in the presence of input saturation and disturbances. Numerical simulation studies are carried out to illustrate the superiority and benefits of the proposed algorithm.

AB Research into intelligent motion planning methods has been driven by the growing autonomy of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) in complex unknown environments. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms with actor-critic structures are optimal adaptive solutions that render online solutions for completely unknown systems. The present study proposes an adaptive motion planning and obstacle avoidance technique based on deep reinforcement learning for an AUV. The research employs a twin-delayed deep deterministic policy algorithm, which is suitable for Markov processes with continuous actions. Environmental observations are the vehicle's sensor navigation information. Motion planning is carried out without having any knowledge of the environment. A comprehensive reward function has been developed for control purposes. The proposed system is robust to the disturbances caused by ocean currents. The simulation results show that the motion planning system can precisely guide an AUV with six-degrees-of-freedom dynamics towards the target. In addition, the intelligent agent has appropriate generalization power.

DT Article
DE Autonomous vehicles; motion planning; particle filters
AB This paper describes a probabilistic method for real-time decision making and motion planning for autonomous vehicles. Our approach relies on the fact that driving on road networks implies a priori defined requirements that the motion planner should satisfy. Starting from an initial state of the vehicle, a map, the obstacles in the region of interest, and a goal region, we formulate the motion-planning problem as a nonlinear non-Gaussian estimation problem, which we solve using particle filtering. We assign probabilities to the generated trajectories according to their likelihood of obeying the driving requirements. Decision making and collision avoidance is naturally integrated in the approach. We develop a receding-horizon implementation and verify the method in simulated real road scenarios and in an experimental validation using a scaled mobile robot setup with car-like dynamics. The results show that the method generates dynamically feasible trajectories for a number of scenarios, such as collision avoidance, overtaking, and traffic-jam scenarios. In addition, the computation times and memory requirements indicate that the method is suitable for real-time implementation.

AB Considerable interest exists in modeling and forecasting the effects of autonomous vehicles on travel behavior and transportation network performance. In an autonomous vehicle (AV) future, individuals may privately own such vehicles, use mobility-on-demand services provided by transportation network companies that operate shared AV fleets, or adopt a combination of those two options. This paper presents a comprehensive model system of AV adoption and use. A generalized, heterogeneous data model system was estimated with data collected as part of the Puget Sound, Washington, Regional Travel Study. The results showed that lifestyle factors play an important role in shaping AV usage. Younger, urban residents who are more educated and technologically savvy are more likely to be early adopters of AV technologies than are older, suburban and rural individuals, a fact that favors a sharing-based service model over private ownership. Models such as the one presented in this paper can be used to predict the adoption of AV technologies, and such predictions will, in turn, help forecast the effects of AVs under alternative future scenarios.

The relative pose and velocity of the vehicle with respect to the quadrotor are estimated using a combination of data coming from a vision system, which recognizes a set of AprilTags located on the vehicle itself, and an ultrasonic sensor, to achieve further robustness during the final landing phase. The considered software and hardware architecture is provided, and the details about the landing procedure are presented. Software-in-the-loop tests were performed as a validation step for the proposed algorithms; to recreate realistic conditions, the movements of the landing platform have been replicated from data of a test in a real marine environment. In order to provide further proof of the reliability of the vision system, a video sequence from a manual landing of a quadrotor on the surface vehicle in a real marine environment has been processed, and the results are presented.

AB This paper investigates the predefined-time time-varying formation tracking problem of the networked autonomous surface vehicles with the external disturbance and without model information. For addressing such a complicated issue, a novel model-free integrated algorithm without velocity measurement is newly designed, which consists of the distributed predefined-time estimator algorithm, the predefined-time extended state observer, and the predefined-time local sliding mode controller. Specifically, the distributed predefined-time estimator is designed based on the time-regulator function such that each vehicle can obtain the virtual leader's information indirectly. The predefined-time extended state observer is utilized to observe the external disturbance, the unmodelled dynamics, and the velocity states through a new parameter design method. Further, the local predefined-time sliding mode controller is constructed based on the above algorithms to address the considered control problem in a velocity- and model-free manner. Finally, numerical simulations have been performed to verify the main results.

AB A new sensor-based homing integrated guidance and control law is presented to drive an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) toward a fixed target, in 3-D, using the information provided by an ultra-short baseline (USBL) positioning system. The guidance and control law is first derived at a kinematic level, expressed on the space of the time differences of arrival (TDOAs), as directly measured by the USBL sensor, and assuming the plane wave approximation. Afterwards, the control law is extended for the dynamics of an underactuated AUV resorting to backstepping techniques. The proposed Lyapunov-based control law yields almost global asymptotic stability (AGAS) in the absence of external disturbances and is further extended, keeping the same properties, to the case where known ocean currents affect the motion of the vehicle. Simulations are presented and discussed that illustrate the performance and behavior of the overall closed-loop system in the presence of realistic sensor measurements and actuator saturation.

AB This paper discusses designing and implementing an adaptive thrust distribution algorithm on the already robust control system for serial split-hull underwater vehicles to maximise operational efficiency. Split-hull underwater vehicles are gaining popularity in subsea operations due to their flexible hyper-redundant design and enhanced manoeuvrability. These features facilitate them to replace conventional solutions, including torpedo-shaped Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). The field of research is currently undergoing a considerable transition toward operations on subsea activities that are more economical and efficient. Thus, implementing a robust and energy-efficient control system is of utmost importance. The robust Super Twisting Algorithm (STA) based control system is used on the vehicle, and an adaptive thrust distribution algorithm is proposed and implemented to optimise the energy efficiency further. The work involves modelling the vehicle, fluid forces, torque effects, and thruster configuration matrix and implementing the adaptive weight distribution on the STA-based control system. With the help of simulations, the improvements in the control system are proved.

AB A major research topic in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) is the development of systems that will be capable of controlling the flow of vehicular traffic through crossroads, particularly in urban environments. This could significantly reduce traffic jams, since autonomous vehicles would be capable of calculating the optimal speed to maximize the number of cars driving through the intersection. We describe the use of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications to determine the position and speed of the vehicles in an environment around a crossroad. These data are used to estimate the intersection point, and a fuzzy controller then modifies the speed of the cars without right of way according to the speed of the car with right of way. Experimental tests conducted with two mass-produced cars on a real circuit at the facilities of the Instituto de Automatica Industrial, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Madrid, Spain, gave excellent results.

AB Many aerial robotic applications require the ability to land on moving platforms, such as delivery trucks and marine research boats. We present a method to autonomously land an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle on a moving vehicle. A visual servoing controller approaches the ground vehicle using velocity commands calculated directly in image space. The control laws generate velocity commands in all three dimensions, eliminating the need for a separate height controller. The method has shown the ability to approach and land on the moving deck in simulation, indoor and outdoor environments, and compared to the other available methods, it has provided the fastest landing approach. Unlike many existing methods for landing on fast-moving platforms, this method does not rely on additional external setups, such as RTK, motion capture system, ground station, offboard processing, or communication with the vehicle, and it requires only the minimal set of hardware and localization sensors. The videos and source codes are also provided.

AB The emergence of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) has the potential to dramatically increase road capacity, and the provision of dedicated lanes for CAVs is a common management strategy to ensure that CAVs take appropriate priority over other vehicles. However, existing models of CAV lane management do not perform well at low CAV market penetration rates. Therefore, a novel model is proposed to address this shortcoming in this paper, and qualified human-driven vehicles (HDVs) are allowed to enter the CAV priority lane when there is a low CAV penetration rate. A theoretical model is proposed to examine the impacts of three managed lane strategies under mixed traffic and then compare three lane management strategies under different CAV penetration rates and traffic demands. The results show that these lane management strategies can improve throughput, reduce travel time, increase speed, and reduce the variance of the distribution of vehicle speeds under different penetration rates and traffic demands.

AB With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), autonomous vehicles have been receiving more and more attention because they own many advantages compared with traditional vehicles. A robust and accurate vehicle localization system is critical to the safety and the efficiency of autonomous vehicles. The global positioning system (GPS) has been widely applied to the vehicle localization systems. However, the accuracy and the reliability of GPS have suffered in some scenarios. In this paper, we present a robust and accurate vehicle localization system consisting of a bistatic passive radar, in which the performance of localization is solely dependent on the accuracy of the proposed off-grid direction of arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm. Under the framework of sparse Bayesian learning (SBL), the source powers and the noise variance are estimated by a fast evidence maximization method, and the off-grid gap is effectively handled by an advanced grid refining strategy. Simulation results show that the proposed method exhibits better performance than the existing sparse signal representation-based algorithms, and performs well in the vehicle localization system.

AB This article addresses autonomous collision avoidance in restricted waterways in compliance with maritime navigation rules. Since waterways may have diverse shapes, it is not straightforward to design a generic approach that can be applied to all types of waterways. In this article, we propose a shape-invariant coordinate system and a systematic collision avoidance procedure that complies with maritime navigation rules. The waterway space is defined using the coordinates in the along-track and cross-track directions to efficiently represent various types of waterway shapes. An automatic collision avoidance algorithm is designed and applied to the transformed coordinate system, which additionally takes into account the compliance with maritime traffic rules in restricted waterways. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated in diverse types of waterways by performing Monte Carlo simulations, and the simulation results are presented and discussed.

AB Autonomous vehicles are expected to have a significant impact on the entire transport sector. With respect to public transportation, autonomous buses-as a means of small and flexible on-demand services-have the potential of increasing the accessibility of people and lower operational costs. As such services are not currently available, their acceptance by their prospective riders and their potential to boost public transportation are yet to be identified. The present study aims at shedding light on these issues by combining a Wizard-of-Oz experiment with a two-stage stated preference (SP) study. The participants of the study had the opportunity to try an ostensible autonomous bus, in the form of a feeder service, over a period of two to four weeks (Wizard-of-Oz experiment). Furthermore, they were confronted with the same hypothetical mode choice tasks, including two autonomous bus alternatives (SP experiment), before and after the Wizard-of-Oz experiment. The study took place in two cities in Germany, namely Berlin and Braunschweig. In this paper, we analyze the mode choices of the pooled sample of participants using a Mixed Logit model with random parameters in order to tackle respondents' heterogeneity of preferences. By estimating the model using the answers from the before and after experiments, we show that there is a positive effect in favor of the autonomous bus service for the feeder trip. In line with the expectations, the results indicate that the participants of the study have a preference for being the only passenger in the vehicle, while they prefer to call it just before their departure, rather than reserving it beforehand.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are emerging in the automobile industry with potential benefits to reduce traffic congestion, improve mobility and accessibility, as well as safety. According to the AV collision data managed by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), however, the safety issue of AVs has continuously been a concern. This paper aims to learn the contributing factors to AV crash severity from the latest 3-year AV collision data. To achieve the objective, we develop an AV crash severity classification tree with the possible contributing factors by the cost-sensitive classification and regression tree (CART) model, which can deal with the class imbalance issue raised from the AV collision dataset. Our results show that the main factors affecting AV crash severity level include manufacturer, facility type, movement preceding collision, collision type, light condition and year. These findings could provide useful insights for traffic engineers or AV manufacturers to raise effective counter measures or policies to mitigate AV crash severity.

AB We consider optimal control problems with ordinary differential equations that are coupled by shared, possibly nonconvex, constraints. For these problems, we use the generalized Nash equilibrium approach and provide a reformulation of normalized Nash equilibria as solutions to a single optimal control problem. By this reformulation, we are able to Prove existence, and in some settings, exploiting convexity properties, we also get a limited number or even uniqueness of the normalized Nash equilibria. Then, we use our approach to discuss traffic scenarios with several autonomous vehicles, whose dynamics is described through differential equations, and the avoidance of collisions couples the optimal control problems of the vehicles. For the solution to the discretized problems, we prove strong convergence of the states and weak convergence of the controls. Finally, using existing optimal control software, we show that the generalized Nash equilibrium approach leads to reasonable results for a crossing scenario with different vehicle models.

AB This paper presents a coordinated motion control scheme using a disturbance observer in task space for an autonomous underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS). Since, the UVMS is kinematically redundant in nature, the proposed controller permits self-motion which can be utilized to perform power efficient trajectory tracking and at the same time it also assures that the system is able to track the given desired spatial trajectory with minimal errors (despite the presence of external disturbances, system uncertainties and internal noises). The performance of the proposed coordinated motion control of the UVMS is demonstrated numerically by simulating a few underwater tasks such as payload conveyance. The system's disturbance compensation capabilities are shown and the effects of external disturbances and parameter uncertainties on the station keeping performance are also analyzed. A comparative analysis on power consumption is presented to prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We develop traffic management and data networking mechanisms and study their integrated design for an autonomous transportation system. The traffic management model involves a multi-lane multi segment highway. Ramp managers regulate admission of vehicles into the highway and their routing to designated lanes. Vehicles moving across each lane are organized into platoons. A Platoon Leader (PL) is elected in each platoon and is used to manage its members and their communications with the infrastructure and with vehicles in other platoons. We develop new methods that are employed to determine the structural formations of platoons and their mobility processes in each lane, aiming to maximize the realized flow rate under vehicular end-to-end delay constraints. We set a limit on the vehicular on-ramp queueing delay and on the (per unit distance) transit time incurred along the highway. We make use of the platoon formations to develop new Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) wireless networking cross-layer schemes that are used to disseminate messages among vehicles traveling within a specified neighborhood. For this purpose, we develop algorithms that configure a hierarchical networking architecture for the autonomous system. Certain platoon leaders are dynamically assigned to act as Backbone Nodes (BNs). The latter are interconnected by communications links to form a Backbone Network (Bnet). Each BN serves as an access point for its Access Network (Anet), which consists of its mobile clients. We study the delay-throughput performance behavior of the network system and determine the optimal setting of its parameters, assuming both TDMA and IEEE 802.11p oriented wireless channel sharing (MAC) schemes. Integrating these traffic management and data networking mechanisms, we demonstrate the performance tradeoffs available to the system designer and manager when aiming to synthesize an autonomous transportation system operation that achieves targeted vehicular flow rates and transit delays while also setting the data communications network system to meet targeted message throughput and delay objectives.

AB This paper is concerned with autonomous flight of UAVs and proposes a fuzzy logic based autonomous flight and landing system controller. Besides three fuzzy logic controllers which are developed for autonomous navigation for UAVs in a previous work as fuzzy logic based autonomous mission control blocks, three more fuzzy logic modules are developed under the main landing system for the control of the horizontal and the vertical positions of the aircraft against the runway under a TACAN (Tactical Air Navigation) approach. The performance of the fuzzy logic based controllers is evaluated using the standard configuration of MATLAB and the Aerosim Aeronautical Simulation Block Set which provides a complete set of tools for rapid development of 6 degree-of-freedom nonlinear generic manned/unmanned aerial vehicle models. Additionally, FlightGear Flight Simulator and GMS aircraft instruments are deployed in order to get visual outputs that aid the designer in evaluating the performance and the potential of the controllers. The simulated test flights on an Aerosonde indicate the capability of the approach in achieving the desired performance despite the simple design procedure.

AB Self-driving cars and autonomous driving research has been receiving considerable attention as major promising prospects in modern artificial intelligence applications. According to the evolution of advanced driver assistance system (ADAS), the design of self-driving vehicle and autonomous driving systems becomes complicated and safety-critical. In general, the intelligent system simultaneously and efficiently activates ADAS functions. Therefore, it is essential to consider reliable ADAS function coordination to control the driving system, safely. In order to deal with this issue, this paper proposes a randomized adversarial imitation learning (RAIL) algorithm. The RAIL is a novel derivative-free imitation learning method for autonomous driving with various ADAS functions coordination; and thus it imitates the operation of decision maker that controls autonomous driving with various ADAS functions. The proposed method is able to train the decision maker that deals with the LIDAR data and controls the autonomous driving in multi-lane complex highway environments. The simulation-based evaluation verifies that the proposed method achieves desired performance.

AB The last decade witnessed increasingly rapid progress in self-driving vehicle technology, mainly backed up by advances in the area of deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI). The objective of this paper is to survey the current state-of-the-art on deep learning technologies used in autonomous driving. We start by presenting AI-based self-driving architectures, convolutional and recurrent neural networks, as well as the deep reinforcement learning paradigm. These methodologies form a base for the surveyed driving scene perception, path planning, behavior arbitration, and motion control algorithms. We investigate both the modular perception-planning-action pipeline, where each module is built using deep learning methods, as well as End2End systems, which directly map sensory information to steering commands. Additionally, we tackle current challenges encountered in designing AI architectures for autonomous driving, such as their safety, training data sources, and computational hardware. The comparison presented in this survey helps gain insight into the strengths and limitations of deep learning and AI approaches for autonomous driving and assist with design choices.

AB This article discusses whether elastic and plastic impacts and scratches caused by applied forces (e.g., car bump, key scratch etc.) to a parked vehicle can be distinguished by an autonomous system. The authors assume that a force impact to a vehicle stimulates characteristic frequencies in the vehicle body shell components that can be used to distinguish the given damages. Eight piezoelectric film sensors made of polyvinylidene fluoride mounted at the inside of the vehicle body shell components doors, bumpers, bonnet, and tailgate are used as the sensing element. An experimental modal analysis of several vehicle components is performed to identify characteristic frequencies. The results are used to compute the best sensor position in order to detect all considered eigenfrequencies of the component. A constructed model set up for force generation was used to record reference data. Derived features of the reference signals are computed and assessed to their relevance of distinguishing the damages on the vehicle.

AB This paper presents a hierarchical motion planning approach based on discrete optimization method. Well-coupled longitudinal and lateral planning strategies with adaptability features are applied for better performance of on-road autonomous driving with avoidance of both static and moving obstacles. In the path planning level, the proposed method starts with a speed profile designing for the determination of longitudinal horizon, then a set of candidate paths will be constructed with lateral offsets shifting from the base reference. Cost functions considering driving comfort and energy consumption are applied to evaluate each candidate path and the optimal one will be selected as tracking reference afterwards. Re-determination of longitudinal horizon in terms of relative distance between ego vehicle and surrounding obstacles, together with update of speed profile, will be triggered for re-planning if candidate paths ahead fail the safety checking. In the path tracking level, a pure-pursuit-based tracking controller is implemented to obtain the corresponding control sequence and further smooth the trajectory of autonomous vehicle. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and indicate its better performance in extreme traffic scenarios compared to traditional discrete optimization methods, while balancing computational burden at the same time.

AB One of the most essential approaches to expanding the capabilities of autonomous systems is through collaborative operation. A separated lift and thrust vertical takeoff and landing mother unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a quadrotor child UAV are used in this study for an autonomous recovery mission in an aerial child-mother unmanned system. We investigate the model predictive control (MPC) trajectory generator and the nonlinear trajectory tracking controller to solve the landing trajectory planning and high-speed trajectory tracking control problems of the child UAV in autonomous recovery missions. On this basis, the estimation of the mother UAV movement state is introduced and the autonomous recovery control framework is formed. The suggested control system framework in this research is validated using software-in-the-loop simulation. The simulation results show that the framework can not only direct the child UAV to complete the autonomous recovery while the mother UAV is hovering but also keep the child UAV tracking the recovery platform at a speed of at least 11 m/s while also guiding the child UAV to a safe landing.

AB In the near future, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) will share road space with human-driven vehicles (HVs). In this mixed vehicular traffic, effective following cooperation among multiple vehicles is an important basis for improving traffic efficiency and safety. However, CAVs are unable to communicate with HVs to acquire information. Therefore, how to obtain HV information and realize cooperative car-following has become an urgent problem for CAVs. This paper proposes a CAV driving strategy that considers multiple preceding vehicles, including HVs. The strategy first uses a large amount of real car-following data to build an upgraded Elman neural network (ENN) model optimized with the sparrow search algorithm (SSA), which is utilized to obtain HV information. Then, we combine the SSA-ENN with the classical car-following model and use a time-varying weighting model to analyze the impact of the different states of multiple preceding cars at various moments on the host car, so as to achieve car following driving control. Numerical simulations are carried out, and the results show that the driving strategy can improve road capacity and suppress traffic oscillations. With the increase in CAV penetration, traffic efficiency, safety, and driving comfort are improved accordingly. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) are the next major evolution in urban mobility. This technology has attracted much interest of car manufacturers aiming at playing a role as transportation network companies (TNCs) and carsharing agencies in order to gain benefits per kilometer and per ride. It is predicted that the majority of future SAVs would most probably be electric. It is therefore important to understand how limited vehicle range and the configuration of charging infrastructure will affect the performance of shared autonomous electric vehicle (SAEV) services. In this study, we aim to explore the impacts of charging station placement, charging types (including normal and rapid charging, and battery swapping), and vehicle battery capacities on service efficiency. We perform an agent-based simulation of SAEVs across the Rouen Normandie metropolitan area in France. The simulation process features impact assessment by considering dynamic demand responsive to the network and traffic.
   Research results suggest that the performance of SAEVs is strongly correlated with the charging infrastructure. Importantly, faster charging infrastructure and placement of charging locations according to minimized distances between demand hubs and charging stations result in a higher performance. Further analysis indicates the importance of dispersing charging stations across the service area and its impacts on service effectiveness. The results also underline that SAEV battery capacity has to be selected carefully such that to avoid the overlaps between demand and charging peak times. Finally, the simulation results show that the performance indicators of SAEV service are significantly improved by providing battery swapping infrastructure.

AB The interactive motion planning between unmanned vehicles and pedestrians in urban road environments is the key to realizing the autonomous motion of unmanned vehicles in hybrid traffic scenarios. The problem of human-vehicle interaction motion planning modeling at complex intersections is studied for an unmanned vehicle in this article. First, the motion planning of pedestrians and the unmanned vehicles is established according to the social force model and the behavioral dynamics model. Then, the autonomous vehicle is added to the crowd, and the human-vehicle interaction force is established. The virtual force is added to the social force model and the behavioral dynamics model, respectively, and the improved social force model and the behavioral dynamics model are used for the motion planning of pedestrians and unmanned vehicles. In this way, the established model solves the problems of simple pedestrian interaction motion planning in the social force model and single-body motion planning in the behavioral dynamics and thus provides a strong support for multibody motion planning. Finally, through the interactive motion planning trajectory of pedestrians and unmanned vehicles in different scenes, the vehicle and pedestrian motion planning trajectory can effectively avoid overlapping or crossing, so as to avoid the collision, which verifies the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed model.

How to balance the tracking performance and the vehicle stability is a crucial and worthy research for the autonomous vehicle safety. In this paper, a hierarchical path control strategy consists of path planning and tracking with the consideration of vehicle lateral stability is proposed. In the adaptive preview distance block, the preview distance is adaptively regulated according to the vehicle speed, sideslip angle, and the preview trajectory curvature to balance the tracking error and stability. In the path planning block, the three-order polynomial fitting method is adopted to give the desired path according to the preview distance and the relative position relationship between vehicle and road or obstacles. The linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller is designed to tracking the desired path fully using the previewed curvatures and the vehicle motion error. The hardware in the loop (HIL) simulation and vehicle test results illustrate that the proposed strategy can deal with path tracking, avoidance and lance change scenes in low computation burden, and maintain the stability of vehicle simultaneously.

AB The emerging technology of autonomous vehicles has been widely recognized as a promising urban mobility solution in the future. This paper considers the integration of autonomous vehicles into bus transit systems and proposes a modeling framework to determine the optimal bus fleet size and its assignment onto multiple bus lines in a bus service network considering uncertain demand. The mixed-integer stochastic programming approach is applied to formulate the problem. We apply the sample average approximation (SAA) method to solve the formulated stochastic programming problem. To tackle the nonconvexity of the SAA problem, we first present a reformulation method that transforms the problem into a mixed-integer conic quadratic program (MICQP), which can be solved to its global optimal solution by using some existing solution methods. However, this MICQP based approach can only handle the small-size problems. For the cases with large problem size, we apply the approach of quadratic transform with linear alternating algorithm, which allows for efficient solution to large-scale instances with up to thousands of scenarios in a reasonable computational time. Numerical results demonstrate the benefits of introducing autonomous buses as they are flexible to be assigned across different bus service lines, especially when demand uncertainty is more significant. The introduction of autonomous buses would enable further reduction of the required fleets and total cost.
   The model formulation and solution methods proposed in this study can be used to provide bus transit operators with operational guidance on including autonomous buses into bus services, especially on the autonomous and conventional bus fleets composition and allocation.

AB While autonomous driving technology made significant progress in the last decade, road damage detection as a relevant challenge for ensuring safety and comfort is still under development. This paper addresses the lack of algorithms for detecting road damages that meet autonomous driving systems' requirements. We investigate the environmental perception systems' architecture and current algorithm designs for road damage detection. Based on the autonomous driving architecture, we develop an end-to-end concept that leverages data from low-cost pre-installed sensors for real-time road damage and damage severity detection as well as cloud-and crowd-based HD Feature Maps to share information across vehicles. In a design science research approach, we develop three artifacts in three iterations of expert workshops and design cycles: the end-to-end concept featuring road damages in the system architecture and two lightweight deep neural networks, one for detecting road damages and another for detecting their severity as the central components of the system. The research design draws on new self -labeled automotive-grade images from front-facing cameras in the vehicle and interdisciplinary literature regarding autonomous driving architecture and the design of deep neural networks. The road damage detection algorithm delivers cutting-edge performance while being lightweight compared to the winners of the IEEE Global Road Damage Detection Challenge 2020, which makes it applicable in autonomous vehicles. The road damage severity algorithm is a promising approach, delivering superior results compared to a baseline model. The end-to-end concept is developed and evaluated with experts of the autonomous driving application domain.

AB This paper addresses the leader tracking problem for a platoon of heterogeneous autonomous connected fully electric vehicles where the selection of the inter-vehicle distance between adjacent vehicles plays a crucial role in energy consumption reduction. In this framework, we focused on the design of a cooperative driving control strategy able to let electric vehicles move as a convoy while keeping a variable energy-oriented inter-vehicle distance between adjacent vehicles which, depending on the driving situation, was reduced as much as possible to guarantee air-drag reduction, energy saving and collision avoidance. To this aim, by exploiting a distance-dependent air drag coefficient formulation, we propose a novel distributed nonlinear model predictive control (DNMPC) where the cost function was designed to ensure leader tracking performances, as well as to optimise the inter-vehicle distance with the aim of reducing energy consumption. Extensive simulation analyses, involving a comparative analysis with respect to the classical constant time headway (CTH) spacing policy, were performed to confirm the capability of the DNMPC in guaranteeing energy saving.

AB Autonomous or highly automated road vehicles and all related technologies are under intensive research and development. Moreover, internationally a massive investment increase can be observed in the automotive industry. According to this megatrend, new automotive test tracks appear or older ones transform to be capable of testing and proving for autonomous vehicles. Therefore, the question emerges: what are the key areas for automated drive development, which must be financed in case of autonomous proving ground design? It is a real challenge to be able to make the right decisions due to a lack of numerous experiences in this field. In this research, experts of automated driving technology have been surveyed and their opinion and knowledge have been synthesized. As a strong purpose of gaining robust results, the conventional AHP has been amended by the Pareto approach to ensure that the derived weights correspond to the expert scoring intention so perfectly that it cannot be more improved. Since the non-Pareto optimal weight results might cause rank reversal in the final prioritization, the applied Pareto test guarantees that the final outcome reflects the expert evaluators' incentive. The conducted analysis has indicated that the obtained results are robust not only from the sensitivity point of view but also from the Pareto optimality approach. The proposed hierarchical decision model is therefore applicable to assist decision making for autonomous proving ground developments. The main contribution of the article, however, is to present the first reliable prioritization of the autonomous proving ground elements to extend the body of professional knowledge.

ID INCOME
AB As investments in autonomous vehicle (AV) technology continue to grow, agencies are beginning to consider how AVs will affect travel behavior within their jurisdictions and how to respond to this new mobility technology. Different autonomous futures could reduce, perpetuate, or exacerbate existing transportation inequities. This paper presents a regional travel demand model used to quantify how transportation outcomes may differ for disadvantaged populations in the Washington, D.C. area under a variety of future scenarios. Transportation performance measures examined included job accessibility, trip duration, trip distance, mode share, and vehicle miles traveled. The model evaluated changes in these indicators for disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged communities under scenarios when AVs were primarily single-occupancy or high-occupancy, and according to whether transit agencies responded to AVs by maintaining the status quo, removing low-performing routes, or applying AV technology to transit vehicles. Across the performance measures, the high-occupancy AV and enhanced transit scenarios provided an equity benefit, either mitigating an existing gap in outcomes between demographic groups or reducing the extent to which that gap was expanded.

AB Safety at high speed is the most important performance of autonomous vehicle. Wherein, yaw stability control (YSC) is a key technology to improve vehicle safety. However, the high-speed vehicles are easy to be out of control in nonlinear region, which will result in serious accidents. This study proposes a model predictive control (MPC) method based on the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model to realize YSC in the nonlinear region. Firstly, a T-S fuzzy model of vehicle is established based on a two-degree-of-freedom model to describe the vehicle dynamic characteristics in the nonlinear region. Then, a robust MPC is designed and its solution is given in the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) form. Next, a sliding mode controller (SMC) is proposed to prevent wheel lock in the YSC process. Finally, the proposed strategy is verified in simulations and experiments. The results show that the proposed strategy has similar performance in vehicle stable region with linear MPC, and shows the ability to suppress the instability of the vehicle in the nonlinear region, and its computation burden is acceptable.

ID NAVIGATION STRATEGIES; MOBILE ROBOTS
AB An experimental study is made on the alignment of three autonomous air-levitated vehicles with air-jet controls to achieve an equilateral-triangle formation. The vehicles are equipped with lasers, optical sensors, radio transceivers, and on-board power sources. The attitude and displacement of each vehicle are controlled by air-jets, simple rule-based controls activated by discrete optical sensors with binary outputs and special geometric configuration for formation alignment. The main objective is to determine the feasibility of using control rules derived by making use of the sensor data only for formation alignment. The sensors consist of discrete, binary optical detectors arranged in a certain geometric pattern. The vehicle design, including estimation of levitation lifetime, sensor design, and vehicle excursion due to an air-jet pulse, are discussed first. Then the control rules are described in detail. The effectiveness of the proposed sensor-control combination in formation alignment is determined both experimentally and via computer simulation. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB Promising massive emissions reduction and energy savings, the utilization of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in last-mile parcel delivery is continuously expanding. However, the limited UAV range deters their widescale adoption to replace ground modes of transportation. Moreover, real-world data on the impact of different parameters on the operation, emissions, and energy consumption is scarce. This study aims to assess the impact of airspace planning and discretization on the energy consumption of autonomous UAVs. We utilize a novel open-source comprehensive UAV autonomous programming framework and a digital-twin model to simulate real-world three-dimensional operation. The framework integrates airspace policies, UAV kinematics, and autonomy to accurately estimate the operational energy consumption via an experimentally verified energy model. In the simulated case study, airspace is discretized by both a traditional Cartesian method and a novel dynamic 4D discretization (Skyroutes) method. This allows for the comparison of different routing and trajectory planning algorithms for ten missions. The results show a variation in the energy consumption by up to 50%, which demonstrates the criticality of airspace discretization and planning on UAV charging infrastructure design, greenhouse gas emissions reduction, and airspace management.

AB The aim of the article is to give an overview of human factor research in psychology applicable to autonomous driving. The study is centered around situation awareness, a widely used concept in human factor research regarding the operation of automated and semi-automated systems (and communication between autonomous vehicles and humans). A proposal is put forward for structuring situation awareness requirements for autonomous driving, which could be a starting point for defining such requirements, and may foster a discussion on the issues associated with the human factor in relation to autonomous driving. Two models of human error (the SHELL model and the Swiss cheese model) are also introduced, one of which represents an integrated approach of error in situations that involve humans working with complex machinery or instruments, while the other represents a more superficial viewpoint on the multicausal nature of errors. The present overview can provide an appropriate basis for a discussion about the role of the driver in autonomous vehicles, and the place of human factor research in the emerging field of self-driving technology.

AB Industrial micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) with robotic manipulators have numerous applications in search and rescue tasks that reduce risks to human beings. However, such tasks distinctly require MAVs to have the capability of real-time autonomous navigation only with onboard sensors, especially in GPS-denied applications. This article introduces a new approach to onboard vision-based autonomous state estimation and mapping for MAVs' navigation in unknown environments. The algorithms run on board and do not need an external positioning system to assist autonomous navigation. The state estimator is developed to provide MAV's current pose on the basis of the extended Kalman filter by using image patch features. Inverse depth convergence monitoring and local bundle adjustment are utilized to improve the accuracy. The mapping algorithm for navigation is developed according to a real-time stereo matching method for three-dimensional perception. Finally, we have performed several experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Future connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) will operate at different autonomous levels for decades. Therefore, we propose a novel prioritisation scheme according to the autonomous levels of CAVs, and a corresponding multiple access mechanism, to be named full-duplex prioritised scheduling (FDPS) protocol, to enhance the delivery of high-priority packets in future New Radio (NR) enhanced vehicle-to-everything communication (eV2X) vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). Comparing to the standardised sensing-based semi-persistent scheduling (SB-SPS) protocol, this paper presents how collision detection is enabled during the broadcast, how collisions are resolved, how the priority of a packet from a colliding CAV is recognised, and how the broadcast of high-priority packets is enhanced. Both protocols are evaluated through mathematical formulations and simulations in terms of average successful packet delivery rate (PDR), collision duration, and latency. Simulation results have firstly validated the mathematical analysis, they have also shown the enhancement of packets delivery in future NR eV2X VANETs when the self-interference suppression (SIS) factor is better than 16, which is achievable by deploying the existing SIS technologies.

AB Adverse weather conditions such as fog, haze, snow, mist and glare create visibility problems for applications of autonomous vehicles. To ensure safe and smooth operations in frequent bad weather scenarios, image dehazing is crucial to any vehicular motion and navigation task on road or air. Moreover, the commonly deployed mobile systems are resource constrained in nature. Therefore, it is important to ensure memory, compute and run-time efficiency of dehazing algorithms. In this manuscript we propose ReViewNet, a fast, lightweight and robust dehazing system suitable for autonomous vehicles. The network uses components like spatial feature pooling, quadruple color-cue, multi-look architecture and multi-weighted loss to effectively dehaze images captured by cameras of autonomous vehicles. The effectiveness of the proposed model is analyzed by exhaustive quantitative evaluation on five benchmark datasets demonstrating its supremacy over other existing state-of-the-art methods. Further, a component-wise ablation and loss weight ratio analysis demonstrates the contribution of each and every component of the network. We also show the qualitative analysis with special use cases and visual responses on distinctive vehicular vision instances, establishing the effectiveness of the proposed method in numerous hazy weather conditions for autonomous vehicular applications.

AB An autonomous vehicle (AV) requires an accurate perception of its surrounding environment to operate reliably. The perception system of an AV, which normally employs machine learning (e.g., deep learning), transforms sensory data into semantic information that enables autonomous driving. Object detection is a fundamental function of this perception system, which has been tackled by several works, most of them using 2D detection methods. However, the 2D methods do not provide depth information, which is required for driving tasks, such as path planning, collision avoidance, and so on. Alternatively, the 3D object detection methods introduce a third dimension that reveals more detailed object's size and location information. Nonetheless, the detection accuracy of such methods needs to be improved. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey on 3D object detection methods used for autonomous driving applications. This paper presents an overview of 3D object detection methods and prevalently used sensors and datasets in AVs. It then discusses and categorizes the recent works based on sensors modalities into monocular, point cloudbased, and fusion methods. We then summarize the results of the surveyed works and identify the research gaps and future research directions.

AB In the context of automated and connected vehicle technology, this paper proposes an environment-on-board predictive braking control system, regulating the vehicle velocity to a desired value, in order to enhance path-following performance and vehicle stability when a vehicle is driven on a path where the road friction coefficient changes suddenly on a curve. In this study, we assume that the vehicle enters a wet road from a dry road and moves on to a dry road, and that the forward road surface friction condition can be estimated. In such driving situation, the objective of the vehicle dynamics control system is to improve path-following performance and vehicle stability of automated vehicle, even under abnormal road conditions. To achieve this objective, the predictive braking control is designed to track a safe velocity which is determined based on a simplified linear two-degree-of-freedom bicycle and a 2nd order look-ahead driver model. The effectiveness of this control system is verified using a nonlinear four-degree-of-freedom four-wheel model under various conditions, with varying road friction coefficients and curvatures. Finally, the effectiveness is evaluated using a full vehicle model of the IPG CarMaker, which is similar to an actual vehicle.

AB Differential dynamic programming (DDP) is a well-recognized method for trajectory optimization due to its fast convergence characteristics. However, the original DDP requires a predefined final time and cannot handle nonlinear constraints in optimization. This prohibits the application of DDP for autonomous vehicles due to the heuristic nature of setting a final time beforehand and the existence of inherent physical limits. This article revisits DDP by dynamically optimizing the final time via the first-order optimality condition of the value function and using augmented Lagrangian method to tackle the issue of nonlinear constraints. The resultant algorithm is termed as flexible final time constrained differential dynamic programming (FFT-CDDP). Extensive numerical simulations for a three-dimensional guidance problem are used to demonstrate the working of FFT-CDDP. The results indicate that the proposed FFT-CDDP provides much higher computational efficiency and stronger robustness against the initial solution guess, compared with the off-the-shelf general purpose optimal control software (GPOPS) algorithm.

ID NETWORKING
AB Autonomous and software-defined vehicles (ASDVs) feature highly complex systems, coupling safety-critical and non-critical components such as infotainment. These systems require the highest connectivity, both inside the vehicle and with the outside world. An effective solution for network communication lies in Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) which enables high-bandwidth and low-latency communications in a mixed-criticality environment. In this work, we present Time-Sensitive Autonomous Architectures (TSAA) to enable TSN in ASDVs. The software architecture is based on a hypervisor providing strong isolation and virtual access to TSN for virtual machines (VMs). TSAA latest iteration includes an autonomous car controlled by two Xilinx accelerators and a multiport TSN switch. We discuss the engineering challenges and the performance evaluation of the project demonstrator. In addition, we propose a Proof-of-Concept design of virtualized TSN to enable multiple VMs executing on a single board taking advantage of the inherent guarantees offered by TSN.

AB Driving scene understanding is an essential technique for realizing autonomous driving. Although many large-scale datasets for autonomous driving have enabled studies in terms of driving scene understanding, unpaved dirt roads have not been considered as their target driving environment. Drivable region identification is important in dirt roads to prevent damage to the vehicle and passengers. Semantic segmentation of camera images and lidar point clouds have been used to recognize the environment around an autonomous vehicle. The road and objects are recognized by classifying image pixels and point clouds into semantic classes. In this study, we introduce a perception method for drivable region identification on dirt roads through fusion of image and point cloud semantic segmentation. Our approach includes an image semantic segmentation algorithm and a point cloud semantic segmentation algorithm, which we combine into a bird's-eye-view grid map format. To transform the point-wise drivable region identification results into the area-wise information, we adopt the alphashape algorithm. Speed improvements are made by using small proportion of drivable points, and the accuracy degradation is compensated by accumulating the perception results along the time.

AB This study addresses the development of algorithms for multiple target detection and tracking in the framework of sensor fusion and its application to autonomous navigation and collision avoidance systems for the unmanned surface vehicle (USV) Aragon. To provide autonomous navigation capabilities, various perception sensors such as radar, lidar, and cameras have been mounted on the USV platform and automatic ship detection algorithms are applied to the sensor measurements. The relative position information between the USV and nearby objects is obtained to estimate the motion of the target objects in a sensor-level tracking filter. The estimated motion information from the individual tracking filters is then combined in a central-level fusion tracker to achieve persistent and reliable target tracking performance. For automatic ship collision avoidance, the combined track data are used as obstacle information, and appropriate collision avoidance maneuvers are designed and executed in accordance with the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea (COLREGs). In this paper, the development processes of the vehicle platform and the autonomous navigation algorithms are described, and the results of field experiments are presented and discussed.

AB The Paris Agreement set global energy conservation and emission reduction standards in 2016, and the ambitious goal of carbon neutrality must be achieved by 2050. However, the conflicts between environmental protection, economic development and social fairness constrain the development of sustainable transportation systems. At the same time, the automotive industry believes that large-scale application of autonomous driving technology is expected by 2050. The development and application of autonomous driving technology can provide a new solution to improve the sustainability of the transportation system. Meanwhile, autonomous vehicles can significantly enhance the mobility of people with disabilities and seniors and reduce the transportation cost for poverty people, improving the transportation fairness of the entire society. This letter discusses the impact of autonomous driving technology on sustainable transportation systems from the perspectives of social fairness and economic responsibility, as a brief summary of the third part of Distributed/Decentralized Hybrid Workshop on Sustainability for Transportation and Logistics (DHW-STL).

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are becoming more common and the market size is growing. In the truck industry, the deployment of a platoon of AVs is emerging as a response to existing safety and environmental problems. However, before autonomous technology can be applied to all vehicles in a traffic flow, mixed traffic containing both AVs and non-autonomous vehicles (NVs) is inevitable. In this study, using a driving simulator and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index survey, the behaviour of NVs at highway inflows and outflows was analysed to understand platoon operation management in mixed-traffic conditions. Unlike previous studies, this study considered an environment in which automated freight vehicle platoons occupy a designated lane and examined vehicle driving characteristics and driver psychology as NVs entered and exited the highway. Statistical methods (analysis of variance and multi-variable analysis of variance) were used to analyse differences according to the situation. It was found that, in entry, a platoon had an effect on drivers and the platoon size had a larger effect than inter-platoon spacing. However, among drivers with driving experience above a certain level, the platoon parameters did not have significant effects on driving. The results of this study provide basic information about the operation and management of a platoon of AVs on mixed-traffic highways.

AB The Department of Transport in the United Kingdom recorded 25,080 motor vehicle fatalities in 2019. This situation stresses the need for an intelligent transport system (ITS) that improves road safety and security by avoiding human errors with the use of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Therefore, this survey discusses the current development of two main components of an ITS: (1) gathering of AVs surrounding data using sensors; and (2) enabling vehicular communication technologies. First, the paper discusses various sensors and their role in AVs. Then, various communication technologies for AVs to facilitate vehicle to everything (V2X) communication are discussed. Based on the transmission range, these technologies are grouped into three main categories: long-range, medium-range and short-range. The short-range group presents the development of Bluetooth, ZigBee and ultra-wide band communication for AVs. The medium-range examines the properties of dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). Finally, the long-range group presents the cellular-vehicle to everything (C-V2X) and 5G-new radio (5G-NR). An important characteristic which differentiates each category and its suitable application is latency. This research presents a comprehensive study of AV technologies and identifies the main advantages, disadvantages, and challenges.

ID PATH-TRACKING
AB In this paper, a novel Lyapunov-based robust controller by using meta-heuristic optimization algorithm has been proposed for lateral control of an autonomous vehicle. In the first step, double lane change path has been designed using a fifth-degree polynomial (quantic) function and dynamic constraints. A lane changing path planning method has been used to design the double lane change manoeuvre. In the next step, position and orientation errors have been extracted based on the two-degree-of-freedom vehicle bicycle model. A combination of sliding mode and backstepping controllers has been used to control the steering in this paper. Overall stability of the combined controller has been analytically proved by defining a Lyapunov function and based on Lyapunov stability theorem. The proposed controller includes some constant parameters which have effects on controller performance; therefore, particle swarm optimization algorithm has been used for finding optimum values of these parameters. The comparing result of the proposed controller with backstepping controller illustrated the better performance of the proposed controller, especially in the low road frictions. Simulation of designed controllers has been conducted by linking CarSim software with Matlab/Simulink which provides a nonlinear full vehicle model. The simulation was performed for manoeuvres with different durations and road frictions. The proposed controller has outperformed the backstepping controller, especially in low frictions.

AB Providing mobility services effectively to residents and visitors is a complex socio-technical system task to city public managers. Smart mobility systems aim to support the efficient exploitation of city transport facilities and sustainable mobility within the urban environment. People need to travel quickly and conveniently between locations at different scales, ranging from a few blocks within a city to a journey across cities. At the same time, goods need to be timely delivered, considering both the users and the businesses' needs. Several cities indicated an interest in using Autonomous Vehicles (AV) for the "last-mile" mobility services in the last few years. With them, it seems to be easier to get people and goods around using fewer vehicles. In this context, Autonomous Shuttles (AS) are beginning to be thought of as a new mobility/delivery service into the city center where narrow streets are not easily served by traditional buses. They allow them to perform critical areas with minimal new infrastructure and reduce noise and pollution. The article analyses the state-of-art on autonomous shuttles by proposing four application scenarios targeting the last-mile delivery of goods, the tourist experiences, and the shared and integrated mobility. Furthermore, we contribute with the proposition of the Autonomous Shuttles-as-a service (ASaaS) concept as the key pillar for the realization of innovative and sustainable proximity mobility. Our research proposed new research challenges for ASaaS, and we discuss social implications and governance challenges that consider user engagement and sustainability. It also recommended extending new research to focus on simulation and machine learning techniques for last-mile mobility planning and explore the journeys tracking certification via artificial intelligence and blockchain-based techniques.

ID OWNERSHIP; OPINION
AB City transport systems often struggle to cope with high volumes of traffic and become congested, despite the use of various traffic management strategies. The concentration of traffic around city centres results in pollution and poor urban air quality, although the increasing popularity of electric vehicles is helping ameliorate these effects. One reason for the growing momentum behind electric vehicles is the emergence of mobility operators such as car-sharing companies, who target users wishing to rent out vehicles on a short-term basis. There is currently rapid growth in one-way car-sharing, in which the vehicle can be dropped off at a different location to the pickup point. Crucially, one-way car-sharing gives the opportunity for travellers to utilise car sharing in conjunction with other modes, such as public transport modes, for their journey provided the requisite intermodal connections are present. This paper looks at how one-way electric vehicle car-sharing systems have the potential to become important components of future city transport systems. The future role of shared autonomous vehicles is also considered.

AB We present a review of 3D point cloud processing and learning for autonomous driving. As one of the most important sensors in autonomous vehicles (AVs), lidar sensors collect 3D point clouds that precisely record the external surfaces of objects and scenes. The tools for 3D point cloud processing and learning are critical to the map creation, localization, and perception modules in an AV. Although much attention has been paid to data collected from cameras, such as images and videos, an increasing number of researchers have recognized the importance and significance of lidar in autonomous driving and have proposed processing and learning algorithms that exploit 3D point clouds. We review the recent progress in this research area and summarize what has been tried and what is needed for practical and safe AVs. We also offer perspectives on open issues that are needed to be solved in the future.

AB Plitvice Lakes National Park is the largest national park in Croatia and also the oldest from 1949. It was added to the UNESCO World Natural Heritage List in 1979, due to the unique physicochemical and biological conditions that have led to the creation of 16 named and several smaller unnamed lakes, which are cascading one into the next. Previous scientific research proved that the increased amount of dissolved organic matter (pollution) stops the travertine processes on Plitvice Lakes. Therefore, this complex, dynamic but also fragile geological, biological and hydrological system required a comprehensive limnological survey. Thirteen of the sixteen lakes mentioned above were initially surveyed from the air by an unmanned aircraft equipped with a survey grade GNSS and a full frame high-resolution full-screen camera. From these recordings, a georeferenced, high-resolution orthophoto was generated, on which the following surveys by a multibeam sonar depended. It is important to mention that this was the first time that these lakes had ever been surveyed both with the multibeam sonar technique and with such a high-resolution camera. Due to the fact that these thirteen lakes are difficult to reach and often too shallow for a boat-mounted sonar, a special autonomous surface vehicle was developed. The lakes were surveyed by the autonomous surface vehicle mounted with a multibeam sonar to create detailed bathymetric models of the lakes. The missions were planned for the surface vehicle based on the orthophoto from the preliminary studies. A detailed description of the methodology used to survey the different lakes is given here. In addition, the resulting high-resolution bathymetric maps are presented and analysed together with an overview of average, maximum depths and number of data points. Numerous interesting depressions, which are phenomena consistent with previous studies of Plitvice Lakes, are noted at the lake beds and their causes are discussed. This study shows the huge potential of remote sensing technologies integrated into autonomous vehicles in terms of much faster surveys, several orders of magnitude more data points (compared to manual surveys of a few decades ago), as well as data accuracy, precision and georeferencing.

AB The development of smart highway and vehicle-road collaboration has stimulated the market applications of automated vehicles. However, consumer acceptance of automated vehicles will influence the time course of automated driving technology promotion. This research explores user acceptance and demand for automated vehicles based on vehicle-road collaboration and identifies which factors drive the acceptance of automated vehicles. A sample of 3900 questionnaires are obtained through classification sampling. The descriptive statistical analysis of 3594 effective multi-source sample data shows that the user acceptance of automated vehicles based on the vehicle-road collaborative environment is 70.94%. The results show that the five categories of groups have significant differences in the acceptance of automated vehicles, and the focus on individual variables is higher than the overall acceptance. Due to the contradiction and dependence among various variables, multiple regression analysis is introduced. The results show that the six variables of safety, practicability, economy, highly automated driving functions, vehicle-road collaborative fusion application, and after-sale service have a significant positive impact on the acceptance of automated vehicles. The reasons why these six factors affect user acceptance are then analyzed in depth. The fitting model and acceptance value range obtained by this research can be used for market research. The research findings provide data support and theoretical reference for the research and development, marketing, teaching, and servicing of autonomous driving technology.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are entering the market, which will have a great impact on future decision making on mode choice in transportation systems. The aim of this study is to explore the determinants which influence travelers' intentions to use AVs based on structural equation modelling (SEM). 310 valid sets of data from an online survey were collected to analyze factors which influence travelers' intentions. Data analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 23 and AMOS 23. The results showed that personality and preferences in relation to AVs are the main potential factors that cause travelers' AVs use. Attitudes to modal services also affect intentions to use AVs. Personality has a significant positive effect on both attitude and preferences. The results provide exploratory empirical support for all hypotheses. The research results will help understand travelers' choice motivation from psychological and service perspectives, and provide support for governments and enterprises to improve the management and services of autonomous vehicles.

AB The emergence of on-demand shared autonomous electric vehicle (SAEV) service requires careful charging station planning and a joint charging and repositioning strategy to mitigate empty travel. This study couples charging and repositioning events as a means of improving service quality (rider wait times), reducing empty travel due to repositioning or charging, and improving fleet utilization (average daily trips per vehicle and charging queues). This synergy is explored for the Austin, Texas region using POLARIS, an agent-based model. On average, wait times were 39% lower, and average daily trips served per SAEV increased up to 6.4 (or 28%) compared to SAEV repositioning with heuristic charging. Coupling repositioning with charging decreased the fleet's percent empty travel on average by 1.6%, relative to the scenario treating them as independent events (which varies by charging station design). Sparser charging stations reduce investment costs, and operators can leverage this framework to keep traveler wait times low.

AB Autonomous vehicles are poised to generate revolutionary impact on urban mobility and parking availability. This study aims to model the morning commute dynamics in a multi-modal transportation system and examine how to regulate the market in the presence of parking space constraint and shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). Other than the SAVs, commuters can also choose to take regular vehicles (RVs) or public transit (PT) to travel from home to workplace. SAVs will compete the bottleneck capacity with RVs. The dynamic departure patterns and endogenous penetration rate of SAVs are determined depending on parking supply and other related factors. The conditions for various portfolios of travel modes are derived in details. Analytical propositions, numerical examples, as well as policy implications are given with respect to different market factors such as the additional SAV cost, and parking supply. The results show that there are two possible system optimal solutions depending on the value of transit fare. When the transit fare is low, the system optimum occurs in Scenario CS II&III, wherein all three travel modes are used, the first SAV commuter arrives at the bottleneck just when the last RV commuter leaves, and the parking supply and the additional SAV cost should be controlled to a suitable value; when the transit fare is relatively high, the system optimum appears in Scenario IV, an extreme scenario wherein the parking supply is zero, and only the travel modes of PT and SAVs are used.

AB Increasing focus is being paid to ensuring safety in autonomous driving. The current paper addresses the challenge of collision avoidance with dynamic surrounding vehicles in different driving situations. The established solution formulated utilizing Model Predictive Control (MPC) includes decision making and trajectory planning. A simplified prediction model is used, which takes into account the relative positions and velocities of the surrounding vehicles and the ego vehicle. Depending on traffic conditions, which are stated as constraints in the MPC formulation, the ego vehicle may perform lane keeping, lane shift, overtaking or braking to avoid collision with the road participants. The decision making constraints are included into the MPC in a mixed integer formulation-like manner. The safety constraints are defined using the Sigmoid function and the braking barrier to define the navigable zone of the ego vehicle. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated through simulation, with different scenarios revealing its effectiveness.

AB This paper presents track fusion and behavioral reasoning for moving vehicles in close proximity based on the curvilinear coordinates of roadway geometries. The inferred track and behavior of other vehicles can be used to perform safe actions in intelligent vehicle applications and autonomous driving. Vehicle detections from multiple perception sensors are integrated using track-to-track (T2T) fusion based on a cross-covariance method, and this T2T fusion is pet-forum' with curvilinear coordinates created using prebuilt roadway geometry on a digital map. The coordinate conversion to curvilinear space has many benefits for behavioral reasoning and tracking, such as constraining problem spaces and dimensions. A machine learning classifier based on a support vector machine is then applied to deduce the behavior of nearby vehicles. The algorithms presented here for track fusion and behavioral reasoning based on curvilinear coordinates have been verified through experiments in various real traffic scenarios.

AB Optimal employment of autonomous wide area search munitions or unmanned aerial vehicles is considered. The air vehicle searches a battle space for stationary targets in the presence of false targets and/or clutter. Control problems are formulated to achieve optimal scheduling of the control variables P-TR, the probability of target report, which is a reflection of the sensor's threshold setting, and Q, the area coverage rate. These optimal control problem formulations yield solutions that maximize the probability of target attack, and constraints to also satisfy hard bounds on the probability of false target attacks may also be applied. Analysis has shown that the optimal solutions are sensitive to the particular relationship between the autonomous target recognition module's receiver operating characteristic parameter,, and area coverage rate, Q. In this paper the relationship is developed from first principles for both passive and active sensors, and the optimal P-TR and Q schedules are obtained.

ID LIDAR; MODEL
AB Detecting dynamic vehicles is of great significance in the field of autonomous vehicles. In the literature, a few vehicle detection methods are proposed to detect vehicles within 50 m from the Lidar, where the point clouds are relatively dense. It is a great challenge to detect vehicles that are far from the Lidar because of sparse point clouds. Fewer returned point clouds will result in a larger fitting randomness and lower detection rate. To tackle this issue, a dynamic vehicle detection method based on likelihood-field-based model combined with coherent point drift (CPD), which includes the steps of dynamic object detection and dynamic vehicle confirmation, is proposed in this paper. An adaptive threshold based on the distance and grid angular resolution is applied to detect the dynamic objects. The pose estimation based on CPD (PE-CPD) is proposed to estimate the vehicle pose. The scaling series algorithm coupled with a Bayesian filter that is improved by PE-CPD is utilized for updating the vehicle states. Finally, comparative experiments of vehicle detection based on KITTI data sets are conducted. The results show that the proposed method improves the detection rate, especially the detection in the radius of 40-80 m, which is termed as distant area, compared with the method based on pose estimation with modified scaling series.

The authors show how passivity-based techniques and consensus tracking theories are brought together to yield a distributed control strategy, by which the problems existing in current literature that a common reference velocity signal being available to all cooperating vehicles are explicitly extended. The desired coordinated behaviour is achieved by means of consensus on the velocity of path parameter of a virtual dynamic leader. The stability of the overall closed-loop system is analysed mathematically by adopting nested Matrosov theorem. To demonstrate the controller proposed, simulations results are presented and discussed.

AB A reliable critical-scenario-based safety assessment of autonomous vehicles in China requires a thorough understanding of complex crash scenarios in Chinese background traffic. Based on actual crashes between a vehicle and a powered two-wheeler (PTW) in China, this study generated the autonomous driving testing scenarios from functional, logical and concrete levels. First, 239 video-recorded crash cases were selected from the China In-depth mobility Safety Study - Traffic Accident (CIMSS-TA) database. Using the k-medoids clustering method, six functional scenarios were generalized according to seven crash characteristics (time of day, road type, road surface, obstruction, motion of vehicle, motion of PTW, relative moving direction and position of PTW with respect to vehicle), which contained two straight road scenarios, two T-junction scenarios and two intersection scenarios. Then, using a trajectory analysis program written by Python, the dangerous time instant of each crash was extracted based on the relative trajectory. According to five dynamic parameters of dangerous time instant, namely vehicle velocity (Vehicle_V), PTW X'-coordinate velocity (PTW_VX'), PTW Y'-coordinate velocity (PTW_VY'), PTW X'-coordinate relative position (PTW_LocX') and PTW Y'-coordinate relative position (PTW_LocY'), a crash trigger scheme was built to remain a case challenging when the involved vehicle is replaced by an autonomous vehicle with completely different maneuvers. Using the kernel density estimation (KDE), the logical scenarios were evolved by calculating the distribution of these dynamic parameters in each cluster. The results showed that there were differences in the distribution of dynamic parameters between six functional scenarios. For instance, the Vehicle_V in the scenario where a vehicle turning right impacts with a right/right rear PTW traveling straight ahead was higher than that in the scenario where a vehicle changing to the left lane impacts with a left/left rear PTW traveling straight ahead, with ranges of (10 km/h, 30 km/h) and (5 km/h, 15 km/h), respectively. Finally, considering the correlation of dynamic parameters, a virtual crash generation approach based on the independent component analysis (ICA) representing the original crashes with independent parameters was proposed to obtain sufficient concrete testing scenarios. The results showed that the statistical characteristics of virtual crashes were consistent with those of original crashes. Therefore, the virtual crash generation approach was effective. And a concrete crossing testing scenario with the crash trigger conditions of Vehicle_V = 26.272 km/h, PTW_VX' = 15.567 km/h, PTW_VY' = -1.670 km/h, PTW_LocX' = -27.265 m and PTW_LocY' = 52. 149 m was especially demonstrated. This study provides a theoretical basis for generating autonomous driving testing scenarios and data support for establishing relevant testing schemes tailored to the traffic environment in China.

ID ALGORITHM
AB The generation of accurate terrain maps while navigating over off-road, irregular terrains is a complex challenge, due to the difficulties in the estimation of the pose of the laser rangefinders, which is required for the proper registration of the range measurements. This paper addresses this problem. The proposed methodology uses an Extended Kalman filter to estimate in real-time the instantaneous pose of the vehicle and the laser rangefinders by considering measurements acquired from an inertial measurement unit, internal sensorial data of the vehicle and the estimated heights of the four wheels, which are obtained from the terrain map and allow determination of the vehicle's inclination. The estimated 6D pose of the laser rangefinders is used to correctly project the laser measurements onto the terrain map. The terrain map is a 2.5D map that stores in each cell the mean value and variance of the terrain height. In each map's cell position, new laser observations are fused with existing height estimations using a Kalman filter. The proposed methodology is validated in the real world using an autonomous vehicle. Field trials show that the use of the proposed state estimation methodology produces maps with much higher accuracy than the standard approaches.

Firstly, a coordinated error of depth between vehicles and the common desired depth is defined by using extended graph theory in a distributed manner; then a deep-pitch double loop control algorithm based on sliding mode is designed for each vehicle, by which each vehicle is driven to and move at the common depth coordinately. In particular, a pitch reference command is firstly calculated by the predefined coordinated depth error, which can be regarded as the outer loop control, and then, the input rudder angle for each vehicle is derived according to the pitch reference command being as the inner loop control. Considering the uncertainties of the model hydrodynamic parameters, an online parameter adaptive algorithm is introduced to improve the performance of the sliding mode control algorithm proposed. Simulations were performed to verify the theoretical results proposed.

ID POSE ESTIMATION; GENERATION; MARKERS
AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) autonomous approaching and landing on mobile platforms always play an important role in various application scenarios. Such a complicated autonomous task requires an integrated multi-sensor system to guarantee environmental adaptability in contrast to using each sensor individually. Multi-sensor fusion perception demonstrates great feasibility to compensate for adverse visual events, undesired vibrations of inertia sensors, and satellite positioning loss. In this paper, a UAV autonomous landing scheme based on multi-sensor fusion is proposed. In particular, Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) sensor, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and vision feedback are integrated to guide the UAV to approach and land on a moving object. In the approaching stage, a UWB-IMU-based sensor fusion algorithm is proposed to provide relative position estimation of vehicles with real time and high consistency. Such a sensor integration addresses the open challenge of inaccurate satellite positioning when the UAV is near the ground. It can also be extended to satellite-denied environmental applications. When the landing platform is detected by the onboard camera, the UAV performs autonomous landing. In the landing stage, the vision sensor is involved. With the visual feedback, a deep-learning-based detector and local pose estimator are enabled when the UAV approaches the landing platform. To validate the feasibility of the proposed autonomous landing scheme, both simulation and real-world experiments in extensive scenes are performed. As a result, the proposed landing scheme can land successfully with adequate accuracy in most common scenarios.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) applications focusing on energy optimization have attracted a lot of attention recently. However, it is challenging to evaluate various optimizations and controls in real-world traffic scenarios due to safety and technical concerns. In light of this, our previous work has developed a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed with a laboratory powertrain research platform to evaluate CAV applications. An actual engine is loaded by a hydrostatic dynamometer whose loading torque is controlled in real-time by the simulated vehicle dynamics. The HIL testbed mimics the performance of a target vehicle and the dynamometer generates the same load as the target vehicle. In this work, the HIL testbed is further enhanced to match the performance of actual testing vehicles at the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and a living lab is developed to incorporate real traffic information. The same engine as the actual testing vehicles at the FHWA was installed and the vehicle models were calibrated using testing data from actual vehicles. The same roadway conditions (speed limit, the degree of road slope, etc.) were input into the testbed and the dynamometer generates the same load as an actual vehicle's engine is getting. The HIL testbed emulates the performance of an actual vehicle and both fuel consumption and emissions are measured by precise instruments in the lab. In eight testing scenarios, the results have shown that the performance of the HIL testbed matches very well with the actual testing vehicles with about 1% error. In addition, the living lab has enabled the HIL testbed to interact with real traffic and extended the testing capabilities of the HIL testbed. Two new testing capabilities have been demonstrated through two CAV applications. This is an exciting result since the HIL testbed could provide an effective and economical way for the testing of fuel consumption and emissions on various roadway conditions for CAVs and other types of vehicles.

AB Accurate and seamless vehicle positioning is fundamental for autonomous driving tasks in urban environments, requiring the provision of high-end measuring devices. Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) sensors, together with Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers, are therefore commonly found onboard modern vehicles. In this paper, we propose an integration of lidar and GNSS code measurements at the observation level via a mixed measurement model. An Extended Kalman-Filter (EKF) is implemented to capture the dynamic of the vehicle movement, and thus, to incorporate the vehicle velocity parameters into the measurement model. The lidar positioning component is realized using point cloud registration through a deep neural network, which is aided by a high definition (HD) map comprising accurately georeferenced scans of the road environments. Experiments conducted in a densely built-up environment show that, by exploiting the abundant measurements of GNSS and high accuracy of lidar, the proposed vehicle positioning approach can maintain centimeter-to meter-level accuracy for the entirety of the driving duration in urban canyons.

AB Reactivity is a key component for autonomous vehicles navigating on natural terrains in order to safely avoid unknown obstacles. To this end, it is necessary to continuously assess traversability by processing on-board sensor data. This paper describes the case study of mobile robot Andabata that classifies traversable points from 3D laser scans acquired in motion of its vicinity to build 2D local traversability maps. Realistic robotic simulations with Gazebo were employed to appropriately adjust reactive behaviors. As a result, successful navigation tests with Andabata using the robot operating system (ROS) were performed on natural environments at low speeds.

AB In this study, we proposed an adaptive fuzzy multi-surface sliding control (AFMSSC) for trajectory tracking of 6 degrees of freedom inertia coupled aerial vehicles with multiple inputs and multiple outputs (MIMO). It is shown that an adaptive fuzzy logic-based function approximator can be used to estimate the system uncertainties and an iterative multi-surface sliding control design can be carried out to control flight. Using AFMSSC on MIMO autonomous flight systems creates confluent control that can account for both matched and mismatched uncertainties, system disturbances and excitation in internal dynamics. It is proved that the AFMSSC system guarantees asymptotic output tracking and ultimate uniform boundedness of the tracking error. Simulation results are presented to validate the analysis.

AB This paper investigates the optimal data transmission for collaborative driving in autonomous vehicular networks (AVNs). We consider that vehicles communicate with each other based on the definition of Robot Operating System (ROS), which is a pervasively adopted middleware operating system for autonomous vehicles such as Baidu Apollo. ROS defines a publish/subscribe scheme for inter-vehicular communications, in which vehicles subscribe to "topics" published by adjacent vehicles; a "topic" is related to the real-time sensing/computing data that a vehicle intends to share with nearby neighbors, e.g., radar or camera images captured. By sharing various sensing data using different topics at the real-time, vehicles in the same area therefore can collaboratively drive with cooperative perception and computing. However, multiple data flows for different topics would coexist along overlapping transmission paths during this process. As a result, a fundamental issue raised is how to schedule the contending data flows in the mobile and bandwidth-constrained vehicular networks. In this paper, we model the ROS-based publish/subscribe scheme as an optimization problem which jointly considers the power allocation and conflict avoidance of the communication process in AVNs. By applying the Lyapunov Optimization, we decompose the model to calculate the power and sub-carrier proportion on each node while avoiding link conflicts, and finally obtain the optimal resource allocation strategy. By combining the corresponding link conflict constraints, we are able to encapsulate the optimization model in a stable set to efficiently avoid link conflicts, and thereby reduce the resource waste caused by the link interference and data flow conflicts. Using simulations, we show that our method has good advantages in resource optimization.

AB Due to the COVID-19 virus being highly transmittable, frequently cleaning and disinfecting facilities is common guidance in public places. However, the more often the environment is cleaned, the higher the risk of cleaning staff getting infected. Therefore, strong demand for sanitizing areas in automatic modes is undoubtedly expected. In this paper, an autonomous disinfection vehicle with an Ultraviolet-C (UVC) lamp is designed and implemented using an ultra-wideband (UWB) positioning sensor. The UVC dose for 90% inactivation of the reproductive ability of COVID-19 is 41.7 J/m(2), which a 40 W UVC lamp can achieve within a 1.6 m distance for an exposure time of 30 s. With this UVC lamp, the disinfection vehicle can effectively sterilize in various scenarios. In addition, the high-accuracy UWB positioning system, with the time difference of arrival (TDOA) algorithm, is also studied for autonomous vehicle navigation in indoor environments. The number of UWB tags that use a synchronization protocol between UWB anchors can be unlimited. Moreover, this proposed Gradient Descent (GD), which uses Taylor method, is a high-efficient algorithm for finding the optimal position for real-time computation due to its low error and short calculating time. The generalized traversal path planning procedure, with the edge searching method, is presented to improve the efficiency of autonomous navigation. The average error of the practical navigation demonstrated in the meeting room is 0.10 m. The scalability of the designed system to different application scenarios is also discussed and experimentally demonstrated. Hence, the usefulness of the proposed UWB sensor applied to UVC disinfection vehicles to prevent COVID-19 infection is verified by employing it to sterilize indoor environments without human operation.

AB A multi-vehicle flocking and guidance control scheme is proposed for small autonomous underwater vehicles in the presence of strong ocean flows that exceed vehicles' actuation capabilities. The flocking problem and flock guidance problem are simultaneously addressed by enduing fluid properties to the vehicle swarm. This control scheme generates cohesive flocking behavior with inherent inter-vehicle collision avoidance and velocity consensus. The vehicle flock is guided along a fuel-optimal trajectory calculated for an individual vehicle based on background flow predictions, allowing us to compute a single optimal trajectory while still achieving robust flocking performance and near optimality for all vehicles. Resultant vehicle trajectories are nearly fuel-optimal when the spatial variation of background flow velocities across the flock is small. Dimensional analysis uncovers two important independent parameters dictating the balance between swarm compressibility and the degree of velocity consensus. The efficiency of the presented method is demonstrated in simulations with two synthetic background flow fields resembling realistic ocean flow patterns, and a flow field reconstructed based on ocean model data. A quantitative comparison with a generic artificial potential based control scheme shows that, owing to the inherent velocity consensus effect, the proposed method results in better flocking behavior endless actuation energy consumption.

AB This paper presents an integrated controller for an autonomous articulated electric vehicle (AAEV) for path tracking and rollover prevention. The AAEV is vulnerable to rollover due to the characteristics of the articulated frame steering (AFS) mechanism, which shows improved maneuverability and agility but not front wheel steering. In addition, the ratio between height and track width is high, so the AAEV is prone to rolling over. Therefore, the proposed controller was designed to achieve the two goals, following the reference path and managing the velocity to improve the safety of the AAEV. Vehicle behavior was modeled by a kinematic model with actuation delay. A local linearization was used to improve the accuracy of the vehicle model and reduce the computational load. Reference states of the position and heading were determined to follow the reference path and prevent the rollover. A model predictive control (MPC)-based reference state tracker was designed to optimize the articulation angle rate and longitudinal acceleration commands. The simulation study was conducted to evaluate the proposed algorithm with a comparison of the base algorithms. The reference path for the simulation was an S-shaped path with discontinuous curvature. Simulation results showed that the proposed algorithm reduces the path tracking error and load-transfer ratio.

AB Introduction: A recognised potential benefit of autonomous vehicles is increased mobility for older adults. However, this group is more apprehensive about adoption, which may hinder uptake. Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) represent a use case that may be especially relevant for older people due to emerging applications in retirement villages and similar precincts. However, little research has examined the SAV-related concerns of older adults and strategies to address them. This study used an exploratory approach involving SAV exposure to identify strategies that may increase older people's receptiveness to SAVs. Method: Older adults living in retirement villages (n = 63) were interviewed while interacting with an SAV to examine their needs, expectations, and concerns regarding SAVs. The interview data were coded and thematically analysed. Results: Participants recommended the following approaches to ensuring SAVs are useful and acceptable to older adults: providing physical accessibility for those with mobility impairments, comfortable and practical internal layouts, and operating SAVs on convenient routes at useful speeds. Strategies such as exposing older adults to SAVs in operation to encourage uptake and initially ensuring a human assistant is present were suggested methods of increasing receptivity. Discussion: The findings suggest older passengers are likely to share many of the same reactions to SAVs as the broader population, but with a stronger focus on issues relating to accessibility and the physical layout of the vehicles. The solutions to these issues suggested by the study participants may be useful for those designing SAVs for use in older people's settings and beyond.

AB This work introduces a new method to calculate the water velocity components of a turbulent water column in the x, y, and z directions using Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) motion response (referred to as the 'WVAM method'). The water column velocities were determined by calculating the difference between the motion responses of the vehicle in calm and turbulent water environments. The velocity components obtained using the WVAM method showed good agreement with measurements from an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) mounted to the AUV. The standard deviation between the two datasets were below 0.09 m s(-1) for the velocity components in the x, y, and z directions, and were within the uncertainty margin of the ADCP measurements. With the WVAM method, it is possible to estimate the velocity components within close proximity to the AUV. This region encompasses the vehicle boundary layer and the ADCP blanking distance, which is not typically resolved. Estimating vertical and horizontal velocities around the boundary layer of the AUV is important for vehicle navigation and control system optimization, and to fill the blanking distance gap within a water column velocity profile, which is important for flow field characterization. The results show that it is possible to estimate the flow field in the vicinity of AUVs and other self-propelled vehicles.

AB Always keeping a certain distance between vehicles in a platoon system is important for collision avoidance. Centralized platoon systems let the leader vehicle determine and notify the velocities of all the vehicles in the platoon. Unfortunately, such a centralized method generates high packet drop rate and communication delay due to the leader vehicle's limited communication capability. Therefore, we propose a decentralized platoon network, in which each vehicle determines its velocity by only communicating with the vehicles in a short range. However, the multiple simultaneous transmissions between different pairs of vehicles may interfere with each other. By leveraging a typical feature of a platoon, we devise a channel allocation algorithm, called the Fast and Lightweight Autonomous channel selection algorithm (FLA), in which each vehicle determines its channel simply based on its distance to the leader vehicle. We also devise a strategy, in which a succeeding vehicle uses its stored common velocity profile when it is disconnected from its preceding vehicle and then adjusts its velocity once the connection is built. We conduct experiments on NS-3 and Matlab to evaluate the performance of our proposed methods and implement a real-world prototype by equipping vehicles with Android mobile devices. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our decentralized platoon network over the previous centralized platoon networks.

AB Autonomous parking in an indoor parking lot without human intervention is one of the most demanded and challenging tasks of autonomous driving systems. The key to this task is precise real-time indoor localization. However, state-of-the-art low-level visual feature-based simultaneous localization and mapping systems (VSLAM) suffer in monotonous or texture-less scenes and under poor illumination or dynamic conditions. Additionally, low-level feature-based mapping results are hard for human beings to use directly. In this paper, we propose a semantic landmark-based robust VSLAM for real-time localization of autonomous vehicles in indoor parking lots. The parking slots are extracted as meaningful landmarks and enriched with confidence levels. We then propose a robust optimization framework to solve the aliasing problem of semantic landmarks by dynamically eliminating suboptimal constraints in the pose graph and correcting erroneous parking slots associations. As a result, a semantic map of the parking lot, which can be used by both autonomous driving systems and human beings, is established automatically and robustly. We evaluated the real-time localization performance using multiple autonomous vehicles, and an repeatability of 0.3 m track tracing was achieved at a 10 kph of autonomous driving.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are bringing challenges and opportunities to urban traffic systems. One of the crucial challenges for traffic managers and local authorities is to understand the nonlinear change in road capacity with increasing AV penetration rate, and to efficiently reallocate the Right-of-Way (RoW) for the mixed flow of AVs and Human Driven Vehicles (HDVs). Most of the existing research suggests that road capacity will significantly increase at high AV penetration rates or an all-AV scenario, when AVs are able to drive with smaller headways to the leading vehicle. However, this increase in road capacity might not be significant at a lower AV penetration rate due to the heterogeneity between AVs and HDVs. In order to investigate the impacts of mixed flow conditions (AVs and HDVs), this paper firstly proposes a theoretical model to demonstrate that road capacity can be increased with proper RoW reallocation. Secondly, four different RoW reallocation strategies are compared using a SUMO simulation to cross-validate the results in a numerical analysis. A range of scenarios with different AV penetration rates and traffic demands are used. The results show that road capacity on a two-lane road can be significantly improved with appropriate RoW reallocation strategies at low or medium AV penetration rates, compared with the do-nothing RoW strategy.

AB In the transition era towards connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), the sharing of the roadway by CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) in a mixed-traffic stream is expected to pose safety and flow efficiency concerns even though CAVs may tend to adopt rather conservative maneuvering policies. Unfortunately, this will likely cause HDV drivers to unduly exploit such conservativeness by driving in ways that imperil safety. A context of this situation is lane-changing by the CAV, a potential major source of traffic disturbance at multi-lane highways that could impair their traffic flow efficiency. In dense, high-speed traffic conditions, it will be extremely unsafe for the CAV to change lanes without cooperation from neighboring vehicles in the traffic stream. To help address this issue, this paper developed a framework through which connected HDVs (CHDVs) could cooperate to facilitate safe and efficient lane-changing by the CAV. A numerical experiment was carried out to demonstrate the efficacy of the framework. The results indicated the CAVs' lane-changing feasibility and the overall duration of the lane-changing if the CAV carries out that maneuver. It was observed that throughout the lane-changing process, the safety of not only the CAV but also of all neighboring vehicles, was promoted through the framework's collision avoidance mechanism. The overall traffic flow efficiency was analyzed in terms of the ambient level of CHDV-CAV cooperation. Overall, the results of the study present evidence of how CHDV-CAV cooperation can help enhance the overall system efficiency.

SO JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY

ID UNDERWATER VEHICLES; ANTARCTIC KRILL
AB In oceanography, there has been a growing emphasis on coastal regions, partially because of their inherent complexity, as well as the increasing acknowledgment of anthropogenic impacts. To improve understanding and characterization of coastal dynamics, there has been significant effort devoted to the development of autonomous systems that sample the ocean on relevant scales. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are especially well suited for studies of the coastal ocean because they are able to provide near-synoptic spatial observations. These sampling platforms are beginning to transition from the engineering groups that developed and continue to improve them to the science user. With this transition comes novel applications of these vehicles to address new questions in coastal oceanography. Here, the relatively mature Remote Environmental Monitoring Units (REMUS) AUV system is described and assessed. Analysis of data, based on 37 missions and nearly 800 km of in-water operation, shows that the vehicle's navigational error estimates were consistently less than 10 m, and error estimates of mission duration, distance, velocity, and power usage, once the vehicle was properly ballasted, were below 10%. An example of the transition to science is demonstrated in an experiment conducted in 2002 in Monterey Bay, California, where the vehicle was used to quantify critical horizontal length scales of variability. Length scales on the order of tens to hundreds of meters were found for the region within 25 km of the coastline, which has significant implications for designing proper sampling approaches and parameterizing model domains. Results also demonstrate the overall utility of the REMUS vehicle for use by coastal oceanographers.

AB Crowd and evacuation management have been active areas of research and study over recent years. Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) could provide safe and vital life-saving reinforcement when evacuating populations from a large-scale disaster site. However, navigation in disaster-affected environments is vulnerable to the presence of unpredictable moving obstacles. Existing solutions perform optimal route determination while considering the presence of a single rescue vehicle. To optimize path planning and enhance energy efficiency in the presence of a fleet of rescue vehicles and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), multiple sources and target destinations, we propose a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Dijkstra (MADRD) algorithm in a sixth generation (6G) assisted environment to achieve cooperative navigation in the Route Planning Framework. The MADRD algorithm allows vehicles to learn from the experiences and behavior of other CAVs to obtain an optimal path from the source to the affected target site. Route selection and throttle parameters are optimized to achieve efficient fuel consumption, reduced travel time and lower traffic congestion. We simulate the Route Planning Framework on a large-scale real-world road network.

AB This manuscript investigated coordinated intersection signal design problem for mixed traffic flow of Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs) and Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Two main macroscopic impact of the mixed fiow on signal setting are considered: saturation fiow rate and the platoon dispersion. In order to capture the traffic fiow operational characteristics on coordinated intersections, three locations, namely entrance location where the loop detector was located at, and upstream intersection and downstream intersection were defined. Two types of vehicle cumulative curves, namely cumulative arrival profile and cumulative departure profile were constructed. The mixed-flow traffic dynamics were analyzed, and the arrival-departure curves relationship was derived using a combination of Newell car-following and Akcelik acceleration model. A mixed-flow platoon dispersion model was proposed to describe the vehicle's progression between two locations. Due to the nonlinear nature of the problem, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) method was employed to obtain the optimal signal parameters, including the cycle length, green duration, and optimal offset. The algorithm was implemented and validated in a case study involving two intersections, with the demand formulated and simulated by the Markov chain. The results showed that the proposed model could effectively decrease delays when compared with current signal control methods.

ID SCHEDULABILITY ANALYSIS; SYSTEMS
AB The rapid growth of autonomous driving in recent years has posed some new research challenges to the traditional vehicle control system. For example, in order to flexibly change the yaw rate and moving speed of a vehicle based on the detected road conditions, autonomous driving control often needs to dynamically tune its control parameters for better trajectory tracking and vehicle stability. Consequently, the execution time of driving control can increase significantly, resulting in missing the end-to-end (E2E) deadline from detection to computation and actuation, and thus possible accidents. In this paper, we propose AutoE2E, a two-tier real-time scheduling framework that helps the automotive OS meet the E2E deadlines of all the tasks despite execution time variations, while achieving the maximum possible computing precision for driving control. The inner loop of AutoE2E dynamically controls the CPU utilizations of all the on-board processors to stay below their respective schedulable utilization bounds, by adjusting the invocation rates of the vehicle control tasks running on those processors. The outer loop is designed to adapt the computation time of driving control and minimize the precision loss, when the inner loop loses its control capability due to rate saturation caused by vehicle speed changes. In particular, the outer loop features driver-oriented weight assignment and piecewise approximation for computing precision optimization of vehicle control tasks. Our evaluations, both on a hardware testbed with scaled cars and in larger-scale simulation, show that AutoE2E can effectively reduce the deadline miss ratio by 35.4% on average, compared to well-designed baselines, while having smaller precision loss and tracking errors.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have received a great deal of attention in recent years, with many commentators asking how these vehicles will "see" to navigate themselves and, more important, avoid colliding with people, other vehicles, and objects. This article analyzes how AVs see and the data sets they create through Jean Baudrillard's framework of simulation and simulacra, paying attention to how these technologies purify and classify the real into a series of representations. In doing so, it extends the existing critique of data-generating "smart" technologies and automation and additionally draws on visual theory to understand how the hyperreality of AVs is constructed. Technologies employed on AV trials such as light detection and ranging videos and virtual reality produce data sets that create a version of the urban environment that then become the model for decisions regarding the operations and management of the city. Yet, as Baudrillard theorized, such models risk being mistaken for the reality that they represent and the data set itself confusing the nature-culture divide and created hybrid geographies of the city. As a simulacrum that operates on its own underlying logic, the article argues that this version of seeing or visioning the world risks rendering it as an object of scrutiny for state and nonstate actors that override the realities and people of the city. Indeed, techno-visions and testing of AVs can lead to situations in which reality itself is manipulated to conforming with the simulation, further complicating the simulacra of the urban environments in which AV testing takes place.

AB This paper presents a motion-planning framework for urban autonomous driving at uncontrolled intersections. The intention and future state of the target vehicles are predicted using information obtained from the environment sensors. The target state prediction module employs an Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) filter to infer the intention of targets. The prediction results of each model of the IMM filter are fused to predict the future state of targets. The proposed predictor uses the intelligent driver model based-driver behavior model to construct the local filter of IMM. The driving mode decision is realized as a state machine consisting of two phases, 'Approach' and 'Risk Management'. The risk management phase is composed of two sub-modes, 'Cross' and 'Yield'. The state transition conditions between phases and modes are defined by introducing the concepts of 'Critical gap' and 'Follow-up gap'. Based on the determined driving mode, the motion planning module consists of two sub-modules for each phase. The required deceleration determination for the approach phase is proposed to consider the occluded region in order to prevent inevitable collisions caused by fast approaches. The model predictive controller for the risk management phase is designed to determine the desired acceleration to guarantee safety and prevent unnecessary deceleration simultaneously. Both computer simulation studies and vehicle tests are conducted to evaluate the proposed framework. The results indicate that the proposed framework ensures the safety at uncontrolled intersections with a driving pattern similar to that of a driver.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) promise to disrupt the traditional systems of transportation. An autonomous driving environment requires an uninterrupted, continuous stream of data and information based on complex traffic data sets and predictive measurements to make critical and real-time decisions in uncertain situations. Such an environment fosters a self-organizing system where vehicles must be seamlessly connected and various other services and intelligent decisions to manage traffic flow must be executed in an emergent manner. To proceed towards this vision, in this paper, we develop a traffic flow management model which is based on a novel two-phase approach for AVs to optimize traffic during congestion periods. In the first phase of our approach, we build an adaptive traffic signal control, using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to optimize traffic flow on road intersections during the periods when traffic is congested. In the second phase, we implement a Smart Re-routing (SR) technique for the traffic approaching intersections. Re-routing is used to carry out load-balancing of traffic to alternate paths to avoid congested road intersections. The experimental evaluation of the proposed approach is validated using simulations that demonstrate up to 31% improved performance efficiency compared to the traditional settings using pre-timed signals and without re-routing. The two-phase approach improves the overall traffic flow while reducing delays and minimizing long traffic queues' lengths. This approach is useful for making infrastructure intelligent enough to handle traffic congestion and balance traffic flow efficiently.

AB Perception system design is a vital step in the development of an autonomous vehicle (AV). With the vast selection of available off-the-shelf schemes and seemingly endless options of sensor systems implemented in research and commercial vehicles, it can be difficult to identify the optimal system for one's AV application. This article presents a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art AV perception technology available today. It provides up-to-date information about the advantages, disadvantages, limits, and ideal applications of specific AV sensors; the most prevalent sensors in current research and commercial AVs; autonomous features currently on the market; and localization and mapping methods currently implemented in AV research. This information is useful for newcomers to the AV field to gain a greater understanding of the current AV solution landscape and to guide experienced researchers towards research areas requiring further development. Furthermore, this paper highlights future research areas and draws conclusions about the most effective methods for AV perception and its effect on localization and mapping. Topics discussed in the Perception and Automotive Sensors section focus on the sensors themselves, whereas topics discussed in the Localization and Mapping section focus on how the vehicle perceives where it is on the road, providing context for the use of the automotive sensors. By improving on current state-of-the-art perception systems, AVs will become more robust, reliable, safe, and accessible, ultimately providing greater efficiency, mobility, and safety benefits to the public.

AB Urban air mobility (UAM), if successful, will disrupt urban transportation. UAM is not the first disruptive technology in transportation, with recent examples including electric ground vehicles (EVs), autonomous ground vehicles (AVs), and sharing services. In this paper, we conduct a meta analysis of about 800 articles in the UAM, EV, and AV areas that have been published from January 2015 to June 2020, and compare and contrast research thrusts in order to inform future UAM research. Alongside this effort, we conduct an in-depth review of articles related to demand modeling, operations, and integration with existing infrastructure. We use insights from the meta analysis and comprehensive review to inform future UAM research directions. Some of the potential research directions we identify include: (1) developing more refined demand models that incorporate the timing of when individuals will adopt UAM; (2) developing high-fidelity simulation models for UAM operations that capture interactions among vertiport locations, vertiport topology, demand, pricing, dispatching, and airspace restrictions; (3) explicitly considering oneway demand and parking constraints in demand and operational models; and (4) developing more realistic time-of-day energy profiles for UAM vehicles in order to assess whether the current electrical grid can support UAM operations.

AB This study proposes an autonomous platooning algorithm, composed of velocity, and path planning systems, of multiple ground vehicles in rough terrain. The velocity planning system aims to maintain desired distance between preceding and rear vehicles, and the path planning system generates reliable path to make the vehicles move safely under the given rough environment. To supply a reliable velocity command for the maintenance of the predefined distance, a disturbance observer (DOB)-based control method is employed. An uncertainty-free longitudinal kinematic model is first utilized for a nominal velocity generator and the DOB is added to the nominal velocity planner for handling various uncertainties generated during the autonomous platooning. On the other hand, the path planning method is developed by employing a passivity-based model predictive control method. With a derived passivity constraint, the stability of the platooning architecture, that is, the platooning performance, is improved. In addition, the proposed path planning method utilizes dynamic and kinematic models of the ground vehicle as equality constraints, and limited range of states and control input as inequality constraints, and perception result about the vehicle's own neighborhood is employed for generation of the path only in traversable region. Its solution is obtained using the particle swarm optimization method. Then, to follow the generated velocity and path commands, a well developed driving controller, commercially obtainable, is utilized. Finally, field tests are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

AB In the condition of actual obstacle avoidance, where longitudinal deceleration is large and variable, it is difficult for the autonomous vehicle to simultaneously track longitudinal velocity and lateral motion. In addition, when the planned trajectory exceeds the adhesion of the road, the vehicle is also prone to losing stability. Most studies of the obstacle avoidance process only consider constant velocity. This paper presents a novel control architecture for four-wheel driving (4WD) and four-wheel steering (4WS) autonomous vehicles to track predefined trajectory and velocity. It is proposed to use preview technology to obtain the desired state of the vehicle and a controller based on multi-input multi-output nonlinear model predictive control (MIMO-NMPC) that considers the deceleration-steering combination condition. According to the sensitivity analysis of the influence of tyre slip rate on tyre lateral force, the optimal working boundary of the tyre is determined. The output of the controller is constrained by estimating tyre force to prevent tyre force saturation and maximise tyre adhesion limit utilisation. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller can better track the trajectory and longitudinal velocity with a faster response on the high-adhesion road. The overshoot of lateral displacement and the maximum error of longitudinal velocity are less than 0.03m and 0.2m/s, respectively. In addition, when the planned trajectory exceeds the adhesion limit of the road, it can still follow the desired trajectory as closely as possible while maintaining stability on low-adhesion roads.

AB Sensing data plays a pivotal role in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), enabling CAV to perceive surroundings. For example, malicious applications might tamper this life-critical data, resulting in erroneous driving decisions and threatening the safety of passengers. Access control, one of the promising solutions to protect data from unauthorized access, is urgently needed for vehicle sensing data. However, due to the intrinsic complexity of vehicle sensing data, including historical and real time, and access patterns of different data sources, there is currently no suitable access control framework that can systematically solve this problem; current frameworks only focus on one aspect. In this article, we propose a novel and flexible access control framework, AC4AV, which aims to support various access control models, and provide APIs for dynamically adjusting access control models and developing customized access control models, thus supporting access control research on CAV for the community. In addition, we propose a data abstraction method to clearly identify data, applications, and access operations in CAV, and therefore is easily able to configure the permits of each data and application in access control policies. We have implemented a prototype to demonstrate our architecture on NATS for real-time data and NGINX for historical data, and three access control models as built-in models. We measured the performance of our AC4AV while applying these access control models to real-time and historical data. The experimental results show that the framework has little impact on real-time data access within a tolerable range.

AB APL has been engaged in a number of independent research and development projects over the past 5 years intended to demonstrate the cooperative behaviors of swarms of small, autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Swarm members cooperate to accomplish complex mission goals with no human in the loop. These projects represent a variety of approaches to UAV swarming, including teaming, consensus variables, and stigmergic potential fields. A series of experiments was conducted from 2001 through 2005 to demonstrate these concepts, and research in this area is ongoing. As a result of these efforts, APL has developed autonomy frameworks, hardware architectures, and communications concepts that are applicable across a broad range of small, autonomous aerial vehicles.

AB This paper proposes a robust gain-scheduling lateral motion control strategy via coordination of the active front-wheel steering (AFS) and direct yaw moment control (DYC) for path following of autonomous vehicle. Distinguishing from other relevant researches, a seamless application of the DYC is designed to reduce the influence of braking for the vehicle longitudinal dynamics. In order to achieve this objective, the weighting function with a self-scheduling parameter is designed. Based on the above, a novel LPV (Linear Parameter Varying) synthesis H(infinity )performances lateral motion controller is designed considering the vehicle longitudinal velocity as a time-varying parameter. The path following is realised through achieving a desired yaw rate, which is generated based on the path-following dynamics. The feedback gains can be derived by solving the LMI (Linear Matrix Inequalities). Furthermore, the physical limitations of the actuators (steer-by wire and brake-by-wire) are considered by weighting functions. Finally, experiments in the HIL system are carried out to verify the effectiveness and real-time performance of the proposed control strategy, and the results show that the proposed controller has good tracking capability under different manoeuvres and can reduce the possibility of actuator saturation and the influence of braking for the vehicle longitudinal dynamics.

AB This paper addresses the problem of platooning control for a fleet of sailboats. A quadrilateral path is proposed to avoid going into the wind. A tack strategy is defined to go front the wind, stay in a short corridor and regulate the sailboat acceleration, which is a challenging task in comparison to autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) or surface vehicles that can use motors for such regulation. Desired acceleration which guarantees to reach the platooning has been derived and validated. A method of regulating the sail angle using a proportional command is proposed to control the sailboat acceleration. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Vehicle automation, along with vehicle electrification and shared mobility, may transform the existing transportation if they are handled properly. However, they may create unintended consequences if the current market dominance of fossil fuel and privately-owned vehicles persists, and travel patterns and transportation policies remain unchanged. The extent of these potential benefits and unintended consequences depends on the expected AV adoption process, people's preferred vehicle powertrain, and AV-related policy and infrastructural support. This paper seeks to understand the impacts of attitudinal factors and roadway designs on people's intention to use AVs and to purchase battery-electric AVs (EAVs) and gasoline-powered AVs (GAVs) under travel and user heterogeneity. Fourteen latent attitudinal factors related to the perceptions and attitudes towards AV and EV technologies, driving, the environment, and personal innovativeness were considered. An EAV-enabled urban design environments were created, featuring dedicated AV lanes, wireless charging for EAVs, and AV pick-up/drop-off zones. Using a stated preference survey data of over 1300 responses in the U.S., Multiple Indicators and Multiple Causes models are estimated to understand the relationship among various latent variables and capture heterogeneities within the population based on their sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics. The model estimation results show that the respondents' perception of AVs and EAVs advantages, road safety improvement potential, compatibility with their lifestyles and travel needs, and their attitudes towards driving are key factors of their intention to use AVs and purchase EAVs. Furthermore, some segments of the population based on their sociodemographic and travel behavior characteristics are more likely to have a higher intention to use AVs and buy EAVs. The model estimation results and study insights can be used by policymakers to develop

AB Accurate and reliable trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous vehicles to achieve safe and efficient operation. Vehicles perceive the historical trajectories of moving objects and make predictions of behavioral intentions for a future period of time. With the predicted trajectories of moving objects such as obstacle vehicles, pedestrians, and non-motorized vehicles as inputs, self-driving vehicles can make more rational driving decisions and plan more reasonable and safe vehicle motion behaviors. However, due to traffic environments such as intersection scenes with highly interdependent and dynamic attributes, the task of motion anticipation becomes challenging. Existing works focus on the mutual relationships among vehicles while ignoring other potential essential interactions such as vehicle-traffic rules. These studies have not yet deeply explored the intensive learning of interactions between multi-agents, which may result in evaluation deviations. Aiming to meet these issues, we have designed a novel framework, namely trajectory prediction with attention-based spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks (TPASTGCN). In our proposal, the multi-agent interaction mechanisms, including vehicle-vehicle and vehicle-traffic rules, are meticulously highlighted and integrated into one homogeneous graph by transferring the time-series data of traffic lights into the spatial-temporal domains. Through integrating the attention mechanism into the adjacency matrix, we effectively learn the different strengths of interactive association and improve the model's ability to capture critical features. Simultaneously, we construct a hierarchical structure employing the spatial GCN and temporal GCN to extract the spatial dependencies of traffic networks. Profiting from the gated recurrent unit (GRU), the scene context in temporal dimensions is further attained and enhanced with the encoder. In such a way, the GCN and GRU networks are fused as a features extractor module in the proposed framework. Finally, the future potential trajectories generation tasks are performed by another GRU network. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the scheme compared with several baselines.

AB Automation of complicated underwater tasks require acoustic image based object recognition. This paper presents an acoustic image based real-time object recognition system. We proposed an acoustic image predictor to estimate an object's shape in advance. Depending on the acoustic camera's position, the predictor generates optimal template for recognition. The proposed method is implemented in our autonomous marine vehicle. For real-time processing, efficient recognition strategies are addressed. The vehicle detects an object and localizes it for recognition. In the detection process, the acoustic image's specific characteristics are used as the detection cues. In the localization process, the vehicle's horizontal and vertical positioning strategies are described. Efficient template generation method to minimize computing power is addressed. This realizes real-time recognition using the vehicle. To estimate the proposed system's accuracy and reliability, a recognition test was carried out in the field. The vehicle successfully recognized two different objects with high accuracy. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Driverless vehicles are expected to revolutionize existing transportation systems by improving safety, mobility, and sustainability. This study provides a framework that incorporates autonomous vehicles (AVs) into the transportation demand analysis and planning process of regional areas. To this end, we apply a nested logit model based on the probability distributions of the trip destination and mode choice, and formulate a multiclass traffic assignment to differentiate between AV and HV modes of transport. The proposed model is implemented in a conventional 4-step model developed for the state of Victoria, Australia. We study two different future scenarios in the year 2051 using various parameters including the value of travel time, vehicle operating cost, and toll rates to evaluate the impacts of different assumptions of AVs on Victoria's future mobility. Our results show that travelers prefer to traverse longer distances with little to no difference in their associated general travel costs. This indicates that AVs provide users with more flexible residential, work, and school location choices. Choosing AVs for long distances rather than short distances is another finding of this study. Furthermore, as a result of the AVs deployment, up to 10% of new trips from public transport and active modes will be shifted to car trips. Empty vehicle travels by AV add around 20 percent to the vehicle kilometers traveled on Victoria's roadway network which leads to a major reduction in the average speed and an increase in travel time delay.

AB In highway scenarios, an alert human driver will typically anticipate early cut-in/cut-out maneuvers of surrounding vehicles using visual cues mainly. Autonomous vehicles must anticipate these situations at an early stage too, to increase their safety and efficiency. In this work, lane-change recognition and prediction tasks are posed as video action recognition problems. Up to four different two-stream-based approaches, that have been successfully applied to address human action recognition, are adapted here by stacking visual cues from forward-looking video cameras to recognize and anticipate lane-changes of target vehicles. We study the influence of context and observation horizons on performance, and different prediction horizons are analyzed. The different models are trained and evaluated using the PREVENTION dataset. The obtained results clearly demonstrate the potential of these methodologies to serve as robust predictors of future lane-changes of surrounding vehicles proving an accuracy higher than 90% in time horizons of between 1-2 seconds.

AB This paper describes a method of considering the slip that is experienced by the wheels of an agricultural autonomous guided vehicle such that the accuracy of dead-reckoning navigation may be improved. Traction models for off-road locomotion are reviewed. Using experimental data from an agricultural AGV, a simplified form suitable for vehicle navigation is derived. This simplified model relates measurements of the torques applied to the wheels with wheel slip, and is used as the basis of an observation model for odometric sensor data in the vehicle's extended Kalman filter (EKF) navigation system. The slip model parameters are included as states in the vehicle EKF so that the vehicle may adapt to changing surface properties. Results using real field data and a simulation of the vehicle EKF show that positional accuracy can be increased by a slip-aware odometric model, and that when used as part of a multi-sensor navigation system, the consistency of the EKF state estimator is improved.

AB External disturbances, parameter perturbance, data delay and control lag provoke significant model mismatches. If not properly compensated, they can greatly deteriorate the control performance of autonomous vehicle, such as reduction of tracking accuracy or even loss of stability in extreme. However, existing approaches barely consider these uncertainties together. In the light of this, an adaptive strategy is presented for trajectory tracking control of autonomous vehicle to simultaneously cope with aforementioned factors. First of all, given the dynamic or kinematic characteristics among path, vehicle and steering actuator, an integrated dynamic model is constructed. To handle the control lag of the steering actuator, a first-order model is utilized to approximate the dynamics of the steering subsystem, which is then integrated into the vehicle dynamics to reformulate the tracking model as a lag-free one. Then, the hierarchical robust tracking controller is proposed to acquire reliable control commands. To prevent the system breakdown in the presence of data delay, the delay-dependent criterion is designed via linear parameter varying technique and integral inequality approach. Moreover, the controllers also consider both the H infinity index and the guaranteed cost one to guarantee the effectiveness and robustness of tracking commands. Subsequently, to enhance the adaptability of algorithm, a feedback gains scheduling mechanism is proposed to adaptively tune tracking commands among different robust gains leveraging the phase plane approach. Finally, several comparative cases are conducted in the hardware-in-the-loop platform to verify that proposed strategy has better capability on trajectory tracking in uncertain driving conditions.

AB A model of a smart road network consisting of unsignalised intersections and smart roads connecting them is considered in this work with the aim of presenting a traffic management system for self-driving cars (or, more generally, autonomous vehicles) which travel the network. The proposed system repeatedly solves a set of mathematical programming problems (each of them relative to a single intersection or to a single road stretch of the network) within a decentralised control scheme in which each local intersection controller and each local road controller communicates with the fully autonomous vehicles in order to receive travel data from vehicles and to provide speed profiles to them once determined the optimal solution of the problem. In order to reduce the computational effort required to provide the optimal solution, a discrete-time approach is adopted so that, in each time interval, a limited number of vehicles are taken into consideration; in this way, solutions can be determined in a very short time thus making the proposed model compatible with a practical application to real traffic systems. The proposed model is general enough, and can be adapted to different scenarios of smart road networks reserved for self-driving cars.

AB Environment analysis of automatic vehicles needs the detection from 3-D point cloud information. This paper addresses this task when only partial scanning data are available. Our method develops the detection capabilities of autonomous vehicles equipped with 3-D range sensors for navigation purposes. In industrial practice, the safety scanners of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and a localization technology provide an additional possibility to gain 3-D point clouds from planar contour points or low vertical resolution. Based on this data and a suitable evaluation algorithm, intelligence of vehicles can be significantly increased without the need for installation of additional sensors. In this paper, we propose a solution for an obstacle categorization problem for partial point clouds without shape modeling. The approach is tested for a known database, as well as for real-life scenarios. In case of AGVs, real-time run is provided by on-board computers of usual complexity.

However, the dynamic nature of transport networks presents a significant challenge when ensuring their efficient operation. The use of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) has been proposed to tackle this challenge. However, establishing efficient communication and optimizing dynamic paths with charging selection remain complex problems. In this paper, we propose a joint push-pull communication mode to obtain real-time traffic conditions and charging infrastructure information (i.e., charging stations and energy segments). We also analyze the selection of relay vehicles in multi-hop communication routing, considering factors such as link stability, vehicle distance, and reputation values. Furthermore, we formulate a dynamic optimization problem based on real-time information to minimize travel and charging costs. Our proposed algorithm enables AEVs to obtain charging services from charging stations and conduct dynamic wireless charging via energy segments. We present a dynamic real-time A* algorithm to solve the path-optimization problem and a dynamic real-time charging selection algorithm based on dynamic path optimization when the state of charge is lower than the charging threshold. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed joint push-pull communication mode can provide vehicles the up-to-date information and the developed optimization algorithms effectively reduce travel and charging costs.

AB The paper reports on a practical backward motion strategy for a vehicle pushing several passive trailers with any combination of on- and off-axle hitches. The last trailer is defined as a virtual tractor that can be guided along paths of varying curvature like a single non-holonomic vehicle. Then, kinematic relationships are proposed to translate the resulting motion commands to the actual tractor. The paper extends previous work by specifically addressing propagation of virtual set-points through on-axle hitches. This case is difficult because direct propagation cannot be achieved due to kinematic restrictions imposed by current joint angles. The method has been experimentally applied for both autonomous path-tracking and online operator steering using a tracked mobile robot with two different off- and on-axle combinations of dissimilar trailers. Results indicate applicability in autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems.

AB This paper presents a hybrid agent of behaviour architecture to deal with the autonomous navigation of a farming vehicle. To this end, a conventional vehicle was fitted with a set of sensors and actuators to acquire continuous location and environmental data to safely and appropriately interact with a dynamic environment. The vehicle autonomously performs local piloting, following a tentative path initially specified by the human operator through a set of intermediate positions. A wireless LAN is used to get a bi-directional communication between the farming vehicle and the human supervisor. Sensor-fusion algorithms are proposed to overcome the lack of GPS signals so as to obtain continuous and precise positioning. From a set of basic motion agents ADVANCE, TURN, STOP, AVOID OBSTACLE, more specific agents related to the agricultural operation are defined, such as FOLLOW STRAIGHT LINE and CHANGE OF ROW Some results are presented to show global navigation.

AB This paper presents a co-operative, self-organisation method for Multi-ple Autonomous Vehicles aiming to share surveillance responsibilities. Spatial organization or formation configuration of multiple vehicles/agents? systems is crucial for a team of agents to achieve their mission objectives. In this paper we present simple yet efficient thermodynamic inspired formation control frame-work. The proposed method autonomously allocates region of surveillance to each vehicle and also re-adjusts the area of their responsibilities during the mis-sion. It provides framework for heterogeneous UAVs to scatter themselves opti-mally in order to provide maximum coverage of a given area. The method is inspired from a natural phenomenon of thermodynamics and presents a flexible and efficient mechanism for co-operative team formation. The idea here is to model the system as a collection of heat generating bodies and to maintain the con-stant system temperature across the system by introducing appropriate separation among vehicles. We also present the behavour of the algorithm with the communica-tion constraint. The proposed method achieves special allocation objectives, even with constraint communication. It is further shown that the method can easily be adopted to arbitrary configurations according to mission requirements and team configuration. This co-operative decision making of allocating mission responsibil-ities by self-organising a team of vehicles adds to the overall autonomy of the Multi-vehicular system.

AB Advanced driver-assistance systems have recently become one of the most active topics related to intelligent vehicles. Such assistance facilitates vehicular operation by allowing drivers increased control and an enhanced driving experience, and it even comes in the form of automated assistance for autonomous vehicle operation. This paper presents a driver-assistance system that uses a low-cost embedded digital signal processor, with the overall system installed in a commercial vehicle. Based on driving information supplied by multiple sensors, such as a real-time vision system, a vehicle-to-vehicle communication system, and in-vehicle sensors, the proposed system can facilitate decision making and the performing of driving tasks while executing overtaking maneuvers. This paper developed a data fusion stage based on a collision warning algorithm in which the overtaken vehicle and other vehicles in the neighboring lane are accounted for to avoid collisions. The system employs fuzzy control in the steering and speed automation to emulate the driving tasks performed by humans. The applicability of the proposed system was examined in a real-road environment, and a set of experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of using the involved coordination strategies while conducting various driving maneuvers.

AB In this work the navigation and GPS based trajectory control of an unmanned autonomous vehicle is introduced. The caterpillar tread like mobile vehicle with duo cycle drive is equipped with a mobile GPS and micro controller. To get accurate position data, a DGPS (Differential GPS) with a local base station is used. In order to let the vehicle to follow a desired trajectory, a reference path is given by using Way Points as GPS data's to micro controller, which provide the position and orientation control of the vehicle. The instant position and orientation of the vehicle in accordance to an assigned plane coordinate frame are calculated by micro controller from detected latitude and longitude values (land coordinates) of mobile GPS, which receive corrected on line data's from base station. The duo cycle vehicle is driven with geared DC motors, which are equipped with chained caterpillar tread drives, so that it can have better motion, clambering and tracking performances. Successful navigation and path following results are obtained with several experiments by various control applications.

AB This paper addresses the problem of distributed state estimation in formations of vehicles with time-varying measurement topology. One or more vehicles have access to measurements of their own state, while the rest must rely on measurements relative to other vehicles in the vicinity and limited communication to estimate their own state, and it is assumed that the vehicles may gain or lose access to some measurements over time. The proposed solution consists in the implementation of a local state observer on-board each vehicle, and the effects of changes in the measurement topology on the estimation error dynamics are studied resorting to switched systems theory. Sufficient conditions for exponential stability of the global estimation error dynamics are presented for two different switching laws. The results are applied to the practical case of a formation of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), and simulation results are presented that validate the proposed solution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Technical and legal challenges cause the implementation of Autonomous Driving in road traffic to still be a long way off. However, the introduction of driver assistance functions enables cars' automation for low speeds already nowadays. The concept of Autonomous Transport (AT) combines automated driving with Automated Guided Vehicle's technology. In this paper, we assess risks that emanate from AT and show fields of action for its implementation with respect to the standards for functional safety. We set up requirements for the reliability of cars' electric power supply, actuators and sensors. Concepts for their cost-efficient fulfillment are derived. The realization of collision avoidance and navigation without additional attachments is discussed.

AB This article reviews R&D activities on automated highway systems (AHSs) since 1950s with emphasis on recent ones. AHSs in the 1950s and 1960s were featured by a cooperative system between roads and vehicles; those in the 1970s and 1980s were by autonomous systems. Intelligent transport system (ITS) projects since 1980s regarded AHS as an important system, not only a single automated vehicle but also an automated platoon were developed. In recent years, the R&D focuses on automated transit buses aiming at precision docking and driving along a narrow lane and automated truck platoons aiming at energy saving. The automated driving can be common ground of automobiles and robots.

AB Coupled controllers are vital for safely handling vehicles, especially in critical driving situations that include changing lanes to avoid obstacles. Controllers specialized in emergencies must keep road users safe in critical situations. In this paper, we develop the coupled controller to handle evasive maneuvers for an over-actuated vehicle. The controller is based on the second-order sliding mode control theory. We use the bicycle model to establish the equivalent and robust steering equations as a control-oriented model. The lateral and longitudinal vehicle motions are coupled to each other by the lateral vehicle information on the longitudinal sliding surface, and the dependence of the lateral sliding surface on the longitudinal velocity. The torque vectoring method based on fuzzy logic adjusts the yaw moment. We address the tire slip circle on the slip controller to stabilize the vehicle while maneuvering. We simulate and evaluate our controller in a rear-end collision situation with a short time window to maneuver the vehicle. The ego vehicle detects the preceding vehicle and performs an evasive lane change while simultaneously applying brakes to bring the vehicle to a halt. Our research is the earliest in providing an ultimate emergency control to successfully avoid crashes up to 130 km/h in short time crash detection.

AB Human-machine collaborative (HMC) torque control allows the drivers to participate in driving and cooperate to complete driving tasks. However, the driver's torque input and unknown disturbances encountered by the vehicle will adversely affect the control of autonomous vehicles. The problems of ''explosion of complexity" appear when the adaptive backstepping method is used to design the steering control strategy. To solve the above problems, a steering control strategy based on command filter adaptive torque control is proposed. Firstly, in order to describe the dynamic response of the vehicle and the maneuvering behavior of the driver, a human-vehicle-road model with steering torque as input is established. Then, command filtering adaptive control (CFAC) is used to design the steering control strategy of HMC, and Lyapunov theory is used to analyze the stability of the control system. To reduce the uncertainty range of the system and guarantee stability under disturbances, the unknown steering load boundary and driver's torque input are estimated. Finally, simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed steering control strategy based on torque control. The experimental results show that the path tracking error converges to zero rapidly even when the HMC driving encounters disturbances.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AV) are poised to induce disruptive changes, with significant implications for the economy, the environment, and society. This article reviews prior research on AVs and society, and articulates future needs. Research to assess future societal change induced by AVs has grown dramatically in recent years. The critical challenge in assessing the societal implications of AVs is forecasting how consumers and businesses will use them. Researchers are predicting the future use of AVs by consumers through stated preference surveys, finding analogs in current behaviors, utility optimization models, and/or staging empirical "AV-equivalent" experiments. While progress is being made, it is important to recognize that potential behavioral change induced by AVs is massive in scope and that forecasts are difficult to validate. For example, AVs could result in many consumers abandoning private vehicles for ride-share services, vastly increased travel by minors, the elderly and other groups unable to drive, and/or increased recreation and commute miles driven due to increased utility of in-vehicle time. We argue that significantly increased efforts are needed from the AVs and society research community to ensure 1) the important behavioral changes are analyzed and 2) models are explicitly evaluated to characterize and reduce uncertainty.

AB This paper presents the design and first test on a simulator of a vehicle trajectory-planning algorithm that adapts to traffic on a lane-structured infrastructure such as highways. The proposed algorithm is designed to run on a fail-safe embedded environment with low computational power, such as an engine control unit, to be implementable in commercial vehicles of the near future. The target platform has a clock frequency of less than 150 MHz, 150 kB RAM of memory, and a 3-MB program memory. The trajectory planning is performed by a two-step algorithm. The first step defines the feasible maneuvers with respect to the environment, aiming at minimizing the risk of a collision. The output of this step is a target group of maneuvers in the longitudinal direction (accelerating or decelerating), in the lateral direction (changing lanes), and in the combination of both directions. The second step is a more detailed evaluation of several possible trajectories within these maneuvers. The trajectories are optimized to additional performance indicators such as travel time, traffic rules, consumption, and comfort. The output of this module is a trajectory in the vehicle frame that represents the recommended vehicle state (position, heading, speed, and acceleration) for the following seconds.

AB We present a smooth nonlinear time-varying formation-tracking controller for autonomous vehicles modeled as a nonholonomic unicycle. Our first result consists of a leader-follower tracking controller that guarantees uniform global asymptotic stability under the standing assumption that either the rotational or the translational reference velocity is persistently exciting. Then, we extend this result to the case of formation control of a swarm of vehicles. We show that this problem may be solved via decentralized tracking control, under the assumption that each robot communicates with one leader and one follower.

AB Navigation is a critical requirement for the operation of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). To estimate the vehicle position, we present an algorithm using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to integrate dead-reckoning position with acoustic ranges from multiple beacons pre-deployed in the operating environment. Owing to high latency, variable sound speed multipath transmissions and unreliability in acoustic measurements, outlier recognition techniques are proposed as well. The navigation algorithm has been tested by the recorded data of deep sea AUV during field operations in a variety of environments. Our results show the improved performance over prior techniques based on position computation.

AB This paper addresses the problem of trajectory tracking control for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in 3 dimensions space. Given a smooth, inertial, 3D reference trajectory, in order to make the position error to stay in the neighborhood of zero, the control algorithm uses vehicle's kinematic equation and linear system stability theory to compute the desired body-fixed velocities. Using these methods, the velocity error dynamics are obtained. Backstepping techniques are used, forcing the tracking error to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero. Simulation of a spiral trajectory is performed. The result shows that the controller can realize 3 dimensions trajectory tracking effectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The development of vehicle technologies such as connected and autonomous vehicle environments provide drivers with functions for convenience and safety that are highly capable of remote vehicle diagnosis or lane-keeping assistance. Unfortunately, despite impressive advantages for drivers, these functions also have various vulnerabilities that could lead to cyber-physical attacks on automotive Controller Area Networks (i.e., automotive CAN). To deal with these security issues, a multitude of issue-specific countermeasures have already been proposed. In this paper, we introduce existing research on automotive CAN attacks and evaluate several state-of-the-art countermeasures. Particularly, we provide a comprehensive adversary model for automotive CAN and classify existing countermeasures into four system categories: (1) preventative protection, (2) intrusion detection, (3) authentication, and (4) post-protection. From the extensive literature review, we attempt to summarize the security research regarding automotive CAN and identify open research directions for in-vehicle networks of autonomous vehicle.

AB As the intelligent vehicle concept accelerated with electric vehicles, and then interest in autonomous vehicle technologies increased, investments on unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) studies also accelerated. Unmanned ground vehicles, despite their complex structure and technology, bring many advantages with their use. The most important advantages of UGVs are that they do not have human-specific features (sleepiness, fatigue, anger, etc.), react faster, and reach a decision by calculating possibilities according to the conditions. In this study, a UGV has been developed, which has the ability to navigate to a self-determined or unknown area, ability of mapping, localization, trajectory detection and tracking, detection of obstacles and finding a new path to avoid collisions with these obstacles. In an area without a specific map, skecth or floor plan, UGV's autonomous driving capability in indoor and outdoor, has been verified by the experiments. The phases, problems, solution techniques and results required for UGV design are presented with a systematic approach in this study.

AB A path planning and tracking framework is presented to maintain a collision-free path for autonomous vehicles. For path-planning approaches, a 3-D virtual dangerous potential field is constructed as a superposition of trigonometric functions of the road and the exponential function of obstacles, which can generate a desired trajectory for collision avoidance when a vehicle collision with obstacles is likely to happen. Next, to track the planned trajectory for collision avoidance maneuvers, the path-tracking controller formulated the tracking task as a multiconstrained model predictive control (MMPC) problem and calculated the front steering angle to prevent the vehicle from colliding with a moving obstacle vehicle. Simulink and CarSim simulations are conducted in the case where moving obstacles exist. The simulation results show that the proposed path-planning approach is effective for many driving scenarios, and the MMPC-based path-tracking controller provides dynamic tracking performance and maintains good maneuverability.

AB Urban expressway network has become essential for over 30% of road trips in urban areas, making them significant in shaping environmental sustainability. Recently connected-and-autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology is expected to significantly transform the urban expressway systems, but little attention has been attributed to quantitatively assessing the impacts of managing CAV in mixed traffic flow on urban expressway environmental sustainability. To address this research gap, this study proposes a comprehensive simulation-optimization framework. The simulation component involves multiclass cell transmission model that simulates and evaluates the traffic flow of mixed human-driven vehicles and CAVs on the expressway, whereas the optimization component proposes a novel management strategy that jointly considers the dedicated lanes and speed management. An analytical tool is developed and validated in North-South Elevated Expressway in Shanghai, China, and further investigated the sensitivity of environmental impacts to vehicle headway, travel demand, and CAV market penetration rate. The results indicate that use of the proposed tool can reduce the total fuel consumption and exhaust emissions compared to baseline scenario. Overall, the insights from this study are valuable for policymakers of transportation in future cities, who develop management strategies on urban expressways that enhance the potential impact of CAVs on environmental sustainability.

ID GENERATION
AB Lane information plays an important role in high-definition (HD) maps because it provides invaluable road information for autonomous vehicles. The most widely used lane extraction method for HD maps is based on mobile mapping systems, and it is prohibitively costly and time-consuming. In this study, we propose a novel approach for lane information extraction based on crowdsourcing vehicles equipped with monocular cameras and global navigation satellite system devices for recording road images and position data. First, we propose a lane mask propagation network to detect the lane markings in images, which are then projected from a perspective space into a three-dimensional space in accordance with the position data. Second, we propose a data management method to store lane information in the cloud data center. An improved density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise clustering algorithm and a gradual fitting algorithm are used to remove the outliers and improve the lane data accuracy. The proposed method is quantitatively evaluated against a real-world HD map produced by a mobile mapping vehicle. The experimental results show that more than 80% of the extracted lane markings meet the accuracy requirements of HD maps. In conclusion, our method can be used as a low-cost and efficient approach for updating the lane information in HD maps for autonomous vehicles.

ID OPTIMIZATION; SUSPENSION; VIBRATION
AB When autonomous vehicles pass through uneven roads, especially the consecutive speed control humps (SCHs) on expressways, the speed of them will have a significant influence on the safety and comfort of driving. How to automatically select the most appropriate speed has become a practical research subject. This paper studies the nonlinear vibration process of the suspension system when the autonomous vehicle passes through the SCHs on a highway. Firstly, the paper establishes a four-degree-of-freedom (4-DOF) nonlinear half-vehicle model and a stimulation function of trapezoidal SCHs and then uses the Runge-Kutta method to numerically solve the differential equations of motion of the suspension system. In the next part, the paper chooses the genetic algorithm to build a multi-objective optimization problem model, which selects the vertical displacement of the vehicle body, the suspension's dynamic deflection and the dynamic load of the tire as optimization objectives and combines the method of the unified objective function to find the optimal passing speed. Finally, the paper designs and carries out the solution process of the multi-objective optimization problem for the vehicle under three scenarios, conventional passive suspension, semi-active suspension, active suspension, and compares the optimized state with the pre-optimized state to prove the effectiveness of the optimization model.

AB As an important part of a smart city, the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is the key to the sustainable development of urban transportation considering the fuel consumption as well as traffic efficiency. Smart sensor can be integrated with the transportation infrastructure to achieve a sustainable ITS. Recent advancements in ITS suggest that the roads will gradually be filled with autonomous vehicles that are able to drive themselves while cooperating with each other to form the sustainable transportation systems. As a representative driving pattern of autonomous vehicles, the platooning technology has great potential to lower fuel consumption and increase traffic efficiency. In this paper, to reach above goals, we present a systematic framework for vehicular platooning forming. Firstly, the optimal speed of a platoon is determined by the optimal speed model, by which the total fuel consumption of this platoon could be saved to a great extend. After that, an optimal insert point decision is made for the vehicles to be grouped in the platoon, based on proposed Q-learning model. We also design a collision detection model to reduce the collision probability when a vehicle intents to join a platoon. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed model could significantly improve the traffic efficiency, reduce the fuel consumption and decrease the platooning forming time, compared with other classic algorithms.

The estimation process is based on the viewpoint augmented navigation (VAN) framework using an extended information filter. Cholesky factorization modifications are used to maintain a factor of the VAN information matrix, enabling efficient recovery of state estimates and covariances. The algorithm is demonstrated using data acquired by an autonomous underwater vehicle performing a visual survey of sponge beds. Loop-closure observations produced by a stereo vision system are used to correct the estimated vehicle trajectory produced by dead reckoning sensors.

AB Vehicle-integrated motion control (IMC) with the capability to enhance the overall performance by considering the couplings and interactions among various subsystems is an active and open issue. This article proposes a novel finite-time lateral and longitudinal IMC scheme to bypass the resulting complex nonlinearities on the basis of time-delay estimation (TDE). The precise tracking of reference trajectory is achieved where the transient errors are limited to the designed prescribed performance functions (PPFs). The expected steady-state region can be entered in a fixed time, and then the state errors convergence to zero asymptotically. Meanwhile, actuator faults and external disturbance, for autonomous vehicles (AVs) equipped with abundant actuators, are frequently encountered in practice. The presented controller incorporating fault-tolerant ability and disturbance rejection is implemented to further optimize the robustness and reliability. In particular, no auxiliary approximate mechanism or additional prior knowledge is needed. The simulation results for standard maneuvers and planned trajectory tracking are conducted to demonstrate the benefits of the constructed integrated control scheme, in terms of tracking performance (position tracking error dropped over 70%), handling (yaw rate tracing error dropped over 10%), and stability (vehicle sideslip angle dropped over 70%).

AB Determination of braking efficiency in heavy vehicles is not a trivial issue. Following the entry into force of Directive 2010/48/EU, and with this ISO-21069, Spanish Periodic Technical Inspection sector has had to tackle difficulties. Developing procedures to inspect vehicles in fully laden condition, with methods of pressure measurement or with equivalent methods have been the main difficulties. This paper explains briefly methods proposed by ISO-21069 and methods used in Spain. Then, Spanish inspection results on heavy vehicles are statistically analysed, including the autonomous community in which fBRAKE is in use, in order to compare results against each other. This analysis takes into account percentage of braking deficiencies detected in periodic technical inspection on each autonomous community. Finally, a new model for fBRAKE alternative method is presented in this paper in order to obtain more accurate results during inspection using this method.

ID BURIED TARGETS; AUV; IDENTIFICATION; SHELL
AB One of the long term goals of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) minehunting is to have multiple inexpensive AUVs in a harbor autonomously classify hazards. Existing acoustic methods for target classification using AUV-based sensing, such as sidescan and synthetic aperture sonar, require an expensive payload on each outfitted vehicle and post-processing and/or image interpretation. A vehicle payload and machine learning classification methodology using bistatic angle dependence of target scattering amplitudes between a fixed acoustic source and target has been developed for onboard, fully autonomous classification with lower cost-per-vehicle. To achieve the high-quality, densely sampled three-dimensional (3D) bistatic scattering data required by this research, vehicle sampling behaviors and an acoustic payload for precision timed data acquisition with a 16 element nose array were demonstrated. 3D bistatic scattered field data were collected by an AUV around spherical and cylindrical targets insonified by a 7-9 kHz fixed source. The collected data were compared to simulated scattering models. Classification and confidence estimation were shown for the sphere versus cylinder case on the resulting real and simulated bistatic amplitude data. The final models were used for classification of simulated targets in real time in the LAMSS MOOS-IvP simulation package [M. Benjamin, H. Schmidt, P. Newman, and J. Leonard, J. Field Rob. 27, 834-875 (2010)]. (C) 2015 Acoustical Society of America.

DE Autonomous vehicle decision; mandatory lane change; collision-risk

AB In order to make safe and reasonable decisions in some high-risk environments such as the mandatory lane change, we propose an IMM-based partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) decision algorithm using the collision-risk function which combines the time-to-collision (TTC), the intervehicular time (IT), and the collision function for mandatory lane change. The newly proposed collision-risk function contains two parts: the vehicle impact factor and the collision function, which is used to assess the risk and determines whether the autonomous vehicle collides with surrounding vehicles. The IMM-base POMDP is used for decision-making and we apply the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to solve the problem. In the decision-making process, the belief state is obtained by the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) algorithm. With the collision-risk function and the probability distribution of the states of surrounding vehicles in the future, the proposed POMDP decision algorithm can determine whether the autonomous vehicle accelerates lane changing or decelerates lane changing, and obtain the acceleration corresponding to each path point. Finally, in order to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, we perform a driver-in-the-loop simulation through Prescan. We use aggressive driver and conservative driver to control the rear vehicle of the target lane, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can accurately predict the accelerations of surrounding vehicles and make safe and reasonable decisions under two scenarios, which is superior to the general POMDP.

AB Application of nutrients, fungicides, and pesticides is one of the most important processes in agricultural production and can have a significant impact on yield, quality, and ultimately profitability. However, fungicide and pesticide application can create significant environmental and human safety concerns. The motivations behind the development of an autonomous vehicle for greenhouse sprayer applications are to improve chemical delivery, reduce labor requirements, and minimize labor hazards. This research focuses on the development of a prototype vehicle platform that can be used in greenhouse sprayer applications. A six-wheel differential steering vehicle was designed and built to act as a greenhouse sprayer. Power was transmitted from two independent DC drives to the wheels through chain and sprocket transmission. A fuzzy logic-based proportional-derivative controller was developed to navigate the vehicle through simulated greenhouse aisles using range information provided by ultrasonic sensors. The vehicle was tested on sand and concrete surfaces using two modes of operation. In self-contained mode, the vehicle carried a self-contained spraying system, while in trailer mode, the spraying system was mounted on a pull-behind trailer that was towed down the aisle. Results show that the self-contained mode performed better than the trailer mode on both sand and concrete. There was an average RMS path error less than 2.5 cm for an aisle width of 61 cm and an instantaneous average error less than 6.4 mm. The robotic sprayer successfully navigated 45.7 cm, 50.8 cm, and 61.0 cm aisle widths.

AB We consider encrypted guidance systems for straight-line path following. With cloud-computing technology, we can outsource computations in guidance systems to third-party providers, increasing scalability and enabling guidance-as-a-service. However, by remotely hosting a conventional guidance system on third-party infrastructure, we leak information such as the path of the vehicle. Potential customers may consider these leaks a serious breach of confidentiality, which limits the practical use of such systems. Therefore, to make cloud-based guidance systems viable, we would like to design guidance systems that we can host remotely without revealing confidential information to the host. To this end, we show that we can construct guidance systems that operate on encrypted position measurements, encrypted waypoints, and the bearing between each waypoint by using homomorphic encryption, effectively preventing the cloud host from identifying the vehicle's position. We show that the proposed guidance laws are locally exponentially stable and that the induced computational latency is appropriate for the real-time guidance of autonomous vehicles. Through field experiments, we demonstrate that an encrypted guidance system is practical and allows an unmanned surface vehicle to follow an encrypted path. The originality of this work lies in conceptualizing, designing, and experimentally validating an encrypted guidance system, unlike other studies that considered encrypted control systems.

AB Vehicle bounding box tracking (VBBT) is a new problem that is becoming increasingly important in autonomous driving. It is defined as a problem in which not only the position but also the size of a target vehicle is estimated using a sensor. In this paper, novel VBBT using a low-end three-dimensional (3D) laser scanner is proposed. Compared to previous methods, the proposed VBBT has three distinctions: (1) the center of a rectangular vehicle is defined as its position, and the motion model that uses the center of the vehicle as the state is developed; (2) a new measurement model is proposed that models the measured size of the target vehicle as a sample from a uniform distribution; and (3) a Bayesian filter for the proposed motion and measurement model is developed and it is named as the Pareto Kalman filter (PKF). Finally, the proposed method is applied to six scenarios, and its validity is demonstrated through experimentation.

DT Review
DE autonomous vehicle; autonomous shuttle bus; public transportation;
   autonomous driving; game-changer
AB The rapid evolution of autonomous technology in the field of automotive and information technology (IT) has made it possible to implement autonomous vehicles (AVs) for public passenger transport. Although the shuttle bus transport capacities currently in use are low (maximum 15 people), the use of these transport units in large urban agglomerations is beneficial for society. The current paper is written to review the current AV implementation with respect to shuttle buses with its direct implications in their scientific evolution, with direct links to the legal and social aspects of public transportation all over the world. A critical aspect that is presented in the paper is the legal framework of autonomous driving, which is extremely uneven around the globe, with the direct impact of autonomous shuttle bus exploitation. As the legislation on AVs presents some shortcomings in the approval, registration, and public road implementation of these vehicles, many of the world's major cities have found ways to integrate them into testing programs, establishing the basis for future comprehensive legislative measures in this highly dynamic scientific domain. The current technological solutions adopted by several autonomous shuttle bus producers will be presented with an exhaustive overview of each major component. The aspects of the control algorithm, with its complicated layers of security and perturbance factors, will be explained in detail. Thus, in some countries/cities, autonomous shuttle buses have been implemented on less-traveled routes where they can travel at speeds up to 25 km/h without hindering the public's circulation, such as university campuses, industrial areas, airports, and sports bases. Some countries/cities use autonomous shuttle buses for pilot programs related to passenger transport, while others use them in postal transport and others for scientific purposes. In all of these situations, the first step in autonomous driving has been taken. The paper also makes an evaluation of the social factors that are a consequence of the mass introduction of autonomous driving as a means of public transportation. Autonomous shuttle buses are becoming a part of everyday life in big cities. Their acceptance as a strategic means of transport depends on their efficiency in daily services; through its efficiency, this means of transport will become a game-changer once its benefits become not only known but experienced by a large number of users.

The area of interest is first decomposed into grids of equal size and then partitioned into Voronoi cells. Each robot/sensor is assigned the task of covering the corresponding Voronoi cell. We propose an optimal gridding size and partitioning methodology that eliminate the coverage inefficiencies induced by the partitioning process. We carried out experiments using multiple quadcopters and mobile robots to demonstrate and validate the proposed multi-sensor coverage strategy.

AB Autonomous emergency braking (AEB) is an active safety technology which aims to prevent collisions by operating harsh braking. When AEB is activated on split-mu roads, the yaw moment generated by the asymmetric braking forces will lead to losing control of the vehicle. In this study, a coordinated control scheme of steer-by-wire (SBW) and brake-by-wire (BBW) is developed to solve this problem. An anti-lock braking system is achieved by a sliding mode controller. Besides, two model predictive controllers based on a 7-degree-of-freedom vehicle dynamics model are proposed for different road adhesion conditions. According to the simulation results, the proposed scheme can maintain the stability of the vehicle and achieve a satisfying braking efficiency under various friction differences between the two-side wheels. At last, the experiments are also carried out to verify the effectiveness and the real-time performance of the proposed scheme on a hardware-in-loop bench of BBW and SBW.

AB Ride-hailing is a clear initial market for autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) because it features high vehicle utilization levels and strong incentive to cut down labor costs. An extensive and reliable network of recharging infrastructure is the prerequisite to launch a lucrative AEV ride-hailing fleet. Hence, it is necessary to estimate the charging infrastructure demands for an AEV fleet in advance. This study proposes a charging system planning framework for a shared-use AEV fleet providing ride-hailing services in urban area. We first adopt an agent-based simulation model, called BEAM, to describe the complex behaviors of both passengers and transportation systems in urban cities. BEAM simulates the driving, parking and charging behaviors of the AEV fleet with range constraints and identifies times and locations of their charging demands. Then, based on BEAM simulation outputs, we adopt a hybrid algorithm to site and size charging stations to satisfy the charging demands subject to quality of service requirements. Based on the proposed framework, we estimate the charging infrastructure demands and calculate the corresponding economics and carbon emission impacts of electrifying a ride-hailing AEV fleet in the San Francisco Bay Area. We also investigate the impacts of various AEV and charging system parameters, e.g., fleet size, vehicle battery capacity and rated power of chargers, on the ride-hailing system's overall costs.

AB This paper describes a supervisor system for monitoring the operation of automated agricultural vehicles. The system analyses all of the information provided by the sensors and subsystems on the vehicles in real time and notifies the user when a failure or potentially dangerous situation is detected. In some situations, it is even able to execute a neutralising protocol to remedy the failure. The system is based on a distributed and multi-level architecture that divides the supervision into different subsystems, allowing for better management of the detection and repair of failures. The proposed supervision system was developed to perform well in several scenarios, such as spraying canopy treatments against insects and diseases and selective weed treatments, by either spraying herbicide or burning pests with a mechanical-thermal actuator. Results are presented for selective weed treatment by the spraying of herbicide. The system successfully supervised the task; it detected failures such as service disruptions, incorrect working speeds, incorrect implement states, and potential collisions. Moreover, the system was able to prevent collisions between vehicles by taking action to avoid intersecting trajectories. The results show that the proposed system is a highly useful tool for managing fleets of autonomous vehicles. In particular, it can be used to manage agricultural vehicles during treatment operations.

ID SAFETY; SPEED
AB (1) Background: Passenger vehicles equipped with advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) functionalities are becoming more prevalent within vehicle fleets. However, the full effects of offering such systems, which may allow for drivers to become less than 100% engaged with the task of driving, may have detrimental impacts on other road-users, particularly vulnerable road-users, for a variety of reasons. (2) Crash data were analysed in two countries (Great Britain and Australia) to examine some challenging traffic scenarios that are prevalent in both countries and represent scenarios in which future connected and autonomous vehicles may be challenged in terms of safe manoeuvring. (3) Road intersections are currently very common locations for vulnerable road-user accidents; traffic flows and road-user behaviours at intersections can be unpredictable, with many vehicles behaving inconsistently (e.g., red-light running and failure to stop or give way), and many vulnerable road-users taking unforeseen risks. (4) Conclusions: The challenges of unpredictable vulnerable road-user behaviour at intersections (including road-users violating traffic or safe-crossing signals, or taking other risks) combined with the lack of knowledge of CAV responses to intersection rules, could be problematic. This could be further compounded by changes to nonverbal communication that currently exist between road-users, which could become more challenging once CAVs become more widespread.

AB This paper presents an integrated linear parameter-varying (LPV) control approach of an autonomous vehicle with an objective to guarantee driving comfort, consisting of cruise and semi-active suspension control. First, the vehicle longitudinal and vertical dynamics (equipped with a semi-active suspension system) are presented and written into LPV state-space representations. The reference speed is calculated online from the estimated road type and the desired comfort level (characterized by the frequency weighted vertical acceleration defined in the ISO 2631 norm) using precomputed polynomial functions. Then, concerning cruise control, an LPV H2 controller using a linear matrix inequality (LMI) based polytopic approach combined with the compensation of the estimated disturbance forces is developed to track the comfort-oriented reference speed. To further enhance passengers' comfort, a decentralized LPV H2 controller for the semi-active suspension system is proposed, minimizing the effect of the road profile variations. The interaction with cruise control is achieved by the vehicle's actual speed being a scheduling parameter for suspension control. To assess the strategy's performance, simulations are conducted using a realistic nonlinear vehicle model validated from experimental data. The simulation results demonstrate the proposed approach's capability to improve driving comfort.

DT Article
DE augmented reality; hardware-in-the-loop; unmanned underwater vehicle;

AB System evaluation and testing of unmanned underwater vehicles in their destined environment can be tedious, error prone, time consuming, and consequently expensive. However, pre-real-world testing facilities, such as hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing, are not always available. This is due to the time and expense required to create a specific test environment for the vehicle. Thus the system is not as fault tolerant as it could be since problems can remain undetected until the real-world testing phase. Debugging and fixing errors in the real-world testing phase are much more time consuming and expensive owing to the nature of the harsh underwater environment. This paper introduces a novel framework, the augmented-reality framework (ARF), for the rapid construction of virtual-environment testing scenarios for testing remote platforms with embedded systems such as autonomous underwater vehicles. The ARF provides testing facilities across all stages of the reality continuum, providing capabilities for pure simulation, HIL, hybrid simulation, and real-world testing. The framework architecture is both very generic and flexible and allows mixing of real and simulated components. The ARF is supported by a distributed communications protocol which provides location transparency of systems since this is key to providing mixed-reality testing facilities.

AB Lateral control of an autonomous and connected vehicle (ACV), especially in emergency situations, is important from the safety viewpoint. In these situations, the trajectory to be followed by an ACV must either be planned in real-time (e.g., for a possible evasion maneuver if the obstacle to be avoided is detected) or be communicated from its preceding vehicle. Typically, the trajectory information is available to the following ACV in the form of GPS time samples. From the viewpoint of lateral control, the lateral velocity information is not readily available and the feedback structure must reflect this reality. In this paper, we develop a methodology to synthesize a lateral control algorithm for a following ACV in a two-vehicle platoon in two steps: 1) From the limited preview information of the trajectory to be tracked via samples of GPS way points, we estimate the radius of curvature of the trajectory using "least-square" estimation and 2) develop a fixed-structure feedback control scheme for following the predecessor by synthesizing the set of stabilizing gains corresponding to lateral position error, heading error and heading rate error. Numerical simulation and experimental results corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

AB Understanding and predicting the intention of pedestrians is essential to enable autonomous vehicles and mobile robots to navigate crowds. This problem becomes increasingly complex when we consider the uncertainty and multimodality of pedestrian motion, as well as the implicit interactions between members of a crowd, including any response to a vehicle. Our approach, Probabilistic Crowd GAN, extends recent work in trajectory prediction, combining Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) to output probabilistic multimodal predictions, from which likely modal paths are found and used for adversarial training. We also propose the use of Graph Vehicle-Pedestrian Attention Network (GVAT), which models social interactions and allows input of a shared vehicle feature, showing that inclusion of this module leads to improved trajectory prediction both with and without the presence of a vehicle. Through evaluation on various datasets, we demonstrate improvements on the existing state of the art methods for trajectory prediction and illustrate how the true multimodal and uncertain nature of crowd interactions can be directly modelled.

AB Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) technology provides the possibility of Slot-based Intersections. A space-time slot-based CAV operational control approach is proposed in this paper. Links connected to the intersection are divided into three areas: approach area, adjust area and maintain area. The double-loop Spatial Position Associating Time Series (SPATS) method and the Acceleration Dynamically Adjusting based on Predicted Trajectory (ADAPT) method are applied to guide the vehicles. The double-loop SPATS guarantees the vehicle safety, improves the traffic efficiency and maintains the performance of the method in heavy traffic. The ADAPT calculates the vehicle time-position curve as smoothly as possible. A simulation environment was established to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach. In the simulated intersection, the intersection can reach a maximum capacity of 5200 vehicles per hour. Other analyses, such as signal, stop sign and platoon control strategies, have demonstrated the superiority of the approach.

AB In the paper, a hydrodynamic model including the characteristics of maneuvering and seakeeping is developed to simulate the six-degree of freedom motions of the underwater vehicle steering near the sea surface. The corresponding wave exciting forces on the underwater vehicle moving in waves are calculated by the strip theory, which is based on the source distribution method. With the hydrodynamic coefficients relevant to the maneuvering and seakeeping, the fourth-order Runge-Kutta numerical method is adopted to solve the equations of motions and six-degrees of freedom of the motions for the underwater vehicle steering near the free surface can be obtained. The wave effect on the corresponding motions of the underwater vehicle is investigated and some interesting phenomena with respect to different wave frequencies and headings are observed. The hydrodynamic numerical model developed here can be served as a valuable tool for analyzing the ascending and descending behaviors of the underwater vehicle near the sea surface.

AB In a mixed traffic environment of human and autonomous driving, it is crucial for an autonomous vehicle to predict the lane change intentions and trajectories of vehicles that pose a risk to it. However, due to the uncertainty of human intentions, accurately predicting lane change intentions and trajectories is a great challenge. Therefore, this paper aims to establish the connection between intentions and trajectories and propose a dual Transformer model for the target vehicle. The dual Transformer model contains a lane change intention prediction model and a trajectory prediction model. The lane change intention prediction model is able to extract social correlations in terms of vehicle states and outputs an intention probability vector. The trajectory prediction model fuses the intention probability vector, which enables it to obtain prior knowledge. For the intention prediction model, the accuracy can be improved by designing the multi-head attention. For the trajectory prediction model, the performance can be optimized by incorporating intention probability vectors and adding the LSTM. Verified on NGSIM and highD datasets, the experimental results show that this model has encouraging accuracy. Compared with the model without intention probability vectors, the impact of the model on NGSIM dataset and highD dataset in RMSE is improved by 57.27% and 58.70% respectively. Compared with two existed models, evaluation metrics of the intention prediction can be improved by 7.40-10.09% on NGSIM dataset and 2.17-2.69% on highD dataset within advanced prediction time 1s. This method provides the insights for designing advanced perceptual systems for autonomous vehicles.

AB Autonomous vehicles have the potential to transform the way people are transported. While driverless technology may mean fewer vehicles are required to transport people to and from their daily activities, such changes may result in increased congestion or total miles traveled. In this study, we solve the single-household shared autonomous vehicle problem to identify cost-optimal routings of vehicles throughout the day. Such a tool will be useful for consumers seeking to minimize cost and for regulators seeking to understand and predict how people may behave in different scenarios. We provide a thorough literature review and construct a mixed-integer linear program to minimize the daily travel cost of a household attending a given set of activities. Since solution time is a determinant for applicability of such a model, we present the model in a component-wise fashion. This approach allows us to understand which features most affect the problem complexity and solution time. We note that modeling carpooling is the feature that most increases time to find an optimal solution, and we therefore propose a novel modeling technique for carpooling two people. We illustrate the performance of our model by comparing it with other models from the literature and note that our model can solve significantly larger problem instances and in a time that is short enough to facilitate real-time scheduling. We also highlight the utility of our model for regulators, who can use it to analyze quickly produced optimal routes under different cost/tax scenarios. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent technology advances significantly push forward the development and the deployment of the concept of smart, such as smart community and smart city. Smart transportation is one of the core components in modern urbanization processes. Under this context, the connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) system presents a promising solution towards the enhanced traffic safety and mobility through state-of-theart wireless communications and autonomous driving techniques. Being capable of collecting and transmitting real-time vehicle-specific, location-specific, and area-wide traffic information, it is believed that CAV-enabled transportation systems will revolutionize the existing understanding of network-wide traffic operations and reestablish traffic flow theory. This paper develops a new continuum dynamics model for the future CAV-enabled traffic system, realized by encapsulating mutually-coupled vehicle interactions using virtual internal and external forces. Leveraging Newton's second law of motion, our model naturally preserves the traffic volume and automatically handles both the longitudinal and lateral traffic operations due to its 2-D nature, which sets us apart from the existing macroscopic traffic flow models. Our model can also be rolled back to handle the comentional traffic of human drivers, and the experiment shows that the model describes real-world traffic behavior well. Therefore, we consider the proposed model a complement and generalization of the existing traffic theory. We also develop a smoothed particle hydrodynamics-based numerical simulation and an interactive traffic visualization framework. By posing user-specified external constraints, our system allows users to visually understand the impact of different traffic operations interactively.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to reshape travel behaviour and demand in part by enabling productive uses of travel time-a primary component of the "positive utility of travel" concept-thus reducing subjective values of travel time savings (VOT). Many studies from industry and academia have assumed significant increases in travel time use and reductions in VOT for AVs. In this position paper, I argue that AVs' VOT impacts may be more modest than anticipated and derive from a different source. Vehicle designs and operations may limit activity engagement during travel, with AV users feeling more like car passengers than train riders. Furthermore, shared AVs may attenuate travel time use benefits, and productivity gains could be limited to long-distance trips. Although AV riders will likely have greater activity participation during travel, many in-vehicle activities today may be more about coping with commuting burdens than productively using travel time. Instead, VOT reductions may be more likely to arise from a different "positive utility"-subjective well-being improvements through reduced stresses of driving or the ability to relax and mentally transition. Given high uncertainty, further empirical research on the experiential, time use, and VOT impacts of AVs is needed.

AB This paper discusses control strategies adapted for practical implementation and efficient motion of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). For AUVs we would like efficiency in both the measured time and the energy consumption, the mission dictating the weight to put on each of these cost. As a first approach to this problem, we focus in this paper on time minimization. Based on the structure of the time optimal trajectories and of the pure motions, we develop an algorithm to design time efficient trajectories corresponding to piecewise constant thrust arcs with few actuator switchings. We do that by solving a new optimization problem where the unknowns are the time period between two actuator switchings as well as the values of the constant thrust arcs. We apply a direct method to compute the solutions numerically. With our algorithm, we gain considerable computational time. Moreover, with as few as three actuator switchings, the duration of our trajectories is within 10% of the optimal trajectories. Since our control strategies have a simple structure they can be implemented on a test-bed vehicle. For the experiments displayed in this paper we use a spherical underwater vehicle which exhibits with almost no preference of direction or orientation for movement; this gives us a very controllable and versatile vehicle.

AB We present a new framework for creating lane-level detailed HD-maps at scale for autonomous vehicles (AVs). In order to overcome scaling challenges of ground survey-based HD-map creation, we propose a number of innovations by leveraging three data sources: high-resolution aerial imagery, aggregated vehicle telemetry, and a navigation map. We first divide map creation problem into several categories based on lane configurations. The road category is predicted in a supervised setting using aerial imagery, which is pre-processed by using aggregated vehicle telemetry without supervision. We utilized the navigation map to guide the process along the road network and used aerial imagery and aggregated vehicle telemetry to extract lane level features at each step. We propose a multi-task convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict road polygons, road-way centerline, number of lanes, lane and road edges using both the aerial imagery and the corresponding aggregated vehicle telemetry. The predicted road features for each image are then stitched along a road segment to construct the road and lane edge polylines, which are then used to predict lane marking and road edge types in a sliding window fashion along the road segment. The extracted features are finally utilized to calculate higher level features for each point in the HD-map. Our experimental results show that the proposed framework works well, offering a flexible solution for creating HD-maps for AVs at scale.

AB Mixed traffic flows are opening up new areas for research and are seen as key drivers in the field of data and services that will make roads safer and more environmentally friendly. Understanding the effects of Connected Vehicles (CVs) and Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), as one of the vehicle components of mixed traffic flows, will make it easier to avoid traffic congestion and contribute to the creation of innovative applications and solutions. It is notable that the literature related to the analysis of the impact of mixed traffic flows on traffic signal control in urban areas rarely considers mixed traffic flow containing CVs, CAVs, and Human Driven Vehicles (HDVs). Therefore, this paper provides an overview of the relevant research papers covering the topic of urban Traffic Signal Control (TSC) and mixed traffic flows. Best practices for intersection state estimation and TSC in the case of mixed traffic flows in an urban environment are summarized and possible approaches for utilizing CVs and CAVs as mobile sensors and actuators are discussed.

DT Article
ID TRACKING
AB In this paper, we show how autonomous vehicles performing a certain task can be controlled from one command center in order to achieve certain goals. The command center provides individual feedback gains to each vehicle in the form of one compounded feedback gain that in fact carries feedback gain information for each individual vehicle. Vehicles may be of different nature: satellites, cars, tanks, drowns, robots, unmanned aircraft, underwater vehicles, and ships. It is assumed that their dynamic is weakly coupled, namely, dynamics of each individual vehicle is weakly coupled to dynamics of all other vehicles and that they have the same control input. The weak coupling among the vehicles is represented either by physical interactions among vehicles or coordinating or communication signals. The results obtained are applicable to vehicles having different mathematical linear/linearized state space models. In the case when no interaction/coordination/communication among vehicles is present, and all feedback signals come from the command center (central controller) controller, the vehicle mathematical models can be identical. An important feature of the presented results is that different local feedback controllers can be facilitated for different vehicles using a unique global feedback controller signal designed by the command center. In this paper, we will consider cases of two and three vehicles, but the presented multistage feedback design methodology can be potentially extended to N vehicles. The presentation is done in continuous time. Similar derivations hold in the discrete-time domain.

ID TRAJECTORY TRACKING CONTROL; UNDERWATER VEHICLE; GUIDANCE; VESSELS
AB Most existing formation control approaches for Autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) focused on achieving rigid patterns with invariant inter-vehicle distance in open ocean environment. However, these methods cannot be applied to the cooperative missions on irregular inland waterway with changing width (such as rivers, canals and fjords), wherein the inter-vehicle distance should be continuously adjustable to respond to the environment dynamically. This paper proposes a bearing-based formation scaling control scheme for underactuated ASVs to achieve the desired patterns but with a flexible size scaling. By assuming that the fleet satisfies a leader-first-follower structure, the formation scaling parameters are accessible only to leaders, while each follower needs to maintain the bearing constraints to its neighboring ASVs without any knowledge of scale information. We respectively design distributed control laws for leaders and follower, and adaptive neural networks (NNs) are incorporated to approximate the dynamic uncertainties induced by parameter perturbations, external disturbances and input saturations. To improve the tracking performance, an auxiliary adaptive law is resorted to compensate the non-zero estimation error of NNs. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the closed-loop scaling maneuver tracking and formation tracking errors converge to zero asymptotically. The comparative simulation results are presented to substantiate the effectiveness of the designed control method.

AB This study explores, in the context of automated braking, how a voice alert accompanying the car's autonomous action affects the driver's attitude and driving behaviour. To examine the research question we designed an experimental setup in a simulator environment that (1) enabled automatic braking to perform as a vehicle's autonomous longitudinal behaviour and (2) enacted a voice alert system in a timely way to notify the driver of pending brake actions. Subjective driving experience and driver responses towards the car were strongly affected by the voice alerts when the car made automated decisions. These results have important implications for the design of vehicle-user interfaces, suggesting that, rather than simply developing a car that executes autonomous decisions, car makers should also focus on the human-machine interaction, i.e., on how the car announces its 'intentions' to act.

AB This article addresses the problem of optimally controlling trajectories of autonomous mobile agents (e.g., robots) so as to jointly minimize travel time and energy consumption in the presence of multiple spatio-temporal constraints on these trajectories. In addition to state and input constraints, we impose spatial equality and temporal inequality constraints viewed as interior-point constraints. We address this problem by first identifying the structure of the optimal agent controllable acceleration profile and showing that it is characterized by several parameters subsequently used for trajectory design optimization. Therefore, the infinite dimensional optimal control problem is transformed into a finite dimensional parametric optimization problem. The proposed algorithm is applied to the eco-driving problem of autonomous vehicles approaching multiple signalized intersections. We include simulation results to show quantitatively the advantages of the proposed solution.

AB Predicting the future velocity of vehicles is essential for the safety of autonomous driving and the Intelligent Transport System. This study investigates how the surrounding vehicles influence a driving vehicle. Based on the HighD dataset, a scenario that considers the current lane and the neighboring lanes is selected while the drivers' visual angles and visual gap angles along with other parameters in the dataset are characterized as features. To predict the velocity of a driving vehicle and calibrate the influence of surrounding vehicles, a Transformer-based model integrating the features of multiple vehicles is proposed, and different features are added to the layers while constructing the model. Moreover, the information from previous timestamps of the vehicle state is integrated to estimate the duration of the influences, since the influence of an incident is not instantaneous. In our experiments, we find that the duration of the influence on the driving state perfectly fits the driver's reaction time when maneuvers occur in the surrounding vehicles. In addition, we further quantify the importance of the influence on the vehicle velocity prediction based on the Random Forest and obtain some practical conclusions, for instance, the velocity of a vehicle is more influenced by the front vehicle in the left lane than that in the right lane, but is still mainly influenced by the front vehicle in the current lane.

AB Electric Vehicles (EVs) seem promising for future transportation to solve environmental concerns and energy management problems. According to Reuters, global car makers plan to invest over half a billion in more efficient and intelligent EVs and batteries. However, there are several challenges in EV mass production, including cybersecurity. Due to the cyber-physical nature of EVs and charging stations, their security and trustworthiness are ongoing challenges. In this study, we identify gaps in the security profiling of EVs and categorize them into five components: 1) charging station security, 2) information privacy, 3) software security, 4) connected vehicle security, and 5) autonomous driving security. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of identified vulnerabilities, threats, challenges and attacks for different EV security aspects, along with their possible surface/subsurface and countermeasures. We develop a comprehensive security risk assessment framework by first using EV security profiles and mapping identified vulnerabilities to a well-known threat model, STRIDE. Then, we classify the risk levels associated with each vulnerability by setting ground criteria for the impact and likelihood of the threats. Finally, we validate our risk assessment framework by applying the same criteria to eight real-world EV attack scenarios. As a result, researchers can adapt the proposed risk assessment framework to discover threats and assess their risks in EVs and charging station ecosystems.

AB Autonomous vehicles have been widely equipped with radars, camera, and LiDARs due to their complementary capabilities of environment perception. However, it becomes a critical task to accurately track the trajectory of the preceding vehicle when the host vehicle suffers a LiDAR failure under challenging lighting conditions. This article proposes an integrated learning-based solution to address this critical issue. It is composed of a Q-learning-based Gaussian mixture model (QLGMM) for clustering dense radar data, a weight-scheduled method for radar data association, and a switchable recurrent neural network with dual-level long short-term memory (LSTM) cells for trajectory tracking under LiDAR failure and various illumination levels. Specifically, the QLGMM is first introduced to improve the conventional GMM-EM algorithm with the cluster number determined by a Q-learning approach. Then, the weight-scheduled method is presented to associate the data from multiple radars. Furthermore, a switchable dual-level LSTM network is developed to adaptively fuse the trajectories from the radar and camera streams based on three lighting modes. The training data and testing data were acquired on a fully instrumented autonomous vehicle. Experimental verification demonstrates that the proposed method can achieve a promising improvement for LiDAR-fault-tolerant trajectory tracking under different lighting conditions.

AB This article discusses the development of a sensor fusion system for guiding an autonomous vehicle through citrus grove alleyways. The sensor system for path finding consists of machine vision and laser radar. An inertial measurement unit (IMU) is used for detecting the tilt of the vehicle, and a speed sensor is used to find the travel speed. A fuzzy logic enhanced Kalman filter was developed to fuse the information from machine vision, laser radar, IMU, and speed sensor. The fused information is used to guide a vehicle. The algorithm was simulated and then implemented on a tractor guidance system. The guidance system's ability to navigate the vehicle at the middle of the path was first tested in a test path. Average errors of 1.9 cm at 3.1 m s(-1) and 1.5 cm at 1.8 m s(-1) were observed in the tests. A comparison was made between guiding the vehicle using the sensors independently and using fusion. Guidance based on sensor fusion was found to be more accurate than guidance using independent sensors. The guidance system was then tested in citrus grove alleyways, and average errors of 7.6 cm at 3.1 m s(-1) and 9.1 cm at 1.8 m s(-1) were observed. Visually, the navigation in the citrus grove alleyway was as good as human driving.

AB This study proposes a novel mixed motion planning and tracking (MPT) control framework for autonomous vehicles (AVs) based on model predictive control (MPC), which is made up of an MPC-based longitudinal motion planning module, a feed-forward longitudinal motion tracking module, and an MPC-based integrated lateral motion planning and tracking module. First, given the global reference path and the surroundings information obtained from onboard devices and V2X network, the longitudinal motion planning based on a vehicle kinematics model is applied to determine the local target path, the desired longitudinal acceleration, and velocity considering the longitudinal safety priority. Then, based on the planned target path and longitudinal velocity, the integrated lateral MPT module based on a 2 degree-of-freedom vehicle model is developed to determine the optimal steering angle while satisfying the multiple kinematics and dynamics constraints. Finally, based on the desired longitudinal acceleration and the steering angle, the longitudinal forces of tires are determined. More importantly, co-simulations under several typical scenarios between MATLAB/Simulink and CarSim are conducted, and the results demonstrate excellent performance of the proposed mixed framework in both planning and tracking and also its real-time implementation.

AB An autonomous vehicle must accurately detect its surrounding environment to operate reliably. Adverse weather conditions (ADWC) are snow, rain, sand, and haze, badly affect the quality of vehicle detection (VD) in an autonomous environment. Most existing techniques focused on VD under various weather effects such as signal control, travel pattern, traffic volume variations and collision risk. Only a limited number of works of literature were focused on VD under ADWC at different automation scales. In this paper, a novel deep learning (DL) model, Optimized You Look Only Once Version 5 (OYOLOV5), is proposed for autonomous VD (AVD) in ADWC. The proposed model consists of three phases: data collection, data preprocessing, feature extraction and classification. Initially, the data is collected from the DAWN and COCO dataset to perform VD, which is openly available. The augmentation of the data is carried out on the collected input data by including hue, saturation, blur, brightness, and noise, which helps to get a clear view of vehicles. After data augmentation, feature extraction and classification of the preprocessed images are done using the OYOLOV5 framework, which uses Resnet-50 as the backbone network and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for detecting the vehicles at multi-scales. Experiments are conducted, and the outcomes demonstrated the proposed OYOLOV5 model achieves better performance with the state-of-art methods in terms of precision (PRC), recall (RC), f-measure (FMS), accuracy (ACU), average IoU (AI), processing speed (PS), and training time (TTI). Also, the system attains good mean average precision (mAP) than the conventional methods.

ID OBSTACLE DETECTION
AB Private and public transportation will be dominated by Autonomous Vehicles (AV), which are safer than regular vehicles. However, ensuring good performance for the autonomous features requires fast processing of heavy tasks. Providing each AV with powerful computing resources may result in increased AV cost and decreased driving range. An alternative solution is to install low-power computing hardware on each AV and offload the heavy tasks to powerful nearby edge servers. In this case, the AV's reaction time depends on how quickly the navigation tasks are completed in the edge server. To reduce task completion latency, the edge servers must be equipped with enough network and computing resources to handle the vehicle demands, which show large spatio-temporal variations. Thus, deploying the same resources in different locations may lead to unnecessary resource over-provisioning. In this paper, we leverage simulations using real traffic data to discuss the implications of deploying heterogeneous resources in different city areas to sustain peak versus average demand of edge-assisted AVs. Our analysis indicates that a reduction in network bandwidth and computing cores of up to 60% and 50%, respectively, is achieved by deploying edge resources for the average demand rather than peak demand. We also investigate how the peak-hour demand affects the safe travel time of AVs and find that it can be reduced by approximately 20% if they would be rerouted to areas with a lower edge-resource load. Thus, future research must consider that traditional turn-by-turn navigation systems may not provide the fastest routes for edge-assisted AVs.

AB Automated vehicles are a revolutionary step in mobility, providing a safe and convenient riding experience while keeping the human-driving task minimal to none. Therefore, these intelligent vehicles are equipped with sophisticated perception sensors (e.g., cameras and radars), high-performance computers, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven algorithms, and connectivity with other internet-of-things (IoT) devices. This makes autonomous vehicles (AVs) a special kind of cyber-physical system (CPS) that is moving at speed in highly interactive and dynamic environments (e.g., public roads). Thus, AV is a potential target for cyber attackers to weaponize, compromising safety and mobility on the road. The first step in addressing this problem is to have a robust threat modeling framework that can address the evolving cyber-physical threats, especially to AV applications. In this regard, two areas are studied in this paper: the common practice of threat modeling in automotive and the ISO/SAE 21434 standard, and sensors and machine learning (ML) algorithms for AV perception systems and potential cyber-physical attacks. A comparative threat analysis for an AV perception system with the ISO/SAE 21434 standard and a system-theoretic process analysis for security (STPA-Sec) approach is also demonstrated in this paper. Based on the analysis, this paper proposes a robust threat analysis and risk assessment framework with mathematical modeling to identify cyber-physical threats to AV perception systems that are critical for the driving behaviors and complex interactions of AVs in their operational design domain.

AB Path planning and tracking control are essential parts of autonomous vehicle research. Regarding path planning, the Rapid Exploration Random Tree Star (RRT*) algorithm has attracted much attention due to its completeness. However, the algorithm still suffers from slow convergence and high randomness. Regarding path tracking, the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) algorithm is widely used in various control applications due to its efficient stability and ease of implementation. However, the relatively empirical selection of its weight matrix can affect the control effect. This study suggests a path planning and tracking control framework for autonomous vehicles based on an upgraded RRT* and Particle Swarm Optimization Linear Quadratic Regulator (PSO-LQR) to address the abovementioned issues. Firstly, according to the driving characteristics of autonomous vehicles, a variable sampling area is used to limit the generation of random sampling points, significantly reducing the number of iterations. At the same time, an improved Artificial Potential Field (APF) method was introduced into the RRT* algorithm, which improved the convergence speed of the algorithm. Utilizing path pruning based on the maximum steering angle constraint of the vehicle and the cubic B-spline algorithm to achieve path optimization, a continuous curvature path that conforms to the precise tracking of the vehicle was obtained. In addition, optimizing the weight matrix of LQR using POS improved path-tracking accuracy. Finally, this article's improved RRT* algorithm was simulated and compared with the RRT*, target bias RRT*, and P-RRT*. At the same time, on the Simulink-Carsim joint simulation platform, the PSO-LQR is used to track the planned path at different vehicle speeds. The results show that the improved RRT* algorithm optimizes the path search speed by 34.40% and the iteration number by 33.97%, respectively, and the generated paths are curvature continuous. The tracking accuracy of the PSO-LQR was improved by about 59% compared to LQR, and its stability was higher. The position error and heading error were controlled within 0.06 m and 0.05 rad, respectively, verifying the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed path planning and tracking control framework.

AB As Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology enters developmental maturity, the need for real-life testing is crucial. AV testing and deployment in a city or State must be preceded by favorable legislation in that jurisdiction. However, research on which city characteristics affect the likelihood of adopting AV legislation remains in question. In this paper, we investigate city characteristics of different urbanized areas (UZAs) in States across the US. Panel data was collected from 29 UZAs and 23 States over the span of eight years (2011-2018) on variables such as existing AV legislations, electric vehicle score, congestion, and vehicle miles traveled (VMT). A method of fixed effects logistic regression is implemented to overcome omitted variable bias and the limitation of datasets available. Features are selected through the leaps and bounds algorithm, and time and State fixed-effects logistic regression models are tested to predict a binary variable for AV legislation enactment in UZAs. Our results yield a five-predictor State fixed effects model as the most robust by variable statistical significance and concordance. The findings reveal that an increase in electric vehicle use, GDP per capita, freeway VMT, and land use score of a UZA increase likelihood of AV testing adoption, while an increase in fatality cases negatively impact the like-lihood of adoption (Ceteris paribus).

AB The mixed traffic of conventional vehicles (CVs) and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) will dominate a long period in the popularization of CAVs and its dynamics are still not clear, especially in some complicated traffic scenarios. In this paper, an improved cellular automaton model was applied to investigate the CVs-CAVs mixed traffic dynamics around freeway merging area. The lane-changing rules were improved to consider the difference between CAVs and CVs and also the variation of drivers' aggressive driving during the merging process. The simulation has been conducted with different traffic demands and percentages of CAVs while the phase diagram, spatial-temporal diagram, characteristics of traffic volume, velocity profiles, stability and traffic conflict around the merging area were obtained. The results show that CAVs contribute to improving the traffic operation of freeway merging area in most conditions. However, more CAVs in the merging area without proper management will have a negative impact on traffic if the traffic demand for the main road is great. For example, the stability can decrease and particularly, the on-ramp traffic will be completely blocked when the percentage of CAVs is one. The findings can provide a basis for further research on the CVs-CAVs mixed traffic.

AB Designing a controller for autonomous vehicles capable of providing adequate performance in all driving scenarios is challenging due to the highly complex environment and inability to test the system in the wide variety of scenarios which it may encounter after deployment. However, deep learning methods have shown great promise in not only providing excellent performance for complex and non-linear control problems, but also in generalising previously learned rules to new scenarios. For these reasons, the use of deep learning for vehicle control is becoming increasingly popular. Although important advancements have been achieved in this field, these works have not been fully summarised. This paper surveys a wide range of research works reported in the literature which aim to control a vehicle through deep learning methods. Although there exists overlap between control and perception, the focus of this paper is on vehicle control, rather than the wider perception problem which includes tasks such as semantic segmentation and object detection. The paper identifies the strengths and limitations of available deep learning methods through comparative analysis and discusses the research challenges in terms of computation, architecture selection, goal specification, generalisation, verification and validation, as well as safety. Overall, this survey brings timely and topical information to a rapidly evolving field relevant to intelligent transportation systems.

AB In this paper, a cooperative time-varying formation maneuvering problem with connectivity preservation and collision avoidance is investigated for a fleet of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) with position-heading measurements. Each vehicle is subject to unknown kinetics induced by internal model uncertainty and external disturbances. At first, a nonlinear state observer is used to recover the unmeasured linear velocity and yaw rate as well as unknown uncertainty and disturbances. Then, observer-based cooperative time-varying formation maneuvering control laws are designed based on artificial potential functions, nonlinear tracking differentiators, and a backstepping technique. The stability of closed-loop distributed formation control system is analyzed based on input-to-state stability and cascade stability. The salient features of the proposed method are as follows. First, cooperative time-varying formation maneuvering with the capability of connectivity preservation and collision avoidance can be achieved in the absence of velocity measurements. Second, the complexity of the cooperative time-varying formation maneuvering control laws is reduced without resorting to dynamic surface control. Third, the uncertainty and disturbance are actively rejected in the presence of position-heading measurements. Simulation results are given to substantiate the proposed output feedback control method for cooperative time-varying formation maneuvering of ASVs with connectivity preservation and collision avoidance.

AB Motion planners for autonomous driving improve traffic safety through collision-free motion generation along the path. However, conventional motion planners render passengers uncomfortable as a result of jerky motion. To overcome this, we propose a model predictive control (MPC) based motion planner that not only ensures safety but also improves driving comfort. The proposed planner generates path tracking and collision-free maneuvers to ensure safety, and improve driving comfort by minimizing acceleration and jerk. Collision-free maneuvers include vehicle following and overtaking. The target speed is determined by comprehensively considering path tracking performance improvement and whether overtaking is possible. The speed of the vehicle is controlled by considering longitudinal acceleration and jerk minimization. The steering command is determined by considering both path tracking error reduction, and lateral acceleration and jerk minimization. In cases where vehicle overtaking is required and during high-speed driving conditions, the consideration of lateral acceleration and jerk minimization increases to improve driving comfort. The proposed planner is formulated as a convex optimization problem. The effectiveness of the proposed planner was evaluated in path tracking and collision avoidance simulations. The simulation results confirm that the proposed planner ensures vehicle safety through lane keeping and collision avoidance, and improves driving comfort.

AB Path tracking plays an essential role in autonomous vehicles. To ensure tracking accuracy and improve tracking adaptability in different velocities, a path tracking strategy based on an improved model predictive control (MPC) method is presented in this research. First, a path tracking controller based on improved MPC based an online Updating algorithm is constructed. The update mechanism is triggered by using the cosine similarity, when the cosine similarity is lower than the predefined threshold value, making the state space and cost function of MPC match real-time conditions to rectify the sensitivity of MPC to vehicle speed. Additionally, to further enhance the controller's performance, a fuzzy control is employed to determine the horizon factor for optimizing the prediction horizon and control horizon online. Also, the weighting factors of the prediction horizon and control horizon are discussed to improve the adaptability at varying velocities. Next, the improved MPC controller is compared with the traditional MPC controller for a double lane change maneuver. The validation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy achieves good adaptability with satisfactory tracking accuracy at various velocities. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed strategy is verified in a real prototype vehicle test.

AB To enhance the lane-changing safety of autonomous vehicles, it is crucial to accurately identify the driving styles of human drivers in scenarios involving the coexistence of autonomous and human-driven vehicles, aiming to avoid encountering vehicles exhibiting hazardous driving patterns. In this study, based on the real traffic flow data from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset in the United States, 301 lane-changing vehicles that meet the criteria are selected. Six evaluation parameters are chosen, and principal component analysis (PCA) is employed for dimensionality reduction in the data. The K-means algorithm is then utilized to cluster the driving styles, classifying them into three categories. Finally, ant colony optimization (ACO) of a backpropagation (BP) neural network model was constructed, utilizing the dimensionality reduction results as inputs and the clustering results as outputs for the purpose of driving style recognition. Simulation experiments are conducted using MATLAB Version 9.10 (R2021a) for comparative analysis. The results indicate that the constructed ACO-BP model achieved an overall recognition accuracy of 96.7%, significantly higher than the recognition accuracies of the BP, artificial neural network (ANN), and gradient boosting machine (GBM) models. The ACO-BP model also exhibited the fastest recognition speed among the four models. Moreover, the ACO-BP model shows varied improvements in recognition accuracy for each of the three driving styles, with an increase of 13.7%, 4.4%, and 4.3%, respectively, compared to the BP model. The simulation results validate the high accuracy, real-time capability, and classification effectiveness of this model in driving style recognition, providing new insights for this field.

AB With the rapid development of autonomous driving, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have started to appear on public roads, which has inevitably affected current traffic conditions and the operations of Manual Vehicles (MVs). Current research on AVs' influence has mainly been conducted at individual level of driving behaviors, while few studies have focused on the overall network level to consider the traffic flow pattern due to mixed traffic. In this work, considering varying signal control schemes and demand loading patterns, we conducted simulation experiments based on a grid network and a real-world network in Beijing using SUMO. Traffic flow with the mixture of MVs, low-level AVs (LAVs), and high-level AVs (HAVs) were emulated so to investigate how the network performs at various levels of mixed traffic. Driving behaviors between the three types of vehicles were calibrated using driving data drawn from OpenACC dataset, and Waymo Open Dataset. The capacity and critical accumulation of the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) were chosen as the key indicators of network performance. We found that AVs positively boost network capacity (up to 19.0% increase) but a negative influence on critical accumulation was also observed (up to 9.0% decrease). However, the positive impact of OpenACC and Waymo's AVs on macroscopic traffic is still far from ideal since they may be too conservative. AVs can boost flow when traffic is in unsaturated or saturated states. However, when traffic flow is oversaturated, AVs can instead cause flow and average speed to drop faster than that in the MV-only scenario.

AB An Autonomous Vehicle (AV) is believed to he the next generation transport that can enhance safety and efficiency for smart mobility. In an AV-based public transportation system, the full autonomy of AVs enables high-efficiency transport services and the potential ride-sharing feature of AV system enhances the utilization. The system manages a fleet of AVs, determines their assignments to transport requests, sends instructions concerning the optimized plans, and recommends the parking locations for the unoccupied AVs. The parking location of an empty AV is crucial in the sense that rebalancing AVs to areas with high potential service demand can curtail the unnecessary waiting time for passengers. As AVs are generally electric, proper parking locations can also facilitate vehicle-to-grid (V2G) support. In this paper, we propose a joint rebalancing and V2G coordination strategy for AV-based public transportation system. We formulate the problem as an integer linear program and propose a heuristic based on Genetic Algorithm and Model Predictive Control to solve the problem in low time complexity. Extensive experiments are performed with the real taxi service data from New York City. The formulated integer linear program is solved dynamically where each problem instance contains 3 to 5 AVs and 3 to 8 requests in 30s time interval. Compared with the transport system without rebalancing, the results show that the coordination strategy is efficient and effective in reducing unnecessary waiting time for passengers while satisfying V2G support. Compared to computational time with the standard solver, the proposed heuristic dramatically reduces the computational time.

AB Over the last decade, the Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) concept has evolved significantly. ADAS involves several technologies such as automotive electronics, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, RADAR, LIDAR, computer vision, and machine learning. Of these, computer vision and machine learning based solutions have mainly been effective that have allowed real-time vehicle control, driver aided systems, etc. However, most of the existing works deal with the deployment of ADAS and autonomous driving functionality in countries with well-disciplined lane traffic. Nevertheless, these solutions and frameworks do not work in countries and cities with less-disciplined/chaotic traffic. This paper identifies the research gaps, reviews the state-of-the-art looking at the different functionalities of ADAS and its levels of autonomy. Importantly, it provides a detailed description of vision intelligence and computational intelligence for ADAS. The eye-gaze and head pose estimation in vision intelligence is detailed. Notably, the learning algorithms such as supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning and deep learning solutions for ADAS are considered and discussed. Significantly, this would enable developing a real-time recommendation system for system-assisted/autonomous vehicular environments with less-disciplined road traffic.

AB Most of the previous works on the motion control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) assume that (i) the vehicle actuators are able to tolerate every level of the control signals, and (ii) the vehicle is equipped with the velocity sensors in all degrees of freedom. These assumptions are not desirable in practice. Toward this end, this paper addresses the trajectory tracking control of the underactuated AUVs with the limited torque, without the velocity measurements and under environmental disturbances in a three-dimensional space. At first, a variable transformation is introduced which helps us to derive a second-order dynamic model for underactuated AUVs. Then, a saturated tracking controller is proposed by employing the saturation functions to bound the closed-loop error variables. This technique reduces the risk of the actuators saturation by decreasing the amplitude of the generated control signals. In addition, a nonlinear saturated observer is introduced to remove the velocity sensors from the control system. The proposed controller copes with the uncertain vehicle parameters, and constant or time-varying environmental disturbances induced by the waves and ocean currents. Lyapunov's direct method is used to show the semi-global uniform ultimate boundedness of the tracking and state estimation errors. Finally, some simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

AB As the operational domain of autonomous vehicles expands, encountering occlusions during navigation becomes unavoidable. Most of the existing research on occlusion-aware motion planning focuses only on the longitudinal motion of the ego vehicle and neglects its lateral motion, resulting in output motion that can be overly conservative. This paper proposes a motion planner capable of actively adjusting the ego vehicle's lateral position to minimize occlusions. The proposed planner is applicable in various scenarios and can function under perception uncertainty. This work also extends our previously proposed 3D visibility estimation approach for addressing occlusions caused by objects which are not present in HD maps. The proposed planner first generates candidate trajectories. The current and future visibility of each trajectory is then estimated using live LiDAR data and HD maps. These estimated visibilities are converted into visibility costs, which are then used to determine the optimal output trajectory in conjunction with other planning costs. The proposed planner is tested in three scenarios using the CARLA simulator: an occluded T-junction crossing, turning at a low-visibility corner and preparing to pass a parked vehicle, using live localization and object detection results. The experimental results reveal that the proposed planner allows the ego vehicle to minimize occlusions by diverging from the center of the lane and, consequently, to discover occluded vehicles earlier than a baseline planner in most situations. Moreover, occlusions caused by a parked vehicle not present in the HD maps were estimated correctly using our extended visibility estimation method.

AB This paper focuses on Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) in autonomous vehicles. In CACC, vehicles regulate their speed according to a preceding "leader" vehicle in the lane, forming a platoon. In a benign environment, CACC reduces fuel consumption, maximizes road capacity, and ensures traffic safety. However, CACC is vulnerable to various security threats. In this paper, we consider one of the critical threats, where the platoon leader is compromised, and forges acceleration information sent to platoon members. Such attack would lead to traffic instability and potential collisions. First, we propose information sharing in CACC model to allow vehicles and fixed infrastructure to sense and share information about platoon leaders, hence improves the reliability and supports the detection of anomalous behavior. Then, we propose a real-time anomaly detection mechanism that combines statistical learning with the physics laws of kinematics. Specifically, we propose Generalized Extreme Studentized Deviate with Sliding Chunks (GESD-SC) approach, which is applied at each vehicle in the platoon to detect anomalies in real-time based on the vehicle's own speeding decisions. Kinematic model is also utilized to detect unexpected deviations using the leader's information, communicated directly and observed by the leader's neighboring vehicle(s) and/or supporting infrastructure. Combining kinematic model with GESD-SC has shown to be effective in detecting falsification attacks in CACC. Furthermore, we analyze the time performance, and show that the proposed technique outperforms existing method in detection accuracy and processing time.

AB The article focuses on the issue of data governance in connected vehicles through a novel analysis of current legal frameworks in the European Union. The analysis of relevant legislation, judicial decisions, and doctrines is supplemented by discussions relating to associated sustainability issues. Relevant notions of autonomous vehicles are analyzed, and a respective legal framework is introduced. Although fully automated vehicles are a matter for the future, the time to regulate is now. The European Union aims to create cooperative, connected, and automated mobility based on cooperation between different interconnected types of machinery. The essence of the system is data flow, as data governance in connected vehicles is one of the most intensively discussed themes nowadays. This triggers a need to analyze relevant legal frameworks in connection with fundamental rights and freedoms. Replacing human decision-making with artificial intelligence has the capacity to erode long-held and protected social and cultural values, such as the autonomy of individuals as has already been in evidence in legislation. Finally, the article deals with the issue of responsibility and liability of different actors involved in processing personal data according to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applied to the environment of connected and automated vehicle (CAV) smart infrastructure. Based on a definition and analysis of three model situations, we point out that in several cases of processing personal data within the CAV, it proves extremely demanding to determine the liable entity, due to the functional and relatively broad interpretation of the concept of joint controllers, in terms of the possibility of converging decisions on the purposes and means of processing within the vehicles discussed.

AB Given many known and unknown uncertainties, it is hard to forecast reliably the mode choices, expected to prevail with autonomous vehicle (AV) technology; however, the key to getting some idea lies in understanding the preferences of end users. In this vein, a random parameters logit model is employed to study the consumers' preferences in small- and medium-sized metropolitan areas, based on their travel behavior and household characteristics, socio-demographic features, awareness about AV technology and new travel choices, psychological factors, and built environment features. Most of the past studies hypothesize that due to a wide range of anticipated benefits, there would be increased use of AVs especially as a shared service where multiple travelers use the same AV concomitantly. However, the results from this study do not support the hypothesis that vehicle ownership will be an obsolete model at least during the early phase of transitioning to the self-driving era (when roads are expected to contain vehicles with and without human drivers). The findings of this study reveal key factors influencing consumer preferences and offer important insights to technology developers and service providers in understanding the ways consumers would like to use this technology and hence, defining the business model.

AB A persistent problem facing today's engineering educators is how to promote students' interest in science and engineering. One of the best approaches to this challenge is to sponsor a technological competition that combines publicity, technology, and student participation, A current leading competition called ''micromouse,'' although earning high marks on publicity and technology, has had difficulty attracting large-scale student participation. In this paper a vision-guided autonomous vehicle project developed at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) is proposed as an alternative. The idea is to fit an ordinary radio-controlled toy car with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera and a transmitter, Image processing and control of the car are accomplished by a personal computer (PC), The road image captured by the camera is transmitted to a PC via a transmitter-receiver pair at 900 MHz. A frame grabber board digitizes the image, and an image-processing program subsequently analyzes the road condition and generates adequate drive commands that are transmitted back to the vehicle via the builtin radio controller. Student teams write programs to compete in racing or maze solving. In this paper detailed hardware and software designs of the project are presented, The merit of the project with respect to the criteria of publicity, technology, and student participation is also addressed.

AB This article presents a variable buoyancy system that uses cephalopod-inspired, fiber-reinforced elastomer membranes as bladders to enable model-based depth and pitch control of an autonomous underwater vehicle. The fiber reinforcement allows for a single measurement of each membrane to fully define the geometry of the membrane, regardless of the membrane's orientation or level of inflation. This allows for precise control of each bladder's enclosed water mass and center of mass by adjusting the differential pressure between the inside of the bladder and the vehicle's cabin using water from the environment as the working fluid. Positioning bladders at the fore and aft of the vehicle enables control of both the vehicle's density and center of mass while minimizing center of mass disturbances due to sloshing in and gravitational loads on the membranes. A nonlinear, adaptive, backstepping, trajectory-tracking controller is presented and proven to be asymptotically stable with Lyapunov stability analysis. The advantages of the proposed variable buoyancy system and controller are demonstrated through simulation and validated with 2 degree of freedom depth and pitch step and trajectory-tracking experiments in a large water tank. We evaluate the performance of the bladders and controller on the CephaloBot, an autonomous underwater vehicle designed and built by our group.

AB Accurate vehicle ego-localization is key for autonomous vehicles to complete high-level navigation tasks. The state-of-the-art localization methods adopt visual and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) to estimate the position of the vehicle. However, both of them may suffer from error accumulation due to long-term running without loop optimization or prior constraints. Actually, the vehicle cannot always return to the revisited location, which will cause errors to accumulate in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-challenged environments. To solve this problem, we proposed a novel localization method with prior dense visual point cloud map constraints generated by a stereo camera. Firstly, the semi-global-block-matching (SGBM) algorithm is adopted to estimate the visual point cloud of each frame and stereo visual odometry is used to provide the initial position for the current visual point cloud. Secondly, multiple filtering and adaptive prior map segmentation are performed on the prior dense visual point cloud map for fast matching and localization. Then, the current visual point cloud is matched with the candidate sub-map by normal distribution transformation (NDT). Finally, the matching result is used to update pose prediction based on the last frame for accurate localization. Comprehensive experiments were undertaken to validate the proposed method, showing that the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of translation and rotation are less than 5.59 m and 0.08 degrees, respectively.

ID AUTOMATED VEHICLES; ROUTING PROBLEM
AB Traffic congestion in urban areas has become a critical problem that municipal governments cannot overlook. Meanwhile, mixed traffic systems containing both autonomous and human-driven electric vehicles ramp up the challenge for traffic management in urban areas. Although numerous researchers have proposed traffic control heuristics to alleviate traffic congestion problems in the recent literature, scant research has addressed the joint problems of route and charging strategies for electric vehicles along with urban traffic congestion prevention. Accordingly, this work tackles the complex task of traffic management in urban areas during peak periods by using practical congestion prevention strategies that consider the characteristics of mixed traffic flows and the charging demands of electric vehicle users. Notably, we apply support vector regressions to compute the charging time at each charging point and the traverse time of an electric vehicle at each road segment/intersection, based on historical traffic data. The simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithms are feasible because they can avoid possible occurrences of traffic congestion during rush hours and provide the routes and charging options that are chosen by electric vehicle users.

AB Rapid technological development has changed drastically the automotive industry. Network communication has improved, helping the vehicles transition from completely machine- to software-controlled technologies. The autonomous vehicle network is controlled by the controller area network (CAN) bus protocol. Nevertheless, the autonomous vehicle network still has issues and weaknesses concerning cybersecurity due to the complexity of data and traffic behaviors that benefit the unauthorized intrusion to a CAN bus and several types of attacks. Therefore, developing systems to rapidly detect message attacks in CAN is one of the biggest challenges. This study presents a high-performance system with an artificial intelligence approach that protects the vehicle network from cyber threats. The system secures the autonomous vehicle from intrusions by using deep learning approaches. The proposed security system was verified by using a real automatic vehicle network dataset, including spoofing, flood, replaying attacks, and benign packets. Preprocessing was applied to convert the categorical data into numerical. This dataset was processed by using the convolution neural network (CNN) and a hybrid network combining CNN and long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) models to identify attack messages. The results revealed that the model achieved high performance, as evaluated by the metrics of precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. The proposed system achieved high accuracy (97.30%). Along with the empirical demonstration, the proposed system enhanced the detection and classification accuracy compared with the existing systems and was proven to have superior performance for real-time CAN bus security.

AB Increasingly complex automated driving functions, specifically those associated with free space detection (FSD), are delegated to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). If the dataset used to train the network lacks diversity, modality, or sufficient quantities, the driver policy that controls the vehicle may induce safety risks. Although most autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) perform well in structured surroundings, the need for human intervention significantly rises when presented with unstructured niche environments. To this end, we developed an AGV for seamless indoor and outdoor navigation to collect realistic multimodal data streams. We demonstrate one application of the AGV when applied to a self-evolving FSD framework that leverages online active machine-learning (ML) paradigms and sensor data fusion. In essence, the self-evolving AGV queries image data against a reliable data stream, ultrasound, before fusing the sensor data to improve robustness. We compare the proposed framework to one of the most prominent free space segmentation methods, DeepLabV3+ [1]. DeepLabV3+ [1] is a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation model composed of a CNN and an autodecoder. In consonance with the results, the proposed framework outperforms DeepLabV3+ [1]. The performance of the proposed framework is attributed to its ability to self-learn free space. This combination of online and active ML removes the need for large datasets typically required by a CNN. Moreover, this technique provides case-specific free space classifications based on the information gathered from the scenario at hand.

AB Developing a machine vision based autonomous utility vehicle for agricultural application is a challenging task due to changing physical landmarks. While most research thus far has developed algorithms that take advantage of ground structures such as trunks and canopies in the orchard, this research uses the combination of the canopy with the background sky. By focusing on the tree canopy and sky of an orchard row, an unmanned ground vehicle can extract features that can be used for autonomously navigating through the center of the tree rows. This was attempted by using a small-unmanned ground vehicle platform driven by four motors and guided by a machine vision system. The machine vision system is composed of a multispectral camera to capture real-time images and a personal computer to process the images and obtain the features used for autonomous navigation. Laboratory field tests showed that the small vehicle platform system was able to navigate autonomously with an RMS error of 2.35 cm. Field tests using a peach orchard showed that the small vehicle platform system could navigate the rows autonomously with an RMS error of 2.13 cm. The machine vision algorithm developed in this study has the potential to guide small utility vehicles in the orchard in the future. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Concerns regarding the influence of the marine environment, such as surface currents and winds, on autonomous marine vehicles have been raised in recent years. A number of researchers have been working on the development of intelligent path planning algorithms to minimise the negative effects of environmental influences, however most of this work focuses on the platform of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with very little work on unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). This paper presents a novel multi-layered fast marching (MFM) method developed to generate practical trajectories for USVs when operating in a dynamic environment. This method constructs a synthetic environment framework, which incorporates the information of planning space and surface currents. In terms of the planning space, there are repelling and attracting forces, which are evaluated using an attractive/repulsive vector field construction process. The influence of surface currents is weighted against the obstacles in the planning space using a 4-regime risk strategy. A trajectory is then calculated using the anisotropic fast marching method. The complete algorithm has been tested and validated using simulated surface currents, and the performance of generated trajectories have been evaluated in terms of different optimisation criteria, such as the distance and energy consumption.

AB This paper studies a mixed-service operation of shared-use autonomous mobility systems (SAMS) where customers can request rides either immediately or through reservations and use the vehicle for a point-to-point service or a time-slot-based rental service, respectively. Three autonomous-vehicle-to-user assignment strategies are presented: a first-come-first-served strategy and two optimization-based (bipartite matching) strategies. The mathematical formulations attempt to achieve a good trade-off between the wait times of reservation-based users and on-demand users, while minimizing overall empty fleet miles. A case study in Chicago is presented using taxi data, and the combined mixed-service fleet operation is compared with a case with two separate operations: one for an on-demand point-to-point service and one for a reservation-based time-slot rental service. Results show that a combined mixed-service operation can provide a more balanced service than the case with two separate operations with respect to the key performance measures of wait time and empty fleet miles.

AB We describe a practical path-planning algorithm for an autonomous vehicle operating in an unknown semi-structured (or unstructured) environment, where obstacles are detected online by the robot's sensors. This work was motivated by and experimentally validated in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge, where robotic vehicles had to autonomously navigate parking lots. The core of our approach to path planning consists of two phases. The first phase uses a variant of A*search (applied to the 3D kinematic state space of the vehicle) to obtain a kinematically feasible trajectory. The second phase then improves the quality of the solution via numeric non-linear optimization, leading to a local (and frequently global) optimum. Further, we extend our algorithm to use prior topological knowledge of the environment to guide path planning, leading to faster search and final trajectories better suited to the structure of the environment. We present experimental results from the DARPA Urban Challenge, where our robot demonstrated near-flawless performance in complex general path-planning tasks such as navigating parking lots and executing U-turns on blocked roads. We also present results on autonomous navigation of real parking lots. In those latter tasks, which are significantly more complex than the ones in the DARPA Urban Challenge, the time of a full replanning cycle of our planner is in the range of 50-300 ms.

AB This article reports a method for integrating a low-cost positioning system, constructed using a Garmin N17 global positioning system (GPS) and an integrated inertial sensor unit, consisting of three single-axis microelectromechanical system (MEMS) gyros and one triaxial MEMS accelerometer, for autonomous off-highway vehicle use. Based on a vehicle position-velocity-attitude (PVA) model, a data fusion algorithm was formulated to extract more accurate and reliable positioning information from the raw data sensed by the GPS and inertial sensor unit. The developed integrated positioning system (IPS) was evaluated on an agricultural utility vehicle on three different sites. A real-time kinematic (RTK) differential GPS unit, capable of providing 2-3 cm dynamic positioning accuracy while the position dilution of precision is low enough, was installed on the test vehicle to provide accurate positioning references in those evaluation tests. Results obtained from those tests showed that, when the vehicle was travelling on paved roads near buildings and/or under the trees, the maximum positioning error of the developed IPS was 0.50 m, and that this maximum error level was reduced to 0.30 m when the vehicle was travelling in open fields. The IPS could provide a position update rate at 50 Hz; even the GPS could provide only a I Hz update rate. Test results also revealed that this system could continuously provide accurate position signals when the GPS signal is lost for up to 30s. This research verified that a low-cost IPS could provide satisfactory position information for autonomous off-highway vehicle uses.

ID ROBUST; ASSISTANCE; SYSTEMS
AB In this paper a nested PID steering control in vision based autonomous vehicles is designed and experimentally tested to perform path following in the case of roads with an uncertain curvature. The control input is the steering wheel angle: it is designed on the basis of the yaw rate, measured by a gyroscope, and the lateral offset, measured by the vision system as the distance between the road centerline and a virtual point at a fixed distance from the vehicle. No lateral acceleration and no lateral speed measurements are required. A PI active front steering control based on the yaw rate tracking error is used to improve the vehicle steering dynamics. The yaw rate reference is computed by an external control loop which is designed using a PID control with a double integral action based on the lateral offset to reject the disturbances on the curvature which increase linearly with respect to time. The proposed control scheme leads to a nested architecture with two independent control loops that allows us to design standard PID controls in a multivariable context (two outputs, one input). The robustness of the controlled system is theoretically investigated with respect to speed variations and uncertain vehicle physical parameters. Several simulations are carried out on a standard big sedan CarSim vehicle model to explore the robustness with respect to unmodelled effects. The simulations show reduced lateral offset and new stable mu-split braking maneuvres in comparison with the model predictive steering controller implemented by CarSim. Finally the proposed control law is successfully tested by experiments using a Peugeot 307 prototype vehicle on the test track in Satory, 20 km west of Paris. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Emissions from transportation fuel vehicles are polluting the environment more than ever before. Currently, autonomous delivery vehicles (ADVs) are welcomed by logistics service providers and lots of consumers in general for their significant contribution in reducing environmental pollution and increasing delivery efficiency. However, there is a lack of in-depth research on consumers' willingness to adopt ADVs, despite the fact that ADVs are innovative delivery method in the field of last-mile delivery. The purpose of the study is to expand the existing knowledge of consumers' adoption behaviors by developing and testing the extended Value-Belief-Norm (VBN) theory in autonomous delivery literature. In particular, the study adds subjective norms and COVID-19 risk into the original VBN model as a theoretical framework to gain a comprehensive understanding of the consumer decision-making processes with respect to their intentions to use ADVs. Structural equation modeling is conducted using data from a web-based survey of 561 consumers through an online sample platform. The results of the study demonstrated that both subjective norms and COVID-19 risk are all related with consumers' intention to use ADVs. The casual chain hypotheses of the extend VBN theory mentioned in our study are all supported. The results of the study make significant theoretical and managerial contributions to the field of last-mile delivery and the adoption behaviors of emerging technologies.

AB Autonomous mobile robots use computational techniques of great complexity so that to allow navigation in various types of dynamic environments, avoiding collisions with obstacles and always seeking to optimize the best route, ultimately enabling them to operate in a safe and precise manner. In order for navigation at this level to be possible, a variety of computer vision and intelligent sensing techniques are used. The potential of an intelligent computer vision system to detect and predict the actions of dynamic agents on the streets is applied to increase traffic safety with intelligent robotic vehicles. In this paper we present a systematic review of computer vision models for the detection and tracking of obstacles in traffic environments. Specifically, we cover works involving 2D and 3D (stereo vision) data fusion for both internal and external perception, as well as current trends regarding efficient model design and temporally-aware architectures. We provide a thorough discussion on the main positive and negative points of the state-of-the-art in Visual Robotic Attention, as well as share our experience and contributions in applying visual perception for external obstacle detection and tracking, and internal (driver) monitoring. The results presented should serve as a compilation of the history of visual perception for autonomous mobile robots (specifically, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Vehicles), thus providing the reader with a comprehensive basis on both the main contributions and the state-of-the-art in the field.

AB Ocean renewable technologies have been rapidly developing over the past years. However, current high installation, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning costs are hindering these offshore technologies to reach a commercialization stage. In this paper we focus on the use of divers and remotely-operated vehicles during the installation and monitoring phase of wave energy converters. Methods and results are based on the wave energy converter system developed by Uppsala University, and our experience in offshore deployments obtained during the past eleven years. The complexity of underwater operations, carried out by either divers or remotely-operated vehicles, is emphasized. Three methods for the deployment of wave energy converters are economically and technically analyzed and compared: one using divers alone, a fully-automated approach using remotely-operated vehicles, and an intermediate approach, involving both divers and underwater vehicles. The monitoring of wave energy converters by robots is also studied, both in terms of costs and technical challenges. The results show that choosing an autonomous deployment method is more advantageous than a diver-assisted method in terms of operational time, but that numerous factors prevent the wide application of robotized operations. Technical solutions are presented to enable the use of remotely-operated vehicles instead of divers in ocean renewable technology operations. Economically, it is more efficient to use divers than autonomous vehicles for the deployment of six or fewer wave energy converters. From seven devices, remotely-operated vehicles become advantageous.

AB Nowadays, there is an active stage of development of advanced energy-saving technologies in the field of automotive industry, and therefore, electric vehicles are becoming increasingly popular. One of the main indicators of the efficiency of autonomous electric transport is the power reserve, the increase of which can be achieved by reducing the weight of the vehicle. In classic cars, the torque from the internal combustion engine is passed to the wheels by means of a transmission. In electric vehicles, due to the use of motor wheels, there is no need for a transmission, which significantly reduces the weight of the construction, as well as reduces maintenance and repair costs. The article considers the issue of power distribution of engines of an autonomous electric vehicle based on four-wheel hub motor. A mathematical description of an electronic differential for an electric car based on two and four motor wheels based on the Ackerman control principle is also obtained. A digital simulation of the four-wheel drive electric vehicle system was carried out in the MATLAB/Simulink software. Transients are obtained in terms of the speed of rotation of the engine shaft and the torque on the engine shaft, which satisfy the requirements for overregulation and quickness of the system.

TI Modeling Lane-Changing Behaviors for Autonomous Vehicles Based on
   Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication

ID SECTION
AB With the advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS), there has been a growing interest in studying driving behaviors within the field of transportation science. Given that the transition period of mixed traffic is expected to continue for more than 30 years, it is crucial to evolve AV technology to resemble human driving, especially in the freeway weaving sections. Lane-changing (LC) maneuvers in these sections could cause problems for traffic flow, such as traffic breakdown, oscillation, or bottleneck activation. This study proposes an interpretable LC implementation model for naturalistic driving behaviors of AVs based on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. To achieve this objective, a systematic selection process is adopted to find optimal V2V features that resemble how human drivers assess LC situations. Based on the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm, seven V2V features have been selected out of 25 candidates. Then, a support vector machine (SVM) is employed to investigate how these features exhibit in each of LC and lane-keeping (LK) situations. The proposed model was applied in a field case of a weaving Section on freeway US 101. Performance measures of simple accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score show high accuracy of 0.9814, 0.9150, 0.7955, and 0.8511, respectively. Subsequently, a strategy for naturalistic LC behaviors of AVs was simulated. The proposed model outperforms high prediction accuracy compared to other existing models. Particularly, errors in the lateral movements have significantly improved. These results suggest that the proposed model effectively simulates naturalistic LC behaviors based on V2V communication.

AB We present the Maneuverable Piccolissimo 2 (MP2), an autonomous, controllable, single motor micro aerial vehicle (MAV). The small size of MP2 makes it safe to operate in the presence of humans, and its simple design facilitates the creation of large swarms of capable MAVs. MP2 is equipped with on-board sensing capabilities and uses active environmental beacons to compute its three-dimensional position and yaw orientation. Its novel design enables autonomous takeoff, flight, and landing while maintaining a small, simple form factor. We describe a feedback controller and demonstrate its feasibility in a series of flight tests that display position holding, step response, and path following capabilities. The results indicate that MP2 is capable of controlled autonomous 3D flight with only one actuator.

AB Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), particularly Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are susceptible to safety and security concerns that impend people's lives. Nothing like manually controlled vehicles, the safekeeping of communications and computing constituents of AVs can be threatened using sophisticated hacking techniques, consequently disrupting AVs from the operative usage in our daily life routines. Once manually controlled vehicles are linked to the Internet, so-called the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), they would be misused by cyberattacks. In this paper, we present a multi-stage intrusion detection framework to identify intrusions from ITSs and produce low rate of false alarms. The proposed framework can automatically distinguish intrusions in real-time. The proposed framework is based on normal state-based and a deep learning-centered bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to efficiently discover intrusions from the fundamental network gateways and communication networks of AVs. The designed framework is evaluated through two benchmark datasources, that is, the UNSWNB-15 datasource for exterior network communications and the car hacking datasource for in-vehicle communications. The outcomes indicated that the proposed framework achieves high performance that outperforms various current state-of-the-art systems with an accuracy rate of 98.88% for the UNSWNB-15 dataset and 99.11% for the car hacking dataset. Besides, the proposed framework is furthermore capable to detect zero-day (concealed) outbreaks from IoVs networks.

AB A 3D model is an interesting technology used to realize the smooth flow of traffic and plays an important role in autonomous driving. This paper proposes an efficient and new approach monitoring urban transportation and traffic movements using a recently developed 2D, pulsed time-of-flight (TOF) solid-state laser profilometer. To validate the approach, five different vehicle speeds were used in an experiment. An analysis of the results showed that the profilometer has great potential for creating a 3D model of a moving vehicle at all urban speeds, even though the resolution of the digital 3D imaging decreased as the speed increased, and precisely achieved the determination of the dimensions of the vehicle. The procedure is not restricted to vehicles; it also has potential for low-speed vehicles found on building and infrastructure constructions and worksites, such as excavators and bulldozers. In the future, the 3D images of a moving vehicle will be a key component of building information modeling (BIM) for monitoring the flow of road traffic.

AB This study combines applied mathematics, visual analysis technology, information science with an approach of Scientometrics to systematically analyze the development status, research distribution and future trend of intelligent vehicles research. A total number of 3933 published paper index by SCIE and SSCI from 2000 to 2019 are researched based on Mapping Knowledge Domain (MKD) and Scientometrics approaches. Firstly, this paper analyzes the literature content in the field of intelligent vehicles by including the literature number, literature productive countries, research organization, co-authorship of main research groups and the journals from which the articles are mainly sourced. Then, co-citation analysis is used to obtain five major research directions in the field of intelligent vehicles, which include "system framework", "internet of vehicles", "intersection control algorithms", "influence on traffic flow", and "policies and barriers", respectively. The keyword co-occurrence analysis is applied to identify four dominant clusters: "planning and control system", "autonomous vehicle questionnaire", "sensor and vision", and "connected vehicles". Finally, we divide burst keywords into three phases according to the publication date to show more clearly the change of research focus and direction over time.

AB The development of autonomous visual guidance for land vehicles at UniBwM is reviewed. An initial breakthrough in performance level was achieved in 1986 by combined differential/integral representations of the road skeleton and the vehicle state in conjunction with recursive estimation techniques (4-D approach). Feedback control laws allowed easy implementation of reactive behavior; by complementing this approach with generic feedforward control-time histories for several mission elements, a capability for mission performance is introduced. Lane changes, turn-offs and handling forks in the road are the most essential such elements; in conjunction with a capability for landmark recognition and digital map reading this allows the autonomous performance of entire missions. Recently developed capabilities of the VaMoRs test vehicle are discussed.

AB This study addresses vision-based underwater navigation techniques to automate underwater intervention tasks with robotic vehicles. A systematic procedure of model-referenced pose estimation is introduced to obtain the relative pose information between the underwater vehicle and the underwater structures whose geometry and shape are known. The vision-based pose estimation combined with inertial navigation enables underwater robots to navigate precisely around underwater structures for challenging underwater intervention tasks such as subsea construction, maintenance, and inspection. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, a set of experiments were carried out in a test tank using an autonomous underwater vehicle.

AB Driverless vehicles have the potential to significantly affect the transport system, society, and environment. However, there are still many unanswered questions regarding what the development will look like, and there are several contradictory forces. This paper addresses the effects of driverless vehicles by combining the results from 26 simulation studies. Each simulation study focuses on a particular case, e.g. a certain mobility concept or geographical region. By combining and analysing the results from the 26 simulation studies, an overall picture of the effects of driverless vehicles is presented. In the paper, the following perspectives are considered: what types of application of driverless vehicles have been studied in literature; what effects these simulation studies predict; and what research gaps still exist related to the effects of driverless vehicles. The analysis shows that it is primarily driverless taxi applications in urban areas that have been studied. Some parameters, such as trip cost and waiting time, show small variations between the simulation studies. Other parameters, such as vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT), show larger variations and depend heavily on the assumptions concerning value of time and level of sharing. To increase the understanding of system level effects of driverless vehicles, simulations of more complex applications and aspects such as land use, congestion and energy consumption are considered.

AB Thanks to the advent of new technologies and higher real-time computational capabilities, the use of unmanned vehicles in the marine domain has received a significant boost in the last decade. Ocean and seabed sampling, missions in dangerous areas, and civilian security are only a few of the large number of applications which currently benefit from unmanned vehicles. One of the most actively studied topic is their full autonomy; i.e., the design of marine vehicles capable of pursuing a task while reacting to the changes of the environment without the intervention of humans, not even remotely. Environmental dynamicity may consist of variations of currents, the presence of unknown obstacles, and attacks from adversaries (e.g., pirates). To achieve autonomy in such highly dynamic uncertain conditions, many types of autonomous path planning problems need to be solved. There has thus been a commensurate number of approaches and methods to optimize this kind of path planning. This work focuses on game-theoretic approaches and provides a wide overview of the current state of the art, along with future directions.

AB The use of Hybrid intelligent Systems (HIS) is becoming necessary to bring the behavior of Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles (IAV) near to that of humans in terms of recognition, learning, decision making and action. First, combining Expert Systems (ES), Neural Networks (NN) and Fuzzy Logic (FL) to provide IAV with more autonomy and intelligence is discussed. Second, a neuro-fuzzy expert system E_SCO_V (Expert System COntrolling Vehicles) for the IAV obstacle avoidance behavior is suggested. Indeed, E_S_CO_V improves Maeda's obstacle avoidance approach by handling size and number of obstacles, on the one hand. On the other hand, the fuzzy reasoning and inference to decide static and dynamic obstacle danger degrees are carried out using Fuzzy Neural Networks (FNN_1) and (FNN_2) respectively, while the decision table of avoidance direction is carried out using NN_3. Third, simulation results illustrate the efficiency of E_S_CO_V in handling several obstacles with different sizes and display its ability to achieve an intelligent obstacle avoidance behavior. Finally, a discussion dealing with the application of E_S_CO_V to actual vehicles is given.

ID STABILITY; SYSTEMS
AB Vehicle platooning has been a major research topic in recent years because of its ability to reduce fuel consumption, enhance road traffic safety and utilize the road more efficiently. A practical and applicable platoon merging maneuver is the key to forming new platoons while ensuring safety and economy. This study proposes merging strategies that consider both safe space and acceleration limitations for two adjacent platoons comprising connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). The distributed model predictive control (DMPC) algorithm is adopted to design a DMPC2 controller, which includes 1) a space-making DMPC controller that controls the vehicles in one platoon, i.e. the target platoon, to make space for the vehicles in a second platoon, i.e. the merge platoon, and 2) a DMPC platoon controller that controls the merging vehicles to fill in the space in the target platoon. The former considers the explicit acceleration constraint of the vehicle, making the generated trajectory more feasible, and the latter controls the merge platoon to perform an overall mergence, which reduces the complexity of the merge problem. The low computation load of DMPC makes online computing and real-time control possible in practical scenarios. A simulation study is conducted with different scenarios and parameters, and the results demonstrate that the proposed strategy is more feasible and efficient, and less time-consuming than the existing state-of-the-art methods and have the advantages of taking safety distance and control input constraints into account.

AB Dynamic vehicle detection is of great significance for the safety of autonomous vehicles and the formulation of subsequent driving strategies. A pose-estimation algorithm, namely, the pose estimation with convex-hull model (PE-CHM), is proposed in this paper, and introduced in the dynamic vehicle detection system. In PE-CHM, the convex hull of the object's point-clouds is first extracted and the most fitted bounding box is determined by a multifactor objective function. Next, the center position of the target is inferred according to the location and direction of the target. With the obtained bounding box and the position inference, the pose of the target is determined, which reduces the interference of the missing contour on pose estimation. Finally, three experiments were performed to validate the performance of the proposed PE-CHM method. Compared with several typical model-based methods, PE-CHM can implement dynamic vehicle detection faster, which reduces the amount of calculation on the basis of ensuring detection efficiency.

AB Autonomous landing is one of the key technologies for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) which can improve task flexibility in various fields. In this paper, a vision-based autonomous landing strategy is proposed for a quadrotor micro-UAV based on a novel camera view angle conversion method, fast landing marker detection, and an autonomous guidance approach. The front-view camera of the micro-UAV video is first modified by a new strategy to obtain a top-down view. By this means, the landing marker can be captured by the onboard camera of the micro-UAV and is then detected by the YOLOv5 algorithm in real time. The central coordinate of the landing marker is estimated and used to generate the guidance commands for the flight controller. After that, the guidance commands are sent by the ground station to perform the landing task of the UAV. Finally, the flight experiments using DJI Tello UAV are conducted outdoors and indoors, respectively. The original UAV platform is modified using the proposed camera view angle-changing strategy so that the top-down view can be achieved for performing the landing mission. The experimental results show that the proposed landing marker detection algorithm and landing guidance strategy can complete the autonomous landing task of the micro-UAV efficiently.

AB This paper discusses cooperative path-planning and tracking controller for autonomous vehicles using a distributed model predictive control approach. Mixed-integer quadratic programming approach is used for optimal trajectory generation using a linear model predictive control for path-tracking. Cooperative behaviour is introduced by broadcasting the planned trajectories of two connected automated vehicles. The controller generates steering and torque inputs. The steering and drive motor actuator constraints are incorporated in the control law. Computational simulations are performed to evaluate the controller for vehicle models of varying complexities. A 12-degrees-of-freedom vehicle model is developed and is subsequently linearised to be used as the plant model for the linearised model predictive control-based tracking controller. The model behaviour is compared against the kinematic, bicycle and the sophisticated high-fidelity multi-body dynamics CarSim model of the vehicle. Vehicle trajectories used for tracking are longitudinal and lateral positions, velocities and yaw rate. A cooperative obstacle avoidance manoeuvre is performed at different speeds using a co-simulation between the controller model in Simulink and the high-fidelity vehicle model in CarSim. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Due to the significant increase in the use of autonomous car technology, it is essential to integrate this technology with high-precision digital map data containing more precise and accurate roadway information, as compared to existing conventional map resources, to ensure the safety of self-driving operations. While existing map technologies may assist vehicles in identifying their locations via Global Positioning System, it is however difficult to update the environmental changes of roadways in these maps. Roadway vision algorithms can be useful for building autonomous vehicles that can avoid accidents and detect real-time location changes. We incorporate a hybrid architectural design that combines unsupervised classification of vision data with supervised joint fusion classification to achieve a better noise-resistant algorithm. We identify, via a deep learning approach, an intelligent hybrid fusion algorithm for fusing multimodal vision feature data for roadway classifications and characterize its improvement in accuracy over unsupervised identifications using image processing and supervised vision classifiers. We analyzed over 93,000 vision frame data collected from a test vehicle in real roadways. The performance indicators of the proposed hybrid fusion algorithm are successfully evaluated for the generation of roadway digital maps for autonomous vehicles, with a recall of 0.94, precision of 0.96, and accuracy of 0.92.

   The presented method can be used as a real-time trajectory following algorithm for autonomous vehicles using prediction based on lookahead information.
   Reinforcement learning-based approaches are widely studied in the literature for solving different control tasks for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles, from which this paper deals with the problem of lateral control of a dynamic nonlinear vehicle model, performing the task of lane-keeping. In this area, the appropriate formulation of the goals and environment information is crucial, for which the research outlines the importance of lookahead information, enabling to accomplish maneuvers with complex trajectories. Another critical part is the real-time manner of the problem. On the one hand, optimization or search based methods, such as the presented Monte Carlo Tree Search method, can solve the problem with the trade-off of high numerical complexity. On the other hand, single Reinforcement Learning agents struggle to learn these tasks with high performance, though they have the advantage that after the training process, they can operate in a real-time manner. Two planning agent structures are proposed in the paper to resolve this duality, where the machine learning agents aid the tree search algorithm. As a result, the combined solution provides high performance and low computational needs.

ID STEERING CONTROL
AB Path tracking is an essential task for autonomous vehicles (AV), for which controllers are designed to issue commands so that the AV will follow the planned path properly to ensure operational safety, comfort, and efficiency. While solving the time-varying nonlinear vehicle dynamic problem is still challenging today, deep neural network (NN) methods, with their capability to deal with nonlinear systems, provide an alternative approach to tackle the difficulties. This study explores the potential of using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for vehicle control and applies it to the path tracking task. In this study, proximal policy optimization (PPO) is selected as the DRL algorithm and is combined with the conventional pure pursuit (PP) method to structure the vehicle controller architecture. The PP method is used to generate a baseline steering control command, and the PPO is used to derive a correction command to mitigate the inaccuracy associated with the baseline from PP. The blend of the two controllers makes the overall operation more robust and adaptive and attains the optimality to improve tracking performance. In this paper, the structure, settings and training process of the PPO are described. Simulation experiments are carried out based on the proposed methodology, and the results show that the path tracking capability in a low-speed driving condition is significantly enhanced.

TI Underwater Environment SDAP Method Using Multi Single-Beam Sonars
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING

DT Article
AB A new autopilot system for unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) using multi-single-beam sonars is proposed for environmental exploration. The proposed autopilot system is known as simultaneous detection and patrolling (SDAP), which addresses two fundamental challenges: autonomous guidance and control. Autonomous guidance, autonomous path planning, and target tracking are based on the desired reference path which is reconstructed from the sonar data collected from the environmental contour with the predefined safety distance. The reference path is first estimated by using a support vector clustering inertia method and then refined by Bezier curves in order to satisfy the inertia property of the UUV. Differential geometry feedback linearization method is used to guide the vehicle entering into the predefined path while finite predictive stable inversion control algorithmis employed for autonomous target approaching. The experimental results from sea trials have demonstrated that the proposed system can provide satisfactory performance implying its great potential for future underwater exploration tasks.

ID RELOCATION; VEHICLES; TRANSPORTATION
AB When considering autonomous mobility on demand (AMoD) trends, it is probably safe to assume that they will have a large market share in the near future. In the introductory phases, users of current non-autonomous mobility on demand services such as ride-hailing and carsharing are expected to be among the first users of AMoD systems. The research presented in this paper aims to estimate fares for an AMoD system in this early stages based on rental and financial data provided by a free-floating CS provider. It demonstrates that an autonomous taxi (aTaxi) model requires less vehicles to serve the same demand resulting in the possibility to lower fares. In our model, user behavior is represented by defining three maximal waiting times and three monetary values reflecting their dissatisfaction in the case, where they cannot be served in due time. Two bipartite optimization problems for vehicle-to-user and relocation assignments build the core of the introduced aTaxi model. Fleet size and relocation parameters are chosen according to a utility function representing profit and opportunity costs of users not being served. We compute the reduction in fares to break-even with the current CS profit. Results of a case-study in Munich, Germany, indicate that one aTaxi can replace 2.8-3.7 CS vehicles. The aTaxi operator can therefore reduce fares by 29%-35% to achieve the same profit assuming the same cost structures as in free-floating CS.

AB Many existing advanced deep learning-based autonomous systems have recently been used for autonomous vehicles. In general, a deep learning-based visual perception system heavily relies on visual perception to recognize and localize dynamic interest objects (e.g., pedestrians and cars) and indicative traffic signs and lights to assist autonomous vehicles in maneuvering safely. However, the performance of existing object recognition algorithms could degrade significantly under some adverse and challenging scenarios including rainy, foggy, and rainy night conditions. The raindrops, light reflection, and low illumination pose a great challenge to robust object recognition. Thus, A robust and accurate autonomous driving system has attracted growing attention from the computer vision community. To achieve robust and accurate visual perception, we target to build effective and efficient augmentation and fusion techniques based on visual perception under various adverse conditions. The unpaired image-to-image (I2I) synthesis is integrated for visual perception enhancement and effective synthesis-based augmentation. Besides, we design a two-branch architecture to utilize the information from both the original image and the enhanced image synthesized by I2I. We comprehensively and hierarchically investigate the performance improvement and limitation of the proposed system based on visual recognition tasks and network backbones. An extensive experimental analysis of various adverse weather conditions is also included. The experimental results have demonstrated the proposed system could promote the ability of autonomous vehicles for robust and accurate perception under adverse weather conditions.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) can potentially bring about major changes in cities. Anticipatory planning approaches may provide valuable opportunities for fostering desirable transitions and pre-empting undesirable impacts. This research employs a combination of two methods to define the key policies to support a transition to the desirable driverless urban futures: the backcasting approach and the participatory Q-method. The combination of these techniques aims to identify different viewpoints about policies with the purpose of determining more effective and more acceptable options. The article analyses viewpoints from 20 citizens and 10 experts. The results point to the existence of two main viewpoints about the most and least desirable policies. The first viewpoint centres around increasing pedestrian mobility and promoting a more compact city. The second viewpoint centres around expanding transit-oriented development (TOD) and new networks of green spaces. Meanwhile, support for regulation-oriented policies to discourage the use of private motorised vehicles was relatively low. This research not only sheds light on the different viewpoints on the policies to achieve more desirable urban visions, it also illustrates the tensions and disagreements that may arise in the process of policy making.

AB In this paper, a new model-free adaptive integral sliding-mode-constrained control scheme is presented for autonomous four-wheeled mobile vehicle (4WMV) parking systems. The proposed control strategy includes: 1) online identification for the object model based on a data-driven technique is presented for 4WMV and 2) an integral sliding-mode controller with control input constraints and stability analysis is provided. For online data-driven model identification, a compact-form dynamic linearization-based observer formulation is constructed for 4WMV. For integral sliding-mode controller design, a dynamic antiwindup compensator is introduced to solve integral saturation and actuator saturation problems in the autonomous 4WMV parking system. The designed control scheme only utilizes the body angle and steering angle of the vehicle under the condition that the precise mechanism model of the autonomous 4WMV parking system is not available to us. Finally, simulation comparisons between the model-free adaptive integral sliding-mode-constrained control scheme, PID control, and model-free adaptive control algorithms with coordinate compensation are given for two different vehicles. The simulation results show that a better control performance is achieved with the proposed new sliding-mode controller than the traditional control method when actuator or control input saturation exists in the autonomous 4WMV parking system.

AB Recent years have witnessed rapid advances in autonomous driving technologies. Autonomous vehicles are more likely to be accepted if they drive comfortably to avoid potholes, bumps, and other road damage conditions, especially when there are elderly and disabled passengers on board. Traditionally, sensing road damage conditions is either labor-intensive by field investigation and reporting, or inaccurate by surveillance cameras and driving recorders due to limited perspective. In this paper, we propose GoComfort, a crowdsensing-based framework to provide low-cost and fine-grained comfortable navigation for autonomous vehicles with road damage identification leveraging high-precision road sensing data. First, we propose to exploit city-wide autonomous vehicle fleets as crowdsensing participants, and employ an edge-cloud-hybrid computing paradigm to efficiently collect high-precision road damage-related data, including 3D LiDAR point clouds and street view images. Second, we design an accurate road damage identification model fusing spatial structures of point clouds and texture features of street view images, and use an active learning-based method to address the sparse labels issue. Finally, we devise two comfortable navigation scenarios, i.e., fine-grained road damage avoidance and coarse-grained city-wide navigation, and propose a hierarchical road damage assessment diagram for comfortable route planning. Experiments using real-world road sensing data in Xiamen, China show that our approach identifies road damage conditions with an accuracy of 87.5%, and achieves a user acceptance rate of 93.8% in riding comfort evaluation, outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines.

AB Innovations in the mobility industry such as automated and connected cars could significantly reduce congestion and emissions by allowing the traffic to flow more freely and reducing the number of vehicles according to some researchers. However, the effectiveness of these sustainable product and service innovations is often limited by unexpected changes in consumption: some researchers thus hypothesize that the higher comfort and improved quality of time in driverless cars could lead to an increase in demand for driving with autonomous vehicles. So far, there is a lack of empirical evidence supporting either one or other of these hypotheses. To analyze the influence of autonomous driving on mobility behavior and to uncover user preferences, which serve as indicators for future travel mode choices, we conducted an online survey with a paired comparison of current and future travel modes with 302 participants in Germany. The results do not confirm the hypothesis that ownership will become an outdated model in the future. Instead they suggest that private cars, whether conventional or fully automated, will remain the preferred travel mode. At the same time, carsharing will benefit from full automation more than private cars. However, the findings indicate that the growth of carsharing will mainly be at the expense of public transport, showing that more emphasis should be placed in making public transport more attractive if sustainable mobility is to be developed.

TI Microsimulation of Demand and Supply of Autonomous Mobility On Demand
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Agent-based models have gained wide acceptance in transportation planning because with increasing computational power, large-scale people centric mobility simulations are possible. Several modeling efforts have been reported in the literature on the demand side (with sophisticated activity-based models that focus on an individual's day activity patterns) and on the supply side (with detailed representation of network dynamics through simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment models). This paper proposes an extension to a state-of-the-art integrated agent-based demand and supply model SimMobility for the design and evaluation of autonomous vehicle systems. SimMobility integrates various mobility sensitive behavioral models in a multiple time-scale structure comprising three simulation levels: (a) a long-term level that captures land use and economic activity, with special emphasis on accessibility; (b) a midterm level that handles agents' activities and travel patterns; and (c) a short-term level that simulates movement of agents, operational systems, and decisions at a microscopic granularity. In that context, this paper proposes several extensions at the short-term and midterm levels to model and simulate autonomous vehicle systems and their effects on travel behavior. To showcase these features, the first-cut results of a hypothetical on-demand service with autonomous vehicles in a car-restricted zone of Singapore are presented. SimMobility was successfully used in an integrated manner to test and assess the performance of different autonomous vehicle fleet sizes and parking station configurations and to uncover changes in individual mobility patterns, specifically in regard to modal shares, routes, and destinations.

TI Reservation Enhanced Autonomous Valet Parking Concerning Practicality

   planning
AB Advances in automotive industry as well as computing technology are making autonomous vehicle (AV) an appealing means of transportation. Vehicles are beyond the traditional source of commute, and leveled up to smart devices with computing capability. As one of the compelling features of AVs, the autonomous valet parking (AVP) allows for navigating and parking the car automatically without human interventions. Within this realm, long-range AVP (LAVP) extends auto-parking to a much larger scale compared to its short-range counterparts. It is worth noting that AV mobility is a pivotal concern with LAVP, involving dynamic patterns related to spatial-temporal features, such as varied parking and drop-off (or pick-up) demands with diverse customer journey planning. We herein target such critical decision-making on where to park and where to drop/pick-up upon customer requirements during their journeys. Concerning in practice that car parks are equipped with limited parking space, we thus introduce parking reservations and enable accurate estimations on future parking states. An efficient LAVP service framework enhanced with parking reservations is then proposed. Benefited from the intelligent predictions, parking load can be accurately predicted and greatly alleviated at individual car parks, thereby avoiding overcrowding effectively. Results show that significant performance gains can he achieved under the proposed scheme by comparing to other benchmarks, with respect to greatly reduced waiting duration for available parking space, as well as enhanced customer experiences in terms of reduced traveling period, etc. In particular, the number of parked vehicles across the network can be effectively balanced.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AV) have advanced considerably over the past decade and their potential to reduce road accidents is without equal. That said, the evolution towards fully automated driving will be accompanied by new and unfamiliar risks. The deployment of AVs hinges on the premise that they are considerably safer than human drivers. However, the ability of manufacturers, insurers and regulators to quantifiably demonstrate this risk reduction, relative to humans, presents a major barrier. Based on accident rates, it will likely take hundreds of millions of autonomous miles to derive statistically meaningful results. This paper addresses this issue and proposes a novel means of quantifying AV accident risks by benchmarking against a more familiar and quantifiable risk - Human Behaviour. This method is used to proactively quantify AV safety relative to human drivers. Currently, anomalous driving behaviour stems from human susceptibilities such as fatigue or aggression. We exploit this observation and explore AV driving behaviour where driving anomalies are symptoms of technology errors. The comparative behaviours of AV and safe human driving can be used to measure AV accident risk. An end-to-end model AV is simulated using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to compare human and AV driving behaviours. Using a machine learning technique called Gaussian Processes (GP), contextual driving anomalies are detected, the frequency and severity of which are used to derive a risk score. This paper offers a starting point for addressing the challenges surrounding AV risk modelling.

AB Smart transportation shall address utility waste, traffic congestion, and air pollution problems with least human intervention in future smart cities. To realize the sustainable operation of smart transportation, we leverage solar-harvesting charging stations and rooftops to power electric autonomous vehicles(AVs) solely via design. With a fixed budget, our framework first optimizes the locations of charging stations based on historical spatial-temporal solar energy distribution and usage patterns, achieving (2+e) factor to the optimal. Then a stochastic algorithm is proposed to update the locations online to adapt to any shift in the distribution. Based on the deployment, a strategy is developed to assign energy requests in order to minimize their traveling distance to stations while not depleting their energy storage. Equipped with extra harvesting capability, we also optimize route planning to achieve a reasonable balance between energy consumed and harvested en-route. As a promising application, utility optimization of shared electric AVs is discussed, and (2k+1)-approx algorithm is proposed to manage $k$k vehicles simultaneously. Our extensive simulations demonstrate the algorithm can approach the optimal solution within 10-15% approximation error, improve the operating range of vehicles by up to 2-3 times, and improve the utility by more than 50% compared to other competitive strategies.

AB The inherent dynamism of recent technological advancements in intelligent vehicles has seen multitudes of noteworthy security concerns regarding interactions and data. As future mobility embraces the concept of vehicles-to-everything, it exacerbates security complexities and challenges concerning dynamism, adaptiveness, and self-awareness. It calls for a transition from security measures relying on static approaches and implementations. Therefore, to address this transition, this work proposes a hierarchical self-aware security architecture that effectively establishes accountability at the system level and further illustrates why such a proposed security architecture is relevant to intelligent vehicles. The article provides (1) a comprehensive understanding of the self-aware security concept, with emphasis on its hierarchical security architecture that enables system-level accountability, and (2) a deep dive into each layer supported by algorithms and a security-specific in-vehicle black box with external virtual security operation center (VSOC) interactions. In contrast to the present in-vehicle security measures, this architecture introduces characteristics and properties that enact self-awareness through system-level accountability. It implements hierarchical layers that enable real-time monitoring, analysis, decision-making, and in-vehicle and remote site integration regarding security-related decisions and activities.

AB This letter reports on a TIV DHW (decentralized and hybrid workshop) that explores the prospective influence of ChatGPT on research and development in intelligent vehicles. To assess the update capabilities of ChatGPT, we conducted tests involving both basic and technically relevant questions. Our preliminary testing revealed that ChatGPT's information can be updated and corrected at one time, but it may take some time for the changes to be reflected in ChatGPT's responses, so it may not always possess the latest knowledge regarding specific topics. We further discuss the prospective influence of ChatGPT on the field of intelligent vehicles, particularly possible applications of ChatGPT in areas like autonomous driving, human-vehicle interaction, and intelligent transportation systems, highlighting challenges and opportunities associated with these applications. Additionally, we address technical questions, such as the feasibility of training intelligent vehicles using the same methods as ChatGPT and the reflection of the intelligence of intelligent vehicles in the context of human-machine shared control. In conclusion, this letter presents a preliminary exploration of the potential of ChatGPT for intelligent vehicle research, from an IEEE TIV perspective, acknowledging the limitations and uncertainties of this emerging technology.

AB In recent years, there have been major advances in the development of new and more powerful perception systems for agriculture, such as computer-vision and global positioning systems. Due to these advances, the automation of agricultural tasks has received an important stimulus, especially in the area of selective weed control where high precision is essential for the proper use of resources and the implementation of more efficient treatments. Such autonomous agricultural systems incorporate and integrate perception systems for acquiring information from the environment, decision-making systems for interpreting and analyzing such information, and actuation systems that are responsible for performing the agricultural operations. These systems consist of different sensors, actuators, and computers that work synchronously in a specific architecture for the intended purpose. The main contribution of this paper is the selection, arrangement, integration, and synchronization of these systems to form a whole autonomous vehicle for agricultural applications. This type of vehicle has attracted growing interest, not only for researchers but also for manufacturers and farmers. The experimental results demonstrate the success and performance of the integrated system in guidance and weed control tasks in a maize field, indicating its utility and efficiency. The whole system is sufficiently flexible for use in other agricultural tasks with little effort and is another important contribution in the field of autonomous agricultural vehicles.

AB Humans have evolved the cognitive ability to perceive and associate dominance, masculinity, and emotions to animals and humans of larger sizes. Previous research has shown that humans are able to anthropomorphize nonbiological objects such as cars and attribute different characteristics to them. We hypothesized that larger vehicles are perceived and processed in a similar fashion as other biological agents, and are therefore considered more aggressive, dominant, and masculine compared to smaller vehicles. This study investigated the effect of vehicles' size on the perception of dominance, masculinity, anger, and hostility. A total of 221 individuals (139 men and 82 women) participated in the study and rated vehicles of large and small sizes on four dimensions of Submissive-Dominant, Angry-Happy, Masculine-Feminine, and Hostile-Friendly. Results showed that participants rated larger vehicles as more dominant, angry, hostile, and masculine than smaller vehicles, supporting the proposal that, similar to biological agents, large vehicles are more threatening and are associated with higher dominance. Moreover, while men and women responded to size in a similar manner, the ratings of anger, masculinity, and hostility for large vehicles increased with the age of participants. The implications of this work are considered, including ways to enhance the social acceptance of autonomous vehicles.

AB In this paper, we propose a stochastic differential equation-based exploration algorithm to enable exploration in three-dimensional indoor environments with a payload-constrained micro-aerial vehicle (MAV). We are able to address computation, memory, and sensor limitations by using a map representation which is dense for the known occupied space but sparse for the free space. We determine regions for further exploration based on the evolution of a stochastic differential equation that simulates the expansion of a system of particles with Newtonian dynamics. The regions of most significant particle expansion correlate to unexplored space. After identifying and processing these regions, the autonomous MAV navigates to these locations to enable fully autonomous exploration. The performance of the approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations and experimental results in single- and multi-floor indoor experiments.

AB Recently, in various fields, research into the path tracking of autonomous vehicles and automated guided vehicles has been conducted to improve worker safety, convenience, and work efficiency. For path tracking of various systems applied to autonomous driving technology, it is necessary to recognize the surrounding environment, determine technology accordingly, and develop control methods. Various sensors and artificial-intelligence-based perception methods have limitations in that they must learn a large amount of data. Therefore, a particle-filter-based path tracking algorithm using a monocular camera was used for the recognition of target RGB. The path tracking errors were calculated and a linear-quadratic-regulator-based desired steering angle were derived. The autonomous trucks were steered and driven using a pulse-width-modulation-based steering and driving motor. Based on an autonomous truck with a single steering and driving module, it was verified that the path tracking could be used in three evaluation scenarios. To compare the LQR-based path tracking control performance proposed in this paper, an elliptical path tracking scenario using a conventional sliding mode control with robust control performance was performed. The results show that the RMS of the lateral preview error of the SMC was approximately 18% larger than that of the LQR-based method.

AB The highway on-ramp merging area is one of the major sections that form traffic bottlenecks. In a connected vehicle environment, V2V and V2I technologies enable real-time exchange of information, including position, speed, and acceleration. To improve the efficiency of vehicle merging at the on-ramp, this study proposes a cooperative merging control strategy for network-connected autonomous vehicles. First, the central controller designs the merging sequence and safety space for vehicles passing through the confluence point. Then, a trajectory optimization model was constructed based on vehicle longitudinal dynamics, and the PMP algorithm was used to determine the optimal control input. Finally, all vehicles follow the optimal trajectory so that the ramp vehicles merge smoothly into the mainline. Simulations verify that the proposed algorithm performs better than FIFO, with 13.2% energy savings, 41.4% increase in average speed, and 50.4% reduction in travel time over the uncontrolled merging scenario. The method is further applied to different traffic flow conditions and the results show that it can significantly improve traffic safety and mobility, while effectively reducing vehicle energy consumption. However, the traffic operation improvement is not satisfactory under low traffic demand.

AB Intelligent decision control is one key issue of automated vehicles. Complex dynamic traffic flow and multi-requirement of passengers including vehicle safety, comfort, vehicle efficiency bring about tremendous challenges to vehicle decision making. Overtaking maneuver is a demanding task due to its large potential of traffic collision. Therefore, this paper proposes a fuzzy-inference-based reinforcement learning (FIRL) approach of autonomous overtaking decision making. Firstly, the problem of overtaking is formulated as a multi-objective Markov decision process (MDP) considering vehicle safety, driving comfort, and vehicle efficiency. Secondly, a temporal difference learning based on dynamic fuzzy (DF-TDL) is presented to learn optimized policies for autonomous overtaking decision making. Fuzzy inference is introduced to deal with continuous states and boost learning process. The RL algorithm decides whether to overtake or not based on the learned policies. Then, the automated vehicle executes local path planning and tracking. Furthermore, a simulation platform based on simulation of urban mobility (SUMO) is established to generate the random training data, that is, various traffic flows for algorithm iterative learning and validate the proposed method, extensive test results demonstrate the effectiveness of the overtaking decision-making method.

TI A New Vehicle Localization Scheme Based on Combined Optical Camera
   Communication and Photogrammetry
SO MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB The demand for autonomous vehicles is increasing gradually owing to their enormous potential benefits. However, several challenges, such as vehicle localization, are involved in the development of autonomous vehicles. A simple and secure algorithm for vehicle positioning is proposed herein without massively modifying the existing transportation infrastructure. For vehicle localization, vehicles on the road are classified into two categories: host vehicles (HVs) are the ones used to estimate other vehicles' positions and forwarding vehicles (FVs) are the ones that move in front of the HVs. The FV transmits modulated data from the tail (or back) light, and the camera of the HV receives that signal using optical camera communication (OCC). In addition, the streetlight (SL) data are considered to ensure the position accuracy of the HV. Determining the HV position minimizes the relative position variation between the HV and FV. Using photogrammetry, the distance between FV or SL and the camera of the HV is calculated by measuring the occupied image area on the image sensor. Comparing the change in distance between HV and SLs with the change in distance between HV and FV, the positions of FVs are determined. The performance of the proposed technique is analyzed, and the results indicate a significant improvement in performance. The experimental distance measurement validated the feasibility of the proposed scheme.

AB The on-ramp merging on expressway is one of the hotspots of research, which usually leads to reduced traffic efficiency, increased risk of collision, and increased fuel consumption. However, most current on-ramp merging strategies coordinate merging by controlling upstream vehicles, which adversely effects on the main-lane traffic after the merging position (MP). To address this problem, this paper proposes an on-ramp merging strategy for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) based on the collaboration of downstream main-lane vehicles and on-ramp vehicles. First, we propose a necessary communication topology to meet the information needs of vehicle collaboration in this strategy. Then, the downstream vehicles of the MP act using the feedback from the upstream vehicles of the MP to cooperate with the on-ramp vehicles. Meanwhile, in order to ensure the safe, we transform the vehicle control problem in the strategy into an optimization problem with state and input constraints, and the optimal solution is calculated using model predictive control (MPC). Finally, we use simulation experiments to verify, compare and analyze the proposed strategy. Simulation results show that the strategy is effective in preventing the deterioration of traffic conditions caused by merging behavior and has advantages in improving merging efficiency, reducing fuel consumption, and improving comfort.

AB The safe and reliable navigation of such autonomous systems as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is a complex open problem in robotics, where a robotic system must simultaneously do many tasks of perception, control and localization. This task is especially complicated when working in an uncontrolled, unpredictable environment, for example, on city streets, in wooded areas, etc. In these cases, the autonomous agent must not only be guided to avoid collisions, but also interact safely with other agents in the environment. The developed system allows navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles in difficult environmental conditions. The results of training and the operation of the autonomous navigation system in the forest are presented. The system finds and follows the paths that are fairly difficult to distinguish. The results of field experiments are presented. Presentation of the model is presented on the youtube.com channel.

AB As deep neural networks are spreading to almost all fields, flight systems in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) domain are undergoing various transitions to intelligent systems. Among these transitions-in a bid to reduce flight risk-is the active research domain of autonomous navigation for intelligent UAVs. The autonomous trail-following flight system that this letter introduces can safely consolidate flight control and mission control within the latest commercial hardware platform. The resource usage and degradation of pass-through delay in vision-based convolutional neural network workloads show that virtualisation overhead is not significantly negative, and the overall performance of the introduced system is acceptable. Real-time cooperation is also verified as achievable-in that the workloads incur minimal communication delay-between the controls. Finally, the actual field test analysis demonstrates the applicability of our autonomous UAV system, whereby our system controls the UAV to follow the centre of a set trail.

AB Autonomous navigation of micro aerial vehicles in unknown environments not only requires exploring their time-varying surroundings, but also ensuring the complete safety of flights at all times. The current research addresses estimation of the potential exploration value neglect of safety issues, especially in situations with a cluttered environment and no prior knowledge. To address this issue, we propose a vision object-oriented autonomous navigation method for environment exploration, which develops a B-spline function-based local trajectory re-planning algorithm by extracting spatial-structure information and selecting temporary target points. The proposed method is evaluated in a variety of cluttered environments, such as forests, building areas, and mines. The experimental results show that the proposed autonomous navigation system can effectively complete the global trajectory, during which an appropriate safe distance could always be maintained from multiple obstacles in the environment.

AB This paper presents a mission system and the therein implemented algorithms for path planning in a timevarying environment based on graph methods. The basic task of the introduced path planning algorithms is to find a time-optimal path from a defined start position to a goal position with consideration of the time-varying ocean current for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Building on this, additional practice-oriented considerations in planning are discussed in this paper. Such points are the discussion of possible methods to accelerate the algorithms and the determination of the optimal departure time. The solutions and algorithms presented in this paper are focused on path planning requirements for the AUV "SLOCUM Glider". These algorithms are equally applicable to other AUVs or aerial mobile autonomous systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) are revolutionizing the future of urban mobility. This study aims to investigate the effects of artificial intelligence (i.e., autonomy level and anthropomorphic characteristics), human-related, environmental, and societal factors on public trust and acceptance. Structural equation modelling is used to analyze a valid survey sample of 451 participants. Results show that autonomy level can both directly and indirectly (via trust) increase public acceptance; Whereas, anthropomorphic characteristics cannot directly affect public acceptance, but can indirectly increase their acceptance via trust. The other human-related, environmental, and societal factors also positively contribute to public acceptance. Additionally, moderators, including age, gender, income, housing size, COVID-19 history, shared mobility experience, vehicle ownership, and driving experience are also examined. In theory, this study contextualizes the trust-in-automation three-factor model, UTAUT model, and trust theory and includes two domain-specific constructs (i.e., SAV anthropomorphism and SAV autonomy) to study public trust and acceptance towards SAVs. In practice, this study suggests the incorporation of some anthropomorphic features and relatively high autonomy level in SAVs to build public trust and acceptance.

AB The convergence of mechanical, electrical, and advanced ICT technologies, driven by artificial intelligence and 5G vehicle-to-everything (5G-V2X) connectivity, will help to develop high-performance autonomous driving vehicles and services that are usable and convenient for self-driving passengers. Despite widespread research on self-driving, user acceptance remains an essential part of successful market penetration; this forms the motivation behind studies on human factors associated with autonomous shuttle services. We address this by providing a comfortable driving experience while not compromising safety. We focus on the accelerations and jerks of vehicles to reduce the risk of motion sickness and to improve the driving experience for passengers. Furthermore, this study proposes a time-optimal velocity planning method for guaranteeing comfort criteria when an explicit reference path is given. The overall controller and planning method were verified using real-time, software-in-the-loop (SIL) environments for a real-time vehicle dynamics simulation; the performance was then compared with a typical planning approach. The proposed optimized planning shows a relatively better performance and enables a comfortable passenger experience in a self-driving shuttle bus according to the recommended criteria.

AB A method is proposed to achieve lateral stability of an autonomous bicycle with only the rotation of the front wheel. This can be achieved with a classic controller. However, if the energy consumption of the bicycle also has to be minimized, this solution is not valid. To solve this problem, an adaptive controller has been designed, which modifies its gains according to the bicycle's forward velocity, adapting its response with minimum energy consumption and satisfying the design specifications. The study demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed control, achieving an energy saving of 73.8% in trajectory tracking with respect to a conventional proportional-integral (PI) controller. These results show the importance of designing energy-efficient controllers, not only for autonomous vehicles but also for any automatic system where the energy consumption can be minimized.

AB This study presents a solution for the integrated longitudinal and lateral control problem of urban autonomous vehicles. It is based on a gain-scheduling linear parameter-varying (LPV) control approach combined with the use of an Unknown Input Observer (UIO) for estimating the vehicle states and friction force. Two gain-scheduling LPV controllers are used in cascade configuration that use the kinematic and dynamic vehicle models and the friction and observed states provided by the Unknown Input Observer (UIO). The LPV-UIO is designed in an optimal manner by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). On the other hand, the design of the kinematic and dynamic controllers lead to solve separately two LPV-Linear Quadratic Regulator problems formulated also in LMI form. The UIO allows to improve the control response in disturbance affected scenarios by estimating and compensating the friction force. The proposed scheme has been integrated with a trajectory generation module and tested in a simulated scenario. A comparative study is also presented considering the cases that the friction force estimation is used or not to show its usefulness.

AB Autonomous vehicle trajectory planning method based on the driving risk field is one of the current research hotspots. Currently, mainstream driving risk field models (DRFM) rarely consider basic factors such as vehicle geometry and heading angle, and ignore the impact of driving behavior characteristics on the driving risk field, the accuracy of safety assessment needs to be improved. Therefore, this paper proposes an extended driving risk field model (EDRFM) that considers geometric dimensions, heading angle, and driving behavior characteristics, and provides the basis for determining geometric dimensions and shape parameters, expanding the applicability of the DRFM. On this basis, EDRFM is applied to vehicle trajectory planning, and it is found that the target trajectory (denoted as P1) obtained using EDRFM is not achievable and the vehicle is unstable. This paper further proposes an arc correction method considering vehicle dynamics constraints to correct P1 to get P2. To ensure that the trajectory planning results meet the driving stability and motion of the vehicle. The results show that the EDRFM model considering arc correction can effectively complete vehicle trajectory planning tasks in complex scenes, and ensure the feasibility of trajectory planning and vehicle driving stability.

AB It is an effective way to execute a complicated mission by cooperating unmanned vehicles. This paper focuses on a search- and-track (SAT) mission for an underwater target, and the mission is implemented by combining an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). In the cooperative path planning model, the mission is divided into the search phase and the track phase, and the goals of the two phases are to maximize the search space and minimize the terminal error respectively. The constraints contain the maneuverability of vehicles and communication ranges between vehicles. Strategies based on random simulation experiments and asynchronous planning are developed to design the cooperative path planning algorithm in the two phases, and the paths are generated by an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm in a centralized or a distributed mode. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can deal with different situations. The UAV & USV & AUV system is superior to the USV & AUV system in the SAT mission.

AB Autonomous driving technology plays an essential role in reducing road traffic accidents and ensuring more convenience while driving, so it has been widely studied in industrial and academic communities. The lane-changing decision-making process is challenging but critical for ensuring autonomous vehicles' (AVs) safe and smooth maneuvering. This paper presents a closed-loop lane-changing behavioral decision-making framework suitable for AVs in fully autonomous driving environments to achieve both safety and high efficiency. The framework is based on a complete information non-cooperative game theory. Moreover, we attempt to introduce human driver-specific driving styles (reflected by aggressiveness types) and micro-interaction behaviors for both sides of the game in this model, enabling users to understand, adapt, and utilize intelligent lane-changing techniques. Additionally, a model predictive control controller based on the host-vehicle (HV) driving risk field (DRF) is proposed. The controller's optimizer is used to find the optimal path with the lowest driving risk by using its optimizer and simultaneously adjusting its control variables to track the path. The method can synchronize path planning and motion control and provide real-time vehicle state feedback to the decision-making module. Simulations in several typical traffic scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB The three-dimensional trajectory tracking of an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) under the complex unknowns including model uncertainties and time-varying disturbances is studied. The reference pitch angle and yaw angle are designed in kinematics, based on the time-varying reference trajectory. Dynamics controllers are developed by incorporating the first-order filter into the dynamic surface control (DSC), which simplifies the design process and overcome differential explosion in the traditional backstepping. To reduce the influence of the complex unknowns, an adaptive fuzzy-based DSC scheme is employed to identify the lumped disturbances with arbitrary accuracy and further enhance system robustness. Lyapunov stability analysis demonstrates that tracking errors are bounded and converge to an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of zero. Finally, simulation studies and comparisons with DSC scheme are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme.

AB The increased urbanization and the drive for realizing smart cities have motivated extensive research and development in the realm of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) in order to deal with the increased traffic intensity. Yet, the scope of ITS is not limited to vehicles, as pedestrians are special road users that play an important role in affecting traffic, road infrastructure, and vehicle design. Pedestrians are deemed to be the most vulnerable road users and are the major sufferers of road-incident fatalities and injuries each year. Therefore, quite a few studies have focused on pedestrian's support and safety. On the other hand, due to imperceptible behavior, a pedestrian may also negatively impact traffic efficiency and can thus be viewed as an obstacle for fully realizing the advantages of ITS. In addition, more issues related to pedestrians have been raised with the emergence of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). In this paper, we discuss different issues related to pedestrians as road users. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive survey and classification of the different solutions of pedestrian protection. Finally, we highlight technical gaps and point out possible future research directions.

AB This paper studies the leader-following formation control problem of multiple underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) under uncertain dynamics and limited control torques. A multi-layer neural network-based estimation model is designed to handle the unknown follower dynamics. The backstepping approach, a neural estimation model, as well as a saturation function, are employed to propose a bounded formation control law. Then, a Lyapunov-based stability analysis ensures a maximum bound for all the closed-loop system variables and guarantees that the formation errors between vehicles ultimately converge to a bounded compact set. The outstanding properties of the designed controller are highlighted as follows. First, only the leader position and given formation are required without any leader velocity information requirement. Second, update laws of the neural network weight are extracted using the estimation errors instead of tracking ones, which can effectively enhance the transient characteristics of the control system. Third, the control torques are bounded within predefined bounds. At the end, extensive simulations are given for a number of AUVs to verify the efficiency of the presented formation control scheme.

AB The development and application of autonomous vehicles bring great changes to urban traffic management and control. As one of the bottlenecks to improve transportation efficiency, intersection management plays an important role in the urban city. When the dynamic control method in different cases is determined, the key of autonomous intersection management problem is to search the passing orders for approaching connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). The paper proposed a framework based on convolutional neural network to predict different passing orders' total time consumption. Thus, the best passing order with the lowest time consume can be chosen as the optimal solution. Then continuous-time optimal control can be carried out on CAVs. Meanwhile, sequential model-based algorithm configuration technique is used for neural network training. Simulation results exported from Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) indicate that the proposed method outperforms actuated signal control and first come first serve strategy. The average delay of the proposed method can decrease by 42.40%-73.05% compared with actuated signal control and 2.95%-55.29% compared to first come first serve strategy. Moreover, it can increase average speed by more than 20% compared with the other two methods. The proposed method can significantly reduce the computation time comparing with the original planning-based strategy. At last, the framework can be applied to other regression tasks like vehicle emissions, then different optimization targets can be estimated to get better solutions faster.

ID VEHICLE; CARS; SAFETY
AB Lane changing is a critical task for autonomous driving, especially in heavy traffic. Numerous automatic lane-changing algorithms have been proposed. However, surrounding vehicles are usually treated as moving obstacles without considering the interaction between vehicles/drivers. This paper presents a game theory-based lane-changing model, which mimics human behavior by interacting with surrounding drivers using the turn signal and lateral moves. The aggressiveness of the surrounding vehicles/drivers is estimated based on their reactions. With this model, the controller is capable of extracting information and learning from the interaction in real time. As such, the optimal timing and acceleration for changing lanes with respect to a variety of aggressiveness in target lane vehicle behavior are found accordingly. The game theory based controller was tested in Simulink and dSPACE. Scenarios were designed so that a vehicle controlled by a game theory-based controller could interact with vehicles controlled by both robot and human drivers. Test results show that the game theory-based controller is capable of changing lanes in a human-like manner and outperforms fixed rule-based controllers.

Furthermore, a network of 322 hydrogen stations would be necessary for refueling the maximum number of fuel cell vehicles, given the actual limitations of the electrical grid for hydrogen generation. Thus, considering that hydrogen used for refueling would be generated by electrolysis using the electrical grid, fuel cell vehicles would only be a 4% less polluting than an internal combustion vehicle. However, if we could achieve a substitution ratio of 25% of the total (CV by FCV, the Autonomous Region of Murcia could avoid the emission of up to 24,500 metric Tons of CO2 to the atmosphere every year. This value contrasts with the 2.2 millions of metric tons of CO2 that could be avoided using electric vehicles. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we present the design, development and a practical use of an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) as a modular and flexible platform for a large variety of marine tasks including the coordination strategies with other marine robots. This work tackles the integration of an open-source Robot-Operating-System (ROS)-based control architecture that provides the ASV with a wide variety of navigation behaviors. These new ASV capabilities can be used to acquire useful data from the environment to survey, map, and characterize marine habitats. In addition, the ASV is used as a radio frequency relay point between an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) and the ground station as well as to enhance the Acoustic Communication Link (ACL) with the AUV. In order to improve the quality of the ACL, a new Marine Multirobot System (MMRS) coordination strategy has been developed that aims to keep both vehicles close to each other. The entire system has been successfully designed, implemented, and tested in real marine environment robotic tasks. The experimental tests show satisfactory results both in ROS-based navigation architecture and the MMRS coordination strategy resulting in a significant improvement of the quality of the ACL.

AB In this paper, the trajectory tracking control of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUVs) in six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOFs) is addressed. It is assumed that the system parameters are unknown and the vehicle is underactuated. An adaptive controller is proposed, based on Lyapunov's direct method and the back-stepping technique, which interestingly guarantees robustness against parameter uncertainties. The desired trajectory can be any sufficiently smooth bounded curve parameterized by time even if consist of straight line. In contrast with the majority of research in this field, the likelihood of actuators' saturation is considered and another adaptive controller is designed to overcome this problem, in which control signals are bounded using saturation functions. The nonlinear adaptive control scheme yields asymptotic convergence of the vehicle to the reference trajectory, in the presence of parametric uncertainties. The stability of the presented control laws is proved in the sense of Lyapunov theory and Barbalat's lemma. Efficiency of presented controller using saturation functions is verified through comparing numerical simulations of both controllers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We coordinate in discrete time the interaction of two heterogeneous groups of mobile agents: a group of ground vehicles (UGvs) and a group of aerial vehicles (UAVs). The ground agents interact with each other through time-invariant, nearest-neighbour rules. They synchronize their velocities through a specific Communication protocol, and maintain cohesion and separation behaviour by means of interagent potential forces. Ground vehicles estimate their formation's centroid using only locally available delayed information. That same information is transmitted to the aerial group, which orbits above the ground formation's centroid, while avoiding midair collisions. Stability of the ground group motion is established in a Lyapunov framework. A Lyapunov analysis is also used to ensure that UAVS track the ground group's centroid. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB Several works have been carried out in the realm of RGB-D SLAM development, yet they have neither been thoroughly assessed nor adapted for outdoor vehicular contexts. This paper proposes an extension of HOOFR SLAM to an enhanced IR-D modality applied to an autonomous vehicle in an outdoor environment. We address the most prevalent camera issues in outdoor contexts: environments with an image-dominant overcast sky and the presence of dynamic objects. We used a depth-based filtering method to identify outlier points based on their depth value. The method is robust against outliers and also computationally inexpensive. For faster processing, we suggest optimization of the pose estimation block by replacing the RANSAC method used for essential matrix estimation with PROSAC. We assessed the algorithm using a self-collected IR-D dataset gathered by the SATIE laboratory instrumented vehicle using a PC and an embedded architecture. We compared the measurement results to those of the most advanced algorithms by assessing translational error and average processing time. The results revealed a significant reduction in localization errors and a significant gain in processing speed compared to the state-of-the-art stereo (HOOFR SLAM) and RGB-D algorithms (Orb-slam2, Rtab-map).

ID PROBABILITY; JUDGMENT; BENEATH
AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are effective platforms for science research and monitoring, and for military and commercial data-gathering purposes. However, there is an inevitable risk of loss during any mission. Quantifying the risk of loss is complex, due to the combination of vehicle reliability and environmental factors, and cannot be determined through analytical means alone. An alternative approach - formal expert judgment - is a time-consuming process; consequently a method is needed to broaden the applicability of judgments beyond the narrow confines of an elicitation for a defined environment. We propose and explore a solution founded on a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN), where the results of the expert judgment elicitation are taken as the initial prior probability of loss due to failure. The network topology captures the causal effects of the environment separately on the vehicle and on the support platform, and combines these to produce an updated probability of loss due to failure. An extended version of the Kaplan-Meier estimator is then used to update the mission risk profile with travelled distance. Sensitivity analysis of the BBN is presented and a case study of Autosub3 AUV deployment in the Amundsen Sea is discussed in detail. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a deterministic acceleration model is developed considering the sensor detection range to capture the underlying process of car following dynamic of au-tonomous vehicles. A delayed-feedback control is proposed using the difference between current state of throttle angle and previous one as feedback term and incorporated into the developed deterministic acceleration model to suppress the traffic congestion and increase the stability of traffic flow without the aid of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2I) communication. The feasible ranges of control parameters that ensure smooth traffic flow is derived from the perspective of the frequency domain via Hurvitz criteria and H & INFIN; norm of transfer functions. The impact of proposed control strategy on the stability of macroscopic traffic flow is studied. The numerical-based simulations reveal that using the delayed-feedback of throttle angle with proper designed gains and delay time improves traffic efficiency, maintains scalable for large systems of autonomous vehicles, suppress the traffic congestion effectively, and dissipate shockwaves.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB Constrained operations for autonomous vehicles have been extensively studied in the literature over the recent years. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, all of the existing works address only constant or time-varying constraint functions. In this work, we study path-dependent constraint requirements, which explicitly depend on the path parameter, instead of depending on the time variable directly. This approach is more practical in reality, where the constraint requirements are often shaped by the environment boundaries. From the system users' perspectives, it is also much easier to define constraint functions based on the path parameter. A modified version of the universal barrier function is used in the analysis of path-dependent constraint requirements. We show that under the proposed novel control scheme, the vehicle's line-of-sight distance and angle error terms can converge into small sets near the equilibrium with a fixed-time convergence rate, while the path-dependent constraint requirements are satisfied at all time. A simulation and an experiment study further demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme.

With the continuous updating of core technologies such as artificial intelligence, sensor detection, synchronous positioning, and high-precision mapping, the development of AV has been promoted. When 5G network is combined with Internet of Vehicles, the problems of AV can be solved by taking advantage of 5G ultra-large bandwidth, low latency and high reliability. However, when the user controls the vehicle remotely, a real-time and reliable authentication process is needed, while minimizing the overhead of security protocols. Therefore, this article proposes a practical and secure multifactor user authentication protocol for AV in 5G network. By introducing non-interactive zero-knowledge proof technology and physical uncloning function, the protocol completes mutual authentication and key agreement without revealing any sensitive information. The article proves the security of the protocol through BAN logic and the simulation of Scyther. And it can resist malicious attacks and provide more security features. The informal security analysis shows that the protocol can meet the proposed security requirements. Finally, we evaluate the efficiency of the protocol, and the results show that the protocol can provide better performance.

AB This paper focuses on adaptive integral sliding mode control for a class of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with uncertain dynamics, where the vehicles moving in three-dimensional (3-D) space have only three available control inputs provided by the stem propellers, steering and diving rudders but five degrees of freedom to be controlled. Different from the traditional sliding mode control, the proposed dual closed-loop integral sliding mode control design can be described as comprising two distinct phases: 1) in outer-loop, the virtual velocity commands are determined for the following work; 2) in inner-loop, the actual control inputs are designed to achieve the trajectory tracking. Moreover, the practical situations that there exist systematic parametric uncertainties and external disturbances are also considered, and a novel direct adaptive neural network controller combined with a conditional integrator is presented, which provides the robustness and adaptation for the vehicle. In addition, the rigorous stability analysis based Lyapunov's method demonstrates the uniform ultimate boundedness of all the tracking errors in the closed-loop system. Finally, simulation results are shown the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.

ID RETRIEVAL-SYSTEMS; STORAGE; NETWORKS; MODELS
AB Distribution centers have recently adopted Autonomous Vehicle-based Storage and Retrieval Systems (AVS/RSs) as a potential alternative to traditional automated storage and retrieval systems for processing unit-load operations. The autonomy of the vehicles in an AVS/RS provides a level of hardware sophistication, which can lead to the improvements in operation efficiency and flexibility that will be necessary in distribution centers of the future. However, in order to exploit the potential benefits of the technology, an AVS/RS must be designed using a detailed understanding of the underlying dynamics and performance trade-offs. Design decisions such as the configuration of aisles and columns, allocation of resources to zones, and vehicle assignment rules can have a significant impact on the performance of AVS/RSs. In this research, the performance impact of these design decisions is investigated using an analytical model. The system is modeled as a multi-class semi-open queuing network with class switching and a decomposition-based approach is developed to evaluate the system performance and obtain insights. Numerical studies provide various insights that could be useful in the design conceptualization of AVS/RSs.

TI Positioning an autonomous off-road vehicle by using fused DGPS and
   inertial navigation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper deals with a positioning system for an autonomous vehicle ARSKA. Localization of the vehicle is based on fusion of internal dead reckoning navigation and periodic absolute position measurements. Fusion is performed by using a Kalman-type filtering technique. A similar kind of approach is used in correcting the heading measurement. This is important because the position error is mostly the result of the accumulated heading error. The resulting accuracy depends on the accuracy of the dead reckoning estimation and on the accuracy and frequency of the absolute position measurement. As an absolute position measurement system, several alternatives can be used. Two different systems have been used with the vehicle: an external optical measurement device, tachymeter, and different combinations of DGPS. A real guarding application will be discussed in the paper.

AB To solve the problem of trajectory tracking lateral control in autonomous driving technology, a model predictive control (MPC) controller trajectory tracking lateral control method combined with a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DDPG) is proposed in this paper. This method inputs the real-time state of the vehicle into DDPG to achieve real-time automatic optimization of the prediction time domain and control time domain parameters of the MPC controller, and then affects the specific performance of the MPC controller in trajectory tracking lateral control. Specifically, the state space, action space, and reward function of DDPG are defined, and the automatic driving trajectory tracking lateral controller is designed in combination with the vehicle dynamics model. To reduce the exploration space of DDPG and improve the training efficiency of the entire model, the technique of advantage-disadvantage experience separation and extraction is introduced. Finally, the proposed method was trained and verified in various scenarios, and compared with two other lateral control methods for autonomous driving. The results showed that the learning and training time of the trajectory tracking lateral control method based on DDPG-MPC was shorter than that of the DDPG-based method, and the evaluation indicators in the trajectory tracking control process were better than those of the DDPG-based method and original MPC-based method.

AB The accurate trajectory prediction is a crucial task for the autonomous vehicles that help to plan and fast decision making capability of the system to reach their destination in the complex road scenario with abiding by the traffic rules. For this, autonomous vehicles should have more attention to their goal without affecting the other's task and maintain their safety from road accidents. With this motivation, we proposed a multi-scale graph-transformer-based attention mechanism that provides the interaction between the road agents with different time instances, because from time to time, few new agents may enter the frame scene, and few may leave the frame scene. Each dynamic obstacles trajectory can be defined as state sequences within an interval of time, where spatial coordinates of dynamic obstacles represented by the each state under the world coordinate frame. We have presented graph-based Multi-scale spatial features with transformer network that achieves significant prediction results compared to other existing methods, and we provide an in-depth analysis of the trained weights for different highways scenarios with transformer and the Long-Short Term Memory. We evaluate our model with three publicly available datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performances as presented in the manuscript. The performance balance is more in favour of our model for sparser datasets compared to the dense datasets.

AB Autonomous navigation in forest terrain, where operation paths are rarely straight or flat and obstacles are common, is challenging. This paper evaluates a system designed to autonomously follow previously demonstrated paths in a forest environment without loading/unloading timber, a pre-step in the development of fully autonomous forwarders. The system consisted of a forwarder equipped with a high-precision global positioning system to measure the vehicle's heading and position. A gyro was used to compensate for the influence of the vehicle's roll and pitch. On an ordinary clear-cut forest area with numerous stumps, the vehicle was able to follow two different tracks, three times each at a speed of 1 m s-1, with a mean path tracking error of 6 and 7 cm, respectively. The error never exceeded 35 cm, and in 90% of the observations it was less than 14 and 15 cm, respectively. This accuracy is well within the necessary tolerance for forestry operations. In fact, a human operator would probably have a hard time following the track more accurately. Hence, the developed systems function satisfactorily when using previously demonstrated paths. However, further research on planning new paths in unknown unstructured terrain and on loading/unloading is required before timber transports can be fully automated.

AB In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed for the visual target tracking by Autonomous Guide Vehicles (AGV). This paper proposes a sensor data fusion system to estimate the dynamics of the target. Optical flow vectors, colour features, stereo pair disparities are used as the Visual features while the vehicle's inertial measurements are used to estimate the stereo cameras' motion. The algorithm estimates the velocity and position of the target which is then used by the vehicle to track the target. In this sensor data fusion-based tracking system, the measurements from the same target can arrive out of sequence. This is called the "Out-Of-Sequence" Measurements (OOSM) problem. Thus the resulting problem - how to update the current state estimate with an "older" measurement - needs to be solved. In this paper the 1-step-lag OOSM solution from Bar-Shalom is applied for the Extended Kalman Filter-based target-state estimation. The performance of the proposed tracking algorithm with the OOSM solution is demonstrated through extensive experimental results. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To operate an autonomous driving vehicle on real roads, a multi-sensor-based object detection and classification module should carry out simultaneously processing in the autonomous system for safe driving. Additionally, the object detection results must have high-speed processing performance in a limited HW platform for autonomous vehicles. To solve this problem, we used the Redmon in DARKNET-based () deep learning method to modify a detector that obtains the local position estimation in real time. The aim of this study was to get the local position information of a moving object by fusing the information from multi-cameras and one RADAR. Thus, we made a fusion server to synchronize and converse the information of multi-objects from multi-sensors on our autonomous vehicle. In this paper, we introduce a method to solve the local position estimation that recognizes the around view which includes the long-, middle- and short-range view. We also describe a method to solve the problem caused by a steep slope and a curving road condition while driving. Additionally, we introduce the results of our proposed MOD-based detection and tracking estimation to achieve a license for autonomous driving in KOREA.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL
AB A Learning-based Model Predictive Control (LMPC) algorithm is proposed for a Formula Student (FS) autonomous vehicle. The online learning algorithm has two distinct roles: to improve the dynamic model accuracy of the vehicle used in the MPC, while performing online tuning of the model predictive controller parameters. The developed controller is shown to reduce the total lap time through an iterative learning process as the vehicle progresses on track. To capture the full complexity of the nonlinear higher order dynamics, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) complements the vehicle's nominal model. The ANN is trained using an online supervised learning scheme based on past model prediction errors. Additionally, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to iteratively find the optimal set of controller parameters that maximizes a reward function. Several simulation tests performed on real examples of competition tracks demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. Moreover, it is shown that the combination of both online learning methods is able to significantly improve tracking performance of the FS vehicle, eventually reducing the total lap time by over 16%.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB There has been a growing interest in nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) for the motion control of autonomous driving. However, it is odd that integration stability has not been considered enough when developing these applications for autonomous driving, which results in inefficient performance of NMPC-based motion controllers. The stabilized explicit Runge-Kutta (RK) integration method is adopted in this paper to solve the integration stability problem in motion control of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In comparison with other explicit integration methods, this method provides a wider stable region and is more efficient than implicit integration methods. This integration method is integrated into the framework of offset free nonlinear model predictive control (OF-NMPC) solver based on gradient-based MPC (GRAMPC) by us. As a result, the problem of computational stability at low speeds of motion control can be resolved. And, a larger integration step size can be adopted, NMPC becomes more computationally efficient. The results of simulation and real vehicle experiment show that the problem of low-speed integration stability when using nonlinear dynamic model as a prediction model is successfully solved. At the same time, since the offset free NMPC is adopted, the longitudinal and lateral steady-state errors are eliminated.

AB Public acceptance of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is vital for a society to reap their intended benefits such as reduced traffic accidents, land usage, congestion and environmental pollution. The purpose of this paper is to use the theory of planned behaviour to pinpoint and examine the components affecting public acceptance of AVs. A model consisting of a network of hypothesised relationships is introduced. Thereafter, 526 residents in Seoul, Korea, were given a survey created for this research. Subsequently, to evaluate the collected information and estimate the model, structural equation modelling was adopted. The outcomes show individuals' mindset on AVs, subjective customs, and behavioural influence directly influencing the acceptance of AVs. Furthermore, cognitive and emotive factors, namely comparative advantage, compatibility, complexity and hedonic motivation indirectly influence the acceptance of AVs via mindset and behavioural manipulation. Based on analysing the cumulative effect, attitude emerged with the strongest effect on public acceptance of autonomous vehicles. After this is, in decreasing order of influence, behavioural control, relative advantage, subjective norms, compatibility, hedonic motivation and complexity. The findings of this study implicate the prioritisation and allocation of resources, and policies relating to marketing, education, subsidisation and infrastructure development to better public acceptance of AVs.

AB The proliferation of technologies embedded in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) increases the potential of cyber-attacks. The communication systems between vehicles and infrastructure present remote attack access for malicious hackers to exploit system vulnerabilities. Increased connectivity combined with autonomous driving functions pose a considerable threat to the vast socioeconomic benefits promised by CAVs. However, the absence of historical information on cyber-attacks mean that traditional risk assessment methods are rendered ineffective. This paper proposes a proactive CAV cyber-risk classification model which overcomes this issue by incorporating known software vulnerabilities contained within the US National Vulnerability Database into model building and testing phases. This method uses a Bayesian Network (BN) model, premised on the variables and causal relationships derived from the Common Vulnerability Scoring Scheme (CVSS), to represent the probabilistic structure and parameterisation of CAV cyber-risk. The resulting BN model is validated with an out-of-sample test demonstrating nearly 100% prediction accuracy of the quantitative risk score and qualitative risk level. The model is then applied to the use-case of GPS systems of a CAV with and without cryptographic authentication. In the use case, we demonstrate how the model can be used to predict the effect of risk reduction measures.

AB Robustness to interference and low energy consumption are two important issues hindering development of laser-sensing technology for autonomous driving. In this paper, we propose and present an all-in-one sensing solution based on single-photon-detector (SPD) for autonomous driving to address those issues. Incorporating one laser source and several SPDs, the proposed solution is capable of collision avoidance LIDAR and lane marker detection simultaneously. The proposed solution is introduced theoretically, and the effectiveness is further validated by proof-of-concept indoor experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed SPD-based sensing solution can robustly detect targets on the road 16.1% faster than the previous proposition, and it can also achieve error free recognition of lane marker at the speed range of 0-96 km/h.

AB Autonomous systems promise significant improvements in many fields. These systems will be subject to legal governance requirements. The literature has largely focused on "autonomous governance " as a framework that is broadly applicable to autonomous devices regardless of the type of system (e.g., aviation or motor vehicles) at issue. While there are regulatory principles applicable to autonomous systems generally, an "autonomy-focused " approach is an inadequate lens to consider the governance of these systems. Rather, because autonomous systems are improvements of currently regulated complex systems, the regulation of autonomous elements will occur within those systems' preexisting regulatory framework. Accordingly, the nature of future autonomous regulation will likely depend on the preexisting features of that substantive system, rather than on an optimal approach divorced from that history, an attribute known in the social science literature as path dependency. In order to characterize diverse regulated systems with an eye toward assessing future autonomous developments, we develop a framework of regulatory approaches to identify specific features of the preexisting regulatory scheme for a given system. We then analyze that approach by examining three different regulatory regimes (aviation, motor vehicles, and medical devices), across two different continents, and consider how the same type of requirement, e.g., fail-safe systems, can lead to different types of regulations depending on the differing baseline framework.

AB We study the operational problem of shared autonomous electric vehicles that cooperate in providing on-demand mobility services while maximizing fleet profit and service quality. Therefore, we model the fleet operator and vehicles as interactive agents enriched with advanced decision-making aids. Our focus is on learning smart charging policies (when and where to charge vehicles) in anticipation of uncertain future demands to accommodate long charging times, restricted charging infrastructure, and time-varying electricity prices. We propose a distributed approach and formulate the problem as a semiMarkov decision process to capture its stochastic and dynamic nature. We use cooperative multiagent reinforcement learning with reshaped reward functions. The effectiveness and scalability of the proposed model are upgraded through deep learning. A mean-field approximation deals with environment instabilities, and hierarchical learning distinguishes high-level and low-level decisions. We evaluate our model using various numerical examples based on real data from ShareNow in Berlin, Germany. We show that the policies learned using our decentralized and dynamic approach outperform central static charging strategies. Finally, we conduct a sensitivity analysis for different fleet characteristics to demonstrate the proposed model's robustness and provide managerial insights into the impacts of strategic decisions on fleet performance and derived charging policies.

AB The electrification of vehicle helps to improve its operation efficiency and safety. Due to fast development of network, sensors, as well as computing technology, it becomes realizable to have vehicles driving autonomously. To achieve autonomous driving, several steps, including environment perception, path-planning, and dynamic control, need to be done. However, vehicles equipped with on-board sensors still have limitations in acquiring necessary environmental data for optimal driving decisions. Intelligent and connected vehicles (ICV) cloud control system (CCS) has been introduced as a new concept as it is a potentially synthetic solution for high level automated driving to improve safety and optimize traffic flow in intelligent transportation. This paper systematically investigated the concept of cloud control system from cloud related applications on ICVs, and cloud control system architecture design, as well as its core technologies development. Based on the analysis, the challenges and suggestions on cloud control system development have been addressed.

AB The simulation tools geared towards promoting sustainability in Mobility as a Service (MaaS) evaluation is inherently a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) challenge due to three primary concerns: the criteria significance, data variability, and the expert opinions' uncertainty. Despite efforts in recent years, no current developed MaaS has fully addressed all evaluation criteria. Moreover, no research has evaluated the sustainability of MaaS in the context of determining its optimality. As such, this research's pivotal contribution is to present an evaluation of simulation tools for sustainable MaaS in autonomous vehicles operating in smart cities. This evaluation leans on the advanced extension of a newly proposed an interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy rough set (IVFFRS) incorporated within integrated MCDM methodologies. The IVFFRS is designed to capture intricate and uncertain evaluative data. The initial phase of the evaluation methodology involves formulating the evaluation criteria using an interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy rough set, fuzzily weighted for zero inconsistency. The subsequent phase adopts the interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy rough decision via the opinion score method to prioritize alternatives in light of data variations. This study evaluates ten distinct simulation tools for MaaS in autonomous vehicles based on seven criteria. The methodology's robustness is further ascertained through sensitivity and comparative analyses.

AB The concept of the autonomous vehicle (AV) is becoming a credible alternative for the coming decades. Interest in AVs has been mirrored by a strong increase in the number of academic papers on the subject. However, few studies have considered a genuinely autonomous vehicle or similar in a realistic environment. They are limited to autonomous shuttles and restricted roads to test attitudes to and acceptance of AVs. This paper reports an exploratory experiment carried out on AV use in real conditions. The objective is to analyze the evolution of AV representation by participants (n = 30) before and after the experiment, between dreams about AVs and reality. The feelings and attitudes induced by AVs and the activities that could be performed in them are considered. The findings show that many of the participants were initially in favor of AVs and were very excited about the idea of the test. Most of them did not feel any stress and the level of trust was high. After the experiment, feelings such as stress and fear increased and the level of trust decreased. Finally, the two main activities declared by the participants before the experiment were similar to the declaration after, being, respectively "watching the road" and "watching through windows."

AB COVID-19 is one of the most important dilemmas that took place during the last few years. Logisticians worked hard to present a new mechanism called Autonomous Delivery Vehicles (ADVs) by which they afford help making life easier for people during pandemic while trying to reduce pollution on road as well. This work mainly aimed to explore Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) and the convenience of users - according to gender - to the idea of using Autonomous Delivery Vehicles (ADVs). A survey-based method was applied and presented. It was distributed online where a total of 450 participants had taken part to express their ideas. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the data and the results were discussed thor-oughly. The model was conducted according to nine hypotheses. Results showed that all of them were supported except hypothesis 7, which is the trust in technology that negatively influenced the perceived risk leading to rejecting the hypothesis that supposes the validity of H7. It was concluded that the perceived risk and behavioral intention relationship were only significant for males while the perceived risk and trust in technology rela-tionship were only significant for females.

AB Steering angle prediction is critical in the control of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and has attracted the attention of researchers, manufacturers, and insurance companies in the automotive industry. Different Deep Learning (DL) architectures have been applied to predict the steering angle of AVs in various scenarios. A survey on steering angle prediction based on deep learning algorithms can help expert researchers identify those areas that require development. Also, novice researchers can use the survey as a starting point. In this article, we present a broad study on the recent advances made in DL architectures that covers the steering angle prediction of AVs. A new comprehensive taxonomy of the application of DL in steering angle prediction of AVs is created. The survey presents a concise research summary synthesis, and analysis. It is found that most researchers depend on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) over other DL architectures in predicting the steering angle of autonomous driving vehicles. Also identified are open research problems. The prominent challenge facing DL-based steering angle prediction of AVs is lack of sufficient real-world datasets, which means that researchers largely depend on data generated from simulated environments. Lastly, alternative viewpoints to solve the identified open research challenges are proposed, pointing towards promising future research directions.

AB Micro Aerial Vehicles (FOV) are very suitable for flying in indoor environments, but autonomous navigation is challenging due to their strict hardware limitations. This paper presents a highly efficient computer vision algorithm called Edge-FS for the determination of velocity and depth. It runs at 20 Hz on a 4 g stereo camera with an embedded STM32F4 microprocessor (168 MHz, 192 kB) and uses edge distributions to calculate optical flow and stereo disparity. The stereo-based distance estimates are used to scale the optical flow in order to retrieve the drone's velocity. The velocity and depth measurements are used for fully autonomous flight of a 40 g pocket drone only relying on on-board sensors. This method allows the MAV to control its velocity and avoid obstacles.

AB In multivehicle autonomous systems that operate under unknown or adversarial environments, it is a challenging task to simultaneously achieve source seeking and obstacle avoidance. Indeed, even for single-vehicle systems, smooth time-invariant feedback controllers based on navigation or barrier functions have been shown to be highly susceptible to arbitrarily small jamming signals that can induce instability in the closed-loop system, or that are able to stabilize spurious equilibria in the operational space. When the location of the source is further unknown, adaptive smooth source seeking dynamics based on averaging theory may suffer from similar limitations. In this article, we address this problem by introducing a class of novel distributed hybrid model-free controllers, that achieve robust source seeking and obstacle avoidance in multivehicle autonomous systems, with vehicles characterized by nonlinear continuous-time dynamics stabilizable by hybrid feedback. The hybrid source seeking law switches between a family of cooperative gradient-free controllers, derived from potential fields that satisfy mild invexity assumptions. The stability and robustness properties of the closed-loop system are analyzed using Lyapunov tools and singular perturbation theory for set-valued hybrid dynamical systems. The theoretical results are validated via numerical and experimental tests.

AB The development of algorithms for agile science and autonomous exploration has been pursued in contexts ranging from spacecraft to planetary rovers to unmanned aerial vehicles to autonomous underwater vehicles. In situations where time, mission resources and communications are limited and the future state of the operating environment is unknown, the capability of a vehicle to dynamically respond to changing circumstances without human guidance can substantially improve science return. Such capabilities are difficult to achieve in practice, however, because they require intelligent reasoning to utilize limited resources in an inherently uncertain environment. Here we discuss the development, characterization and field performance of two algorithms for autonomously collecting water samples on VALKYRIE (Very deep Autonomous Laser-powered Kilowatt-class Yo-yoing Robotic Ice Explorer), a glacier-penetrating cryobot deployed to the Matanuska Glacier, Alaska (Mission Control location: 61 degrees 42'09.3"N 147 degrees 37'23.2"W). We show performance on par with human performance across a wide range of mission morphologies using simulated mission data, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms at autonomously collecting samples with high relative cell concentration during field operation. The development of such algorithms will help enable autonomous science operations in environments where constant real-time human supervision is impractical, such as penetration of ice sheets on Earth and high-priority planetary science targets like Europa.

AB Safe and adaptable motion planning for autonomous vehicles remains an open problem in urban environments, where the variability of situations and behaviors may become intractable using rule-based approaches. This work proposes a use-case-independent motion planning algorithm that generates a set of possible trajectories and selects the best of them according to a merit function that combines longitudinal comfort, lateral comfort, safety and utility criteria. The system was tested in urban scenarios on simulated and real environments, and the results show that different driving styles can be achieved according to the priorities set in the merit function, always meeting safety and comfort parameters imposed by design.

AB This paper presents a computationally efficient approach that can be applied to visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for the autonomous inspection of underwater structures using monocular vision. A selective image registration scheme consisting of key-frame selection and key-pair selection is proposed to effectively use visual features that may not be evenly distributed on the surface of underwater structures. The computational cost of the visual SLAM algorithm can be substantially reduced using only potentially effective images and image pairs by applying the proposed image registration scheme. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated on two different experimental datasets obtained using autonomous underwater vehicles.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; OPTIMIZATION; NAVIGATION
AB Kinodynamic motion planning is critical for autonomous vehicles with high maneuverability in dynamic environments. However, obtaining near-optimal motion planning solutions with low computational costs and inaccurate prior model information is challenging. To address this issue, this paper proposes a receding-horizon reinforcement learning approach for kinodynamic motion planning (RHRL-K DP) of autonomous vehicles in the presence of inaccurate dynamics information and moving obstacles. Specifically, a receding-horizon actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm is presented, resulting in a neural network-based planning strategy that can be learned both offline and online. A neural network-based model is built and learned online to approximate the modeling uncertainty of the prior nominal model in order to improve planning performance. Furthermore, active collision avoidance in dynamic environments is realized by constructing safety-related terms in actor and critic networks using potential fields. In theory, the uniformly ultimate boundedness property of the modeling uncertainty's approximation error is proven, and the convergence of the proposed RHRL-KDP is analyzed. Simulation tests show that our approach outperforms the previously developed motion planners based on model predictive control (MPC), safe RL, and RRT* in terms of planning performance. Furthermore, in both online and offline learning scenarios, RHRL-KDP outperforms MPC and RRT* in terms of computational efficiency.

ID RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT
AB For autonomous vehicles (AV), the ability to share information about their surroundings is crucial. With Level 4 and 5 autonomy in sight, solving the challenge of organization and efficient storing of data, coming from these connected platforms, becomes paramount. Research done up to now has been mostly focused on communication and network layers of V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) data sharing. However, there is a gap when it comes to the data layer. Limited attention has been paid to the ontology development in the automotive domain. More specifically, the way to integrate sensor data and geospatial data efficiently is missing. Therefore, we proposed to develop a new Connected Traffic Data Ontology (CTDO) on the foundations of Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator (SOSA) ontology, to provide a more suitable ontology for large volumes of time-sensitive data coming from multi-sensory platforms, like connected vehicles, as the first step in closing the existing research gap. Additionally, as this research aims to further extend the CTDO in the future, a possible way to map to the CTDO with ontologies that represent road infrastructure has been presented. Finally, new CTDO ontology was benchmarked against SOSA, and better memory performance and query execution speeds have been confirmed.

AB Autonomous parking techniques can be used to tackle the lacking problem of parking spaces. In this paper, a sampling-based motion planner consisting of optimizing bidirectional rapidly-exploring random trees* (Bi-RRT*) and parking-oriented model predictive control (MPC) is proposed to properly deal with various parking scenarios. The optimal Bi-RRT* approach aims to improve the common defects of traditional sampling-based motion planners, such as uncertainties of path quality and consistency, and exploring inefficiency in narrow spaces. For this reason, the proposed motion planner is able to overcome strict environments with obstacles and narrow spaces. The parking-oriented MPC is then designed for steering and speed controls simultaneously for accurately and smoothly tracking parking paths. Furthermore, the proposed controller is dedicated to work under the practical scenarios, such as vehicle considerations, real-time control, and signal delay. To verify the effects of the proposed autonomous parking system, extensive simulations and experiments are conducted in common and strict parking scenarios, such as perpendicular parking, parallel parking. The simulation results not only verify the effects of each technical element, but also show the capability to deal with the various parking scenarios. Furthermore, various on-car experiments sufficiently demonstrate that the proposed system can be actually implemented in everyday life.

AB In this article, a deep reinforcement learning-based path-following control scheme is established for an under-actuated autonomous marine vehicle (AMV) in the presence of model uncertainties and unknown marine environment disturbances is presented. By virtue of light-of-sight guidance, a surge-heading joint guidance method is developed within the kinematic level, thereby enabling the AMV to follow the desired path accurately. Within the dynamic level, model uncertainties and time-varying environment disturbances are taken into account, and the reinforcement learning control method using the twin-delay deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) is developed for the under-actuated vehicle, where path-following actions are generated via the state space and hybrid rewards. Additionally, actor-critic networks are developed using the long-short time memory (LSTM) network, and the vehicle can successfully make a decision by the aid of historical states, thus enhancing the convergence rate of dynamic controllers. Simulation results and comprehensive comparisons on a prototype AMV demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness and superiority of the proposed LSTM-TD3-based path-following control scheme.

AB This article addresses the cooperative multitarget encircling control of underactuated autonomous surface vehicles with unknown kinetics subject to velocity and input constraints. A distributed observer is designed for the vehicles to estimate the geometric center of the area covered by multiple moving targets. Based on the target center estimate, a multitarget encircling guidance law is developed to form encircling trajectories around the targets. A data-driven fuzzy predictor is designed for learning the vehicle kinetics, including model input gains, with available data. Based on the learned model, a nominal control law is developed to track reference guidance signals. In order to satisfy the velocity and input constraints, a feasibility condition for velocities is derived based on a control barrier function, and a neurodynamics-based optimal control law is developed based on the feasibility condition and input constraint. The bounded input-to-state stability of the closed-loop control system is theoretically proved. Simulation results are elaborated to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach for circumnavigating multiple moving targets.

AB Background The imminent emergence of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) highlights the need for preparing the road infrastructure for traffic flows mixed with CAVs and human-driven vehicles. A dedicated lane (DL) for CAVs is one of the practical and potential ways to upgrade the road infrastructure for the mixed traffic. Methods This paper proposes a theoretical method to discuss the influence of implementing a CAV DL policy on the freeway traffic efficiency. In detail, the impact was measured by capacity and throughput. The calculation methods of these efficiency measurements under different CAV DL policies were proposed. Experiments Numerical experiments were conducted under various compositions of CAV DL policies and traffic conditions. More specifically, the relationship between the traffic conditions (i.e., traffic demand, market penetration rate (MPR) of CAVs, platoon intensity of CAVs, willingness of CAVs using the CAV DL) and the CAV DL policies (i.e., lane configuration, DL access control policy) were discussed. Results and Conclusion The results have led to some interesting findings, including the critical values of MPR that are valuable to guide an appropriate implementation of a CAV DL policy under a specific traffic condition.

AB IntroductionThis study delves into the ethical dimensions surrounding autonomous vehicles (AVs), with a specific focus on decision-making algorithms. Termed the "Trolley problem," an ethical quandary arises, necessitating the formulation of moral algorithms grounded in ethical principles. To address this issue, an online survey was conducted with 460 participants in China, comprising 237 females and 223 males, spanning ages 18 to 70.MethodsAdapted from Joshua Greene's trolley dilemma survey, our study employed Yes/No options to probe participants' choices and Likert scales to gauge moral acceptance. The primary objective was to assess participants' inclinations toward four distinct algorithmic strategies-Utilitarianism, Rawlsianism, Egoism, and a Hybrid approach-in scenarios involving AVsResultsOur findings revealed a significant disparity between participants' preferences in scenarios related to AV design and those focused on purchase decisions. Notably, over half of the respondents expressed reluctance to purchase AVs equipped with an "egoism" algorithm, which prioritizes the car owner's safety. Intriguingly, the rejection rate for "egoism" was similar to that of "utilitarianism," which may necessitate self-sacrifice.DiscussionThe hybrid approach, integrating "Utilitarianism" and "Egoism," garnered the highest endorsement. This highlights the importance of balancing self-sacrifice and harm minimization in AV moral algorithms. The study's insights are crucial for ethically and practically advancing AV technology in the continually evolving realm of autonomous vehicles.

AB The realization of a novel human gesture recognition algorithm is essential to enable the effective collision avoidance of autonomous vehicles. Compared to visible spectrum cameras, the use of infrared imaging can enable more robust human gesture recognition in a complex environment. However, gesture recognition in infrared images has not been extensively investigated. In this work, we propose a model to detect human gestures, based on the improved YOLO-V3 network involving a saliency map as the second input channel to enhance the reuse of features and improve the network performance. Three DenseNet blocks are added before the residual components in the YOLO-V3 network to enhance the convolutional feature propagation. The saliency maps are obtained by multiscale superpixel segmentation, superpixel block clustering and cellular automata saliency detection. The obtained five scale saliency maps are fused using a Bayesian based fusion algorithm, and the final saliency image is generated. The infrared images composed of 4 main gesture classes are collected, each of which contains several approximated gestures in morphological terms. The training and testing datasets are generated, including original and augmented infrared images with a resolution of 640 x 480. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can enable real time human gesture detection for autonomous vehicles, with an average detection accuracy of 86.2%.

AB Disaster robotics has become a research area in its own right, with several reported cases of successful robot deployment in actual disaster scenarios. Most of these disaster deployments use aerial, ground, or underwater robotic platforms. However, the research involving autonomous boats or Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) for Disaster Management (DM) is currently spread across several publications, with varying degrees of depth, and focusing on more than one unmanned vehicle-usually under the umbrella of Unmanned Marine Vessels (UMV). Therefore, the current importance of USVs for the DM process in its different phases is not clear. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey about the applications and roles of USVs for DM, as far as we know. This work demonstrates that there are few current deployments in disaster scenarios, with most of the research in the area focusing on the technological aspects of USV hardware and software, such as Guidance Navigation and Control, and not focusing on their actual importance for DM. Finally, to guide future research, this paper also summarizes our own contributions, the lessons learned, guidelines, and research gaps.

AB Sensing and communications are dispensable for autonomous vehicles and IoT. One key task in autonomous driving is the sensing of 3D information surrounding a vehicle. Most existing stereo disparity prediction networks pursue accurate disparity maps on high-performance GPUs with high energy consumption. While very few stereo networks achieving real-time on resource-constrained edge devices are hardly satisfactory in terms of accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a lightweight and efficient three-stage stereo disparity prediction network named HRSNet for real-time stereo matching on energy-efficient edge devices with limited resource, reducing energy consumption and requirement on high-performance computing resources. The network consists of a serial patch-embedded feature extractor with short shortcut connections and a depthwise hierarchical refinement. In the stage of refining disparity maps, we employ a novel 2D aggregation network containing expanded depthwise separable convolutions with residual connections to regularize 3D group-wise cost volumes, resulting in accuracy improvement and inference acceleration. By evaluating on KITTI 2015, the proposed network achieves approaching results to state-of-the-art metrics on high-end GPU, and frame-rate@D1-all results of 64.6 FPS@6.16%, 41.7 FPS@3.49%, 32.2 FPS@2.29% in Stages 1-3 on Jetson Nano with ultra-low average power consumption of 6.3 W after tensorRT optimization.

AB Driving requires the ability to handle unpredictable situations. Since it is not always possible to predict an impending danger, a good driver should preventively assess whether a situation has risks and adopt a safe behavior. Considering, in particular, the possibility of a pedestrian suddenly crossing the road, a prudent driver should limit the traveling speed. We present a work exploiting reinforcement learning to learn a function that specifies the safe speed limit for a given artificial driver agent. The safe speed function acts as a behavioral directive for the agent, thus extending its cognitive abilities. We consider scenarios where the vehicle interacts with a distracted pedestrian that might cross the road in hard-to-predict ways and propose a neural network mapping the pedestrian's context onto the appropriate traveling speed so that the autonomous vehicle can successfully perform emergency braking maneuvers. We discuss the advantages of developing a specialized neural network extension on top of an already functioning autonomous driving system, removing the burden of learning to drive from scratch while focusing on learning safe behavior at a highlevel. We demonstrate how the safe speed function can be learned in simulation and then transferred into a real vehicle. We include a statistical analysis of the network's improvements compared to the original autonomous driving system. The code implementing the presented network is available at https://githuh.com/tonegas/safe-speed-neural-network with MIT license and at https://zenodo.org/communities/dreams4cars.

AB Recently, there is an increasing trend to study the impact of anthropomorphism on human trust. However, previous research has shown divergent results. In this study, shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs), an emerging mobility solution, are used to explore the threshold effects of anthropomorphism on human trust. Structural equation modelling is deployed to test the research model based on a valid survey sample of 451 respondents. Results show that a superficial level of anthropomorphism can significantly boost human trust via interaction quality and facilitating condition. By contrast, a deep level of anthropomorphism would decrease human trust. Although the negative effect does not reach statistical significance based on the whole sample, results of the multigroup analysis show that a deep level of anthropomorphism has a significant negative effect on human-SAV interaction quality when respondents possess the following characteristics: (1) male, (2) low-income, (3) low education, or (4) no-vehicle ownership. Regarding theoretical contribution, this study enriches the literature by identifying the threshold effects of anthropomorphism on human trust. Regarding policy and management implications, this study offers some implications on adding anthropomorphic features to SAVs.

AB This study studies coordinated control of a platoon of vehicles consisting of a leader and multiple followers when multiple vehicles suffer from disturbances. Small disturbances acting on one vehicle may cause large spacing errors between intervehicles. In addition, the spacing errors propagate up or down in a vehicle platoon. To mitigate the adverse effect of the disturbances, a control law is proposed based on only the position information of the vehicle itself and its preceding vehicle. To analyse the disturbances propagation among the platoon, the upper bounds of two transfer functions are presented including the transfer function matrix o?'C-de from external disturbances to spacing errors as well as the transfer function matrix o?'C-ue from a leader's input control to spacing errors. Furthermore, an alternative control law is proposed when the velocity of the leader is known by the followers. In this case, two tighter upper bounds of o?'C-de(l) and o?'C-ue(l) are presented. The derived upper bounds of the transfer functions are independent of the number of vehicles in the platoon. Simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Relatively inexpensive vehicles and public policies that favored a vehicle-centric infrastructure facilitated the movement of families from the confines of urban centers to the periphery of cities in the twentieth century. This phenomenon became known as the first wave of urban sprawl. Its negative effects inspired local policymakers to develop a playbook to fight it, including measures such as zoning and pricing mechanisms directed at commuters, developers, and real estate owners. The advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in the twenty-first century promises to benefit society in many ways, including reducing congestion and improving access to transportation. Alternatively, this technology may also instigate a new sprawl that jeopardizes the most important source of local government revenue, property taxes. Using scenario development, this article explores the consequences of a future where residents are willing to trade their AV-generated time savings for homes outside of their local government's jurisdiction, depriving these entities of valuable property tax revenue. It examines how the US policy playbook developed to curtail the first generation of urban sprawl fares in limiting the revenue repercussions of a theoretic AV-induced sprawl.

AB The paper presents a microsimulation approach for assessing the safety performance of turbo-roundabouts where Cooperative Autonomous Vehicles "CAVs" have been introduced into the traffic mix alongside conventional vehicles "CVs". Based on the analysis of vehicle trajectories from VISSIM and subsequent analysis of traffic conflicts through the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM), the research aims to evaluate the safety benefits of turbo-roundabouts where the lanes are physically separated by raised curbs, compared to roundabouts without such curbs. The paper will then describe the methodological path followed to build VISSIM models of turbo-roundabouts with and without raised curbs in order to calibrate the simulation models and estimate the potential conflicts when a higher percentage of CAVs are introduced into the traffic mix. A criterion has been also proposed for setting properly the principal SSAM filters. The results confirmed both higher safety levels for turbo-roundabouts equipped with raised lane dividers compared to turbo-roundabout solutions without curbs, and better safety conditions under the traffic mix of CVs and CAVs. Therefore, it follows that, in absence of crash data including CAVs, the surrogate measures of safety are the only approach in which the safety performance of any roundabout or road entity can be evaluated.

AB As the general development trend of the automotive industry, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can be used to increase transportation safety, promote mobility choices, reduce user costs, and create new job opportunities. However, with the increasing level of connectivity and automation, malicious users are able to easily implement different kinds of attacks, which threaten the security of CAVs. Hence, this paper provides a comprehensive survey on the cyber-security in the environment of CAVs with the aim of highlighting security problems and challenges. Firstly, based on the types of communication networks and attack objects, it classifies various cyber-security risks and vulnerabilities in the environment of CAVs into in-vehicle network attacks, vehicle to every thing network attacks, and other attacks. Next, it regards cyber-risk as another type of attacks in the environment of CAVs. Then, it describes and analyzes up-to-date corresponding defense strategies for securing CAVs. In addition, it concludes several available cyber-security and safety standards of CAVs, which is helpful for the practical application of CAVs. Finally, several challenges and open problems are discussed for the future research.

AB The research of unmanned surface vehicles (usually called USV) is becoming a research hotspot, and real-time and accurate environmental perception is the key technology for achieving autonomous navigation and completing tasks of USV. In this paper, aiming at the technical problems of environmental perception of the USV, from the perspective of sensor multi-information fusion, we build a complete USV perception system (hardware platform and software system). This paper mainly studies objects on the water detection and obstacle avoidance methods based on the information fusion of lidar and vision. In addition, we also studies the method based on morphology to process the reflection of the objects on the water, and the sea-sky detection based on support vector machine (SVM) to assist the objects on the water detection. Through the construction of the USV environment perception system, improving the ability of USV environment perception, and ensuring the safety of autonomous navigation of USV. Our proposed methods have been tested by simulation experiments and actual marine experiment as well as the Hawaii Unmanned Surface Vehicles Challenge, which proves the practicability and stability of our method in the actual environment.

AB This paper studies the joint fleet sizing and charging system planning problem for a company operating a fleet of autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) for passenger and goods transportation. Most of the relevant published papers focus on intracity scenarios and adopt heuristic approaches, e.g., agent based simulation, which do not guarantee optimality. In contrast, we propose a mixed integer linear programming model for intercity scenarios. This model incorporates comprehensive considerations of 1) limited AEV driving range; 2) optimal AEV routing and relocating operations; 3) time-varying origin-destination transport demands; and 4) differentiated operation cost structure of passenger and goods transportation. The proposed model can be computational expensive when the scale of the transportation network is large. We then exploit the structure of this program to expedite its solution. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the proposed method. Our experimental results show that AEVs in passenger and goods transportation have remarkable planning and operation differences. We also demonstrate that intelligent routing and relocating operations, charging system and vehicle parameters, e.g., charging power, battery capacity, driving speed etc., can significantly affect the economic efficiency and the planning results of an AEV fleet.

AB This paper developed a scalable parallel computing method that can be used for platoon simulations and controller validations. A scalable adaptive platooning control law was firstly designed, which accommodates a variety of vehicle-to-vehicle communication topologies. A road vehicle dynamics model that considered the Magic Formula tyre model and suspension dynamics was then derived and validated. The parallel computing method adopted the Message Passing Interface technique to allow fast and scalable simulations. Platoon length changes do not require controller and algorithm changes. An 11-vehicle platoon on a real-world 10 km long road section was simulated. Different localisation sensor errors, communication delays, heterogenous vehicle masses and driving modes were considered. Results show that localisation errors have negligible influences on space errors. Aggressive driving and heterogeneous vehicle masses slightly increase space errors (increases less than 0.23 m). Communication delays are the greatest influencer for space errors. Increases for 15, 45 and 75 ms delays were 0.43, 1.41 and 2.41 m, respectively. It is further shown that parallel computing can improve the computing speed by three times on personal computers and seven to 12 times on workstations.

AB A vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cooperative trajectory-planning algorithm for connected vehicles driven on a winding road considering characteristics of human drivers is presented in this paper. The algorithm of cooperative game is introduced to plan collision-free trajectories for the involved encountering vehicles, with satisfaction of the safety requirements including vehicle stability and road-departure avoidance. The trajectory-planning algorithm is then converted to a Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem and solved with the concept of Pareto Optimality. The algorithm is compared with a V2V trajectory-planning algorithm with non-cooperative game. Simulations are conducted in the scenarios of lane-exchange on arc shaped roads with different radius to verify the proposed algorithm. Results show that the algorithm can accomplish the task of trajectory-planning on either winding road or straight road successfully, considering the driver's characteristics. The difference of collaboration tendency in V2V driving between using cooperative algorithm and non-cooperative algorithm is also studied and described.

AB This paper presents a comparison among path tracking controllers on low-friction roads for autonomous vehicles. There are two goals in this paper. The first is to check the performance of path tracking controllers on low-friction roads, and the second is to check the effectiveness of four-wheel steering (4WS) for path tracking. To fully investigate the performance of path-tracking controllers on low-friction roads in this paper, the pure pursuit method, Stanley method, PID control, linear quadratic regulator, sliding mode control and model predictive control are designed and compared in terms of some measures. Front and four-wheel steering are adopted as actuators for path tracking. To utilize 4WS in the pure pursuit method, Stanley method and PID control, a yaw rate tracking control is adopted. With the designed path tracking controllers, a simulation is conducted on vehicle simulation software. From the simulation results, it is shown that most path tracking controllers are effective for path tracking on low-friction roads if finely tuned, and that 4WS is not recommended for path tracking on low-friction roads.

AB This article deals with the issue of tracking a reference optimal trajectory for an autonomous nonlinear vehicle model by designing both lateral and longitudinal robust feedback control and a suited feedforward control. In previous works, a strategy based on a human-driver field of view was used to plan an optimal trajectory reference. The optimization has been made using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), and the obtained trajectory has been injected into a Potential Field (PF) so as to be reactive to unforeseen events by using a point mass model. Here, the previously developed GA-PF planification process is integrated in a new complete global planning and tracking method and applied to a validation nonlinear vehicle model. This control tracking method is developed in two strategies: a bicycle model is used as model inversion for feedforward design and a robust control is designed as feedback control in order to take the vehicle (mass and velocity) and road (slope and adherence) parameter variations into account. A lateral nonlinear control and a longitudinal robust control are designed. Realistic autonomous car simulation results are provided on an overtaking scenario and a round-about scenario.

AB Motion sickness is a common disease encountered in traditional vehicles as well as autonomous vehicles, which will negatively affect user acceptance. To make clear the pathogenesis of motion sickness, this study focused on drivers' brain activity changes before and after motion sickness happens. Based on the six-degree-of-freedom driving simulator and noninvasive functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a database containing driving operation data synchronized with drivers' brain activity record from 52 participants was collected under straight and curved driving conditions. The correlation analysis between motion sickness and changes of cerebral oxyhemoglobin concentration in the cerebral cortex was carried out based on this database. Results suggest that brain activity associated with motion sickness may differ under different driving conditions. However, the emergence of motion sickness responses is related to the occipital lobe under both driving conditions. Experimental results corroborate with several theoretical hypothesis about motion sickness in neuroscience. Consequently, this study proposes a new approach to research the mechanism of the correlation between motion sickness and cerebral cortex activity, which will contribute to developing the driving assistance system for preventing or alleviating motion sickness in autonomous vehicles.

AB This article presents a fuzzy controller for autonomous vehicle to intelligently recognize running environment and avoid an obstacle, which is constructed by rough sets (RSs) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Firstly, RSs are considered to propose a pyramid normalization (PN) method for normalizing state parameters (SPs) which are defined to recognize relative position such as distance and angle among a vehicle, an obstacle and target pathway, to improve the adaptability of complex environment and optimize the database of driving knowledge. Secondly, ANFIS is employed to design a controller with self-position azimuth correction (SPAC) for performing trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance. Finally, the proposed methods have been implemented on the model vehicle called "RoboCar'', and compared with various fuzzy control approaches such as the initial SPs with ANFIS, the normalized SPs with fuzzy neural network (FNN), and the initial SPs with FNN. Time, maximum tracking error and mean tracking error are calculated to evaluate the performance. The experimental results with four kinds of target pathways have shown that the PN-ANFIS-based controller has saved time (7.6%), reduced maximum tracking error (8.1%) and mean tracking error (8.5%).

AB The development of new technologies that allow us to know more precisely real-time public transport (PT) passenger demand enables the introduction of new methodologies to improve autonomous shuttle bus service (ASBS) from the perspective of both the user and the operator. This work develops a new methodology to determine the optimized PT timetable integrated with vehicle scheduling, including the possibility of using the skip-stop tactic based on real-time passenger demand. The consideration of a skip-stop operation allows for a reduction in the passengers' total travel time and in the number of autonomous shuttle vehicles in use. The analysis is based on the deficit function (DF) graphical concept and considers the constraints of the vehicle with regard to capacity. The methodology is developed for a single-depot bidirectional circle ASBS route using the DF as a multi-decision choice model. Because of the complexity involved in large-size genetic algorithm problems, a binary-variable iteration method is applied to attain efficient solutions. A case study in Auckland, New Zealand, is employed to assess the new model. The case study shows a reduction of 1.83% in total passenger travel time and 8.11% in the number of vehicles as compared to solutions that do not consider the skip-stop tactic. Moreover, it is shown that the advanced DF-based methodology could be used to develop fully autonomous PT in a network in the future.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to eliminate many driver errors to save thousands of lives. As vulnerable road users, pedestrians and bicyclists are more likely to be injured or killed in accidents involving cars. Therefore, understanding the perceptions of vulnerable road users is crucial for developing and deploying AVs and solving public concerns because the acceptance of AVs relies on both AV users and other road users, such as vulnerable road users. This paper analyzed two surveys collected in 2017 and 2019 by BikePGH in Pittsburgh to understand vulnerable road users' perceptions of AVs in different years. The analysis showed that vulnerable road users' interactive experiences with AVs increased from 2017 to 2019 in Pittsburgh, and the interactive experiences with AVs positively affected vulnerable road users' perceived safety and receptivity toward AVs in 2017 and 2019. Specifically, vulnerable road users' perceived safety of AVs significantly increased from 2017 to 2019, while their receptivity toward AVs did not change significantly during that period. Additionally, autonomous driving accidents negatively affected vulnerable road users' perceptions of AVs. Therefore, we recommend that policymakers provide opportunities for the public to interact with AVs and guarantee vulnerable road users' safety and benefits in AV testing.

AB Visuospatial working memory is a fundamental cognitive capability of human beings needed for exploring the visual environment. This cognitive function is responsible for creating visuospatial maps, which are useful for maintaining a coherent and continuous representation of visual and spatial relationships among objects present in the external world. A bio-inspired computational model of Visuospatial Working Memory (VSWM) is proposed in this paper to endow Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with this cognitive function. The VSWM model was implemented on a low-cost commercial drone. A total of 30 test cases were designed and executed. These test cases were grouped into three scenarios: (i) environments with static and dynamic vehicles, (ii) environments with people, and (iii) environments with people and vehicles. The visuospatial ability of the VSWM model was measured in terms of the ability to classify and locate objects in the environment. The VSWM model was capable of maintaining a coherent and continuous representation of visual and spatial relationships among interest objects presented in the environment even when a visual stimulus is lost because of a total occlusion. The VSWM model proposed in this paper represents a step towards autonomous UAVs capable of forming visuospatial mental imagery in realistic environments.

AB We present the design and implementation of a real-time, vision-based landing algorithm for an autonomous helicopter. The landing algorithm is integrated with algorithms for visual acquisition of the target (a helipad) and navigation to the target, from an arbitrary initial position and orientation. We use vision for precise target detection and recognition, and a combination of vision and Global Positioning System for navigation. The helicopter updates its landing target parameters based on vision and uses an onboard behavior-based controller to follow a path to the landing site. We present significant results from flight trials in the field which demonstrate that our detection, recognition, and control algorithms are accurate, robust, and repeatable.

AB This article mainly researches the problem of distributed finite-time coordinated path-following for under-actuated autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) within a network swarm. Each vehicle in swarm system suffers from velocity restrictions and multiple uncertainties including parameter perturbations and time-varying environment disturbances. Based on the constructed bionic swarm pattern and potential function, the swarm velocity guidance (SVG) with self-organization and collision avoidance is developed to guide ASV surge velocities and heading angles simultaneously. A distributed observer by adding correction terms to the vehicle model is involved to identify the lumped uncertainties, and the estimations are utilized as feed-forward compensation to weaken the uncertainty impact, thus achieving high tracking precision. By using asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function, the uncertainty observer based distributed surge and heading kinetics controllers under physical restrictions are devised to guarantee that the guided signals generated by SVG are tracked within finite time. Through simulation studies of swarm path-following, it is demonstrated that the designed control approach is feasible and efficient for multiple uncertain under-actuated ASVs. (C) 2020 ISA.

AB Accurately predicting trajectory of vehicles is a key capability for autonomous vehicles during real-world driving scenarios, which requires the autonomous vehicles to perceive the surrounding environment and analyze the track histories to judge the driving intentions of the focused surrounding vehicles in order to make decisions for the next trajectory route. In this paper, we propose a hybrid attentional trajectory prediction model incorporating both temporal attentional and spatial attentional mechanisms, which has a temporal attentional model that can be used to capture important temporal information affecting trajectory prediction and a spatial attentional mechanism that can better introduce spatial dependencies and potential driving intention information of surrounding and target vehicles. The models are evaluated for performance on publicly available highD and NGSIM datasets. By comparing the results with other state-of-the-art models for trajectory prediction, it is found that the model achieves an improvement in prediction performance, indicating that this model can more accurately learn driving information from the spatio-temporal perspective of the target driving vehicle's attention. Further, by qualitatively analyzing the distribution of attention weights from the spatio-temporal perspective, we assessed the interpretability of the model on the maneuverability judgment of the vehicle.

AB The road friction coefficient is a key parameter for autonomous vehicles and vehicle dynamic control. With the development of autonomous vehicles, increasingly, more environmental perception sensors are being installed on vehicles, which means that more information can be used to estimate the road friction coefficient. In this paper, a nonlinear observer aided by vehicle lateral displacement information for estimating the road friction coefficient is proposed. First, the tire brush model is modified to describe the tire characteristics more precisely in high friction conditions using tire test data. Then, on the basis of vehicle dynamics and a kinematic model, a nonlinear observer is designed, and the self-aligning torque of the wheel, lateral acceleration, and vehicle lateral displacement are used to estimate the road friction coefficient during steering. Finally, slalom tests and DLC (Double Line Change) tests in high friction conditions are conducted to verify the proposed estimation algorithm. Test results showed that the proposed method performs well during steering and the estimated road friction coefficient converges to the reference value rapidly.

AB This paper addresses the problem of designing guidance, control and navigation systems for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Its contribution is twofold: i) it introduces a new methodology for the integrated design of guidance and control, and ii) it describes a novel approach to the analysis and design of multi-rate complementary filters for navigation. The methodologies proposed lead to an efficient procedure for the design of controllers for AUVs, to accurately track reference trajectories defined in an inertial reference frame. The paper illustrates the application of that procedure to the design of a tracking controller for the MARIUS AUV. The design phase is summarized, and the performance of the resulting controller is assessed in simulations, using dynamic models of the vehicle and its sensor suite.

AB This paper presents an uncontrolled intersection-passing algorithm with an integrated approach of stochastic model-predictive control and prediction uncertainty estimation for autonomous vehicles. The proposed algorithm is designed to utilize information from sensors mounted on the autonomous vehicle and high-definition intersection maps. The proposed algorithm is composed of two modules, namely target state prediction and a motion planner. The target state prediction module has predicted the future behavior of intersection-approaching vehicles based on human driving data. The recursive covariance estimator has been utilized to estimate the prediction uncertainty for each approaching vehicle. The desired driving mode has been determined based on the uncontrolled intersection theory. The estimated prediction uncertainty has been used to define the probability distribution of the stochastic model-predictive controller to cope with time-varying uncertainty characteristics of the perception algorithm. The constrained stochastic model-predictive controller based on safety indexes has determined the desired longitudinal acceleration. The proposed robust intersection-passing algorithm has been evaluated via computer simulation based on Monte Carlo simulation with a sensor model. The simulation results showed that the proposed algorithm guarantees the minimum safety constraints and improves the ride comfort at uncontrolled intersections by estimating the uncertainty of sensors and prediction.</p>

ID TRANSPORT POVERTY; CHALLENGES; FUTURE
AB Connected, autonomous and electric vehicles (CAEV) are a powerful combined transport technology looking to disrupt the automotive sector and drive the transition to safe, accessible, clean and sustainable transport systems. The trialling of private, public and shared CAEV technologies is occurring in cities around the world; however, historically isolated and transport-poor rural communities may have the most to gain from CAEV implementation. Despite the accessibility and transport safety needs of rural communities, rural CAEV trials are few in the UK. Therefore, this paper investigates the hypothesis that the lack of rural implementation research and trials means that rural transport planners are ill-informed and uncertain of both the potential of CAEVs and their implementation requirements to meet rural community transport needs. This investigation consists of consultations with UK-based transport planning professionals to establish their perspectives on CAEV technologies and their rural implementation potential. The findings show that 96% of transport planners lack sufficient understanding of CAEV technology and its implementation challenges. However, the findings also highlight a willingness, given the opportunity, for transport planners to engage with CAEV technologies and apply them to specifically rural scenarios.

AB This study aims to analyze the impact of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) on traffic safety under various penetration rates. Based on a recently proposed heterogeneous flow model, the mixed traffic flow with both conventional vehicles and CAVs was simulated and studied. The frequency of dangerous situations and value of time-to-collision in the mixed traffic flow under different CAV penetration rates was calculated and used as indicators of CAV's impact on traffic safety. Acceleration rate and velocity difference distribution of the mixed traffic flow was presented to show the evolution of mixed traffic flow dynamics with the increase in CAV penetration rates within the mixed flow. Results show that the condition of traffic safety is greatly improved with the increase in the CAV penetration rate. More cautious car-following strategy of the CAV would contribute to a greater benefit on traffic safety, though less gain in capacity. With the increase in CAV penetration rate, the portion of smooth driving is increased. Velocity difference between vehicles is decreased and traffic flow is greatly smoothed. Stop-and-go traffic will be greatly eased. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DT Article
AB What happens when we endow an autonomous vehicle with a personality? It sounds like a good idea-witty banter, friendly advice, and encouragement from your car. But science fiction writers predicted this technology and both the good and bad scenarios that could arise. A brief sample of some of these situations from American television and film is enlightening but suggests that granting a personality to an auto is ill-advised. This theme issue explores the state and potential benefits and ethical dilemmas of connected and autonomous vehicles. While fully autonomous vehicles are already experimentally deployed, they will become ubiquitous within a few years. Soon after we should see an experimental deployment of vehicles that have a level of artificial intelligence such that they could be considered "sentient" (self-aware) or even "anthropomorphic" (human-like). These vehicles could do much more than self-drive or give us driving advice, travel information, and various forms of infotainment. They could also remind us of important stops to be made, listen to our complaints about traffic and other drivers, and even provide us with soothing advice. And this advice could be given with the benefit of an artificial personality-one that could be formal, friendly, or even replicates that of a famous person, celebrity, or a loved one.

AB In this paper, we present a method for performance evaluation of autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RSs) with tier-captive single-aisle vehicles. A discrete-time open queueing network approach is applied. The data obtained from the evaluation of the lift and vehicle movements can be used directly as input for the general discrete service time distributions of the queueing network. Furthermore, the approach allows for the computation of the retrieval transaction time distribution as well as of the distribution of the number of transactions waiting to be stored. Consequently, not only expected values and variances but also quantiles of the performance measures can be obtained. Comparison to discrete-event simulation quantifies approximation errors resulting from the decomposition approach in the discrete-time domain. Moreover, the errors obtained by the discrete-time approach are compared to the errors obtained using a continuous-time open queueing network approach. Finally, it will be outlined how the model can be used for designing AVS/RSs according to given system requirements, such as storage capacity, throughput, height and length of the system as well as the 95% quantile of the retrieval transaction time.

AB Underwater scene is highly unstructured, full of various noise interferences. Moreover, GPS information is not available in the underwater environment, which thus brings huge challenges to the navigation of autonomous underwater vehicle. As an autonomous navigation technology, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) can deliver reliable localization to vehicles in unknown environment and generate models about their surrounding environment. With the development and utilization of marine and other underwater resources, underwater SLAM has become a hot research topic. By focusing on underwater visual SLAM, this paper reviews the basic theories and research progress regarding underwater visual SLAM modules, such as sensors, visual odometry, state optimization and loop closure detection, discusses the challenges faced by underwater visual SLAM, and shares the prospects of underwater visual SLAM. It is found that the traditional underwater visual SLAM based on filtering methods is gradually developing towards optimization-based methods. Underwater visual SLAM presents a diversified trend, and various new methods have emerged. This paper aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of the current status and development trend of underwater visual SLAM, while offering help for collecting underwater vehicles intelligence.

DE Coverage path plan; Polygon decomposition; Path planner; Trajectory

AB This paper proposes a coverage path planner for the autonomous vehicle used in inspection operation. The proposed coverage path planner is developed based on a back and forth pattern (equivalent to boustrophedon pattern), producing the output path for the inspection operation with the least trajectory length and number of turns covering the entire workspace. Implementing a back and forth pattern on an arbitrary polygon (extracted from workspace boundaries) is not always viable due to the existence of concave vertices in the polygon. So, this work proposes the tree search model based on the polygon width and back and forth pattern's sweep line, which decomposes the input polygon in numerous ways. The Dijkstra algorithm solves this tree model to obtain back and forth pattern viable polygons with the least number of turns. Later, the vehicle visits these polygons one by one during the inspection operation. The order in which polygon visits are made by the vehicle affects the overall trajectory length. So, this work proposes the ant colony optimisation based trajectory length optimiser, which finds the polygon visiting order that yields minimum trajectory length. The developed coverage path planner is versatile, and it applies to any autonomous vehicle that operates in the planar region.

ID OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE; GROUND VEHICLES; MODEL; SPEED
AB In this work, a terrain estimation framework is developed for autonomous vehicles operating on deformable terrains. Previous work in this area usually relies on steady state tire operation, linearized classical terramechanics models, or on computationally expensive algorithms that are not suitable for real-time estimation. To address these shortcomings, this work develops a reduced-order nonlinear terramechanics model as a surrogate of the Soil Contact Model (SCM) through extending a state-of-the-art Bekker model to account for additional dynamic effects. It is shown that this reduced-order surrogate model is able to accurately replicate the forces predicted by the SCM while reducing the computation cost by an order of magnitude. This surrogate model is then utilized in an unscented Kalman filter to estimate the sinkage exponent. Simulations suggest this parameter can be estimated within 4% of its true value for clay and sandy loam terrains. It is also shown in simulation and experiment that utilizing this estimated parameter can reduce the prediction errors of the future vehicle states by orders of magnitude, which could assist with achieving more robust model-predictive autonomous navigation strategies.

The purpose is to obtain optimal trajectories for manoeuvres of Autonomous Surface Vessels. The algorithm works with a model of the vehicle, and the solutions achieved are always feasible. With enough time, it can also obtain trajectories very close to the optimal. Provided the appropriate modifications the algorithm can be applied to solve other combinatorial optimisations problems with a non restricted number of feasible solutions. The methodology is tested through simulations on open sea manoeuvres and scenarios with the presence of obstacles. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Vehicle localization in highway tunnels is challenging for autonomous vehicle navigation. The drift error increases because GPS signals from satellites cannot be received inside a highway tunnel. Therefore, map-aided localization is essential for correcting the drift error. However, the environment around the tunnel is composed mainly of elliptical walls, and there are few unique feature points for map matching, unlike the case outdoors. In this paper, we propose a tunnel facility-based precise vehicle localization method for highway tunnels using 3D LIDAR. For vehicle localization, a point landmark map storing the center points of the tunnel facilities and a probability distribution map storing the probability distributions of the lane markings is used. In the proposed method, the tunnel facility points are extracted using 3D LIDAR, and position estimation is conducted using an extended Kalman filter-based navigation filter. The proposed localization algorithm was verified through experiments using actual highway driving data. The experimental results verify that tunnel facility-based vehicle localization yields precise results in various situations.

AB Recent advances in unmanned and autonomous vehicle technology are accelerating the push to integrate these vehicles into human-centered environments such as commercial aviation and public roads. Much of the current research into autonomous systems examines improving the performance of individual unmanned vehicles or improving the safety of their interactions with individual humans; very little examines the behavior of the broader system. For large-scale transportation systems, real-world field trials involving unmanned vehicles are difficult to execute due to concerns of cost, feasibility of construction, and the maturity of the technologies. This paper describes the use of an agent-based model of unmanned vehicle behavior in human-centered environments to explore the effects of their implementation in these domains. In particular, this work explores how safety protocols governing the integration of manned and unmanned vehicles affect performance in an aircraft carrier ground control environment. Three different types of futuristic unmanned vehicle control architectures are considered in conjunction with four different types of safety protocols: dynamic, area, temporal, and combined area-plus-temporal separation. Results demonstrate that measures of safety vary widely across these systems, demonstrating distinct tradeoffs of safety and mission performance, as well as across different safety measures.

AB In this paper, we present a high-level optimization-based control strategy for the coordination of electric automated vehicles (AVs) in confined sites. A centralized controller optimizes the state and input trajectories of all vehicles in the site such that collisions are avoided in cross-intersections, narrow roads, merge crossings, and charging stations, while also considering the charging process. Specifically, the controller consists of two optimization-based components. The first component is tasked with solving the combinatorial part of the problem, which corresponds to the order in which the vehicles pass the crossings, by solving a Mixed Integer Quadratic Problem (MIQP). The found combinatorial solution is then utilized for calculating the optimal state and input trajectories that are obtained by solving a Nonlinear Program (NLP). The control algorithm is compared with respect to alternative optimization-based approaches in simulation scenarios. For the presented scenario, our method achieves improved energy efficiency by up to 7.6% while slightly improving the average mission end time, and furthermore, it is capable of avoiding deadlocks.

AB In this paper, a distributed formation containment control (FCC) issue is studied for multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (MAUVs) system with prescribed performance based on the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) method in three-dimensional space. The unknown nonlinearities and external disturbances of the MAUVs system are approximated in real time by means of extended state observers (ESOs). Furthermore, tracking differentiators (TDs) are introduced for the sake of refraining from the explosion of complexity induced by the derivatives of the virtual control variables of autonomous underwater vehicles. Applying funnel variables, our designed control strategy ensures the formation tracking errors and containment errors to keep within the specified ranges, hence enhancing the control performance of the MAUVs system. Then, a FCC-ADRC scheme for MAUVs system is proposed. Compared with the traditional FCC scheme, the proposed FCC-ADRC scheme not only does not depend on the specific system configuration, but also can deal with any bounded disturbances, thus obtaining a more general, effective and robust disturbance rejection FCC strategies. Additionally, the stability of MAUVs system is verified through Lyapunov stability analysis. At last, the error curves and time-varying formation containment trajectories obtained by simulation confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of our method.

AB Soon enough, autonomous driving systems may not need drivers at all. Ideally, a passenger can ride an autonomous vehicle (AUV) from one location to another without (either partial or complete) human intervention, inherently removing aberrant human driving behavior from the equation, requiring no or only a few parking spaces near a passenger's destination, and possessing environmental advantages over traditional vehicles powered by internal combustion engines. The current study aims to investigate the interrelationships between influential factors and behavioral intention with regard to AUVs. The research was implemented with: (1) partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to examine path relationships, (2) partial least squares multi-group analysis (PLS-MGA) to elaborate observed heterogeneity, and (3) partial least squares prediction orientation segmentation (PLS-POS) to study unobserved heterogeneity. The empirical results showed significant direct effects for Hypotheses H1-a similar to H1-c (Attitude, Subjective norm, and Perceived Behavior Control on Behavior Intention) and for Hypothesis H3-a (Personal Innovativeness on Behavior Intention). Additionally, the results showed that observed heterogeneity does not exist by gender, and by city, and that unobserved heterogeneity can be best identified and divided into two segments by employing PLS-POS. A few final remarks concern the research findings and preparing for future AUV transportation.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have multiple tasks with different priorities and safety levels where classic supervised learning techniques are no longer applicable. Thus, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms become increasingly appropriate for this domain as the RL algorithms can act on complex problems and adapt their responses in the face of unforeseen situations and environments. The RL agent aims to perform the action that guarantees the optimal reward with the best score. The problem with this approach is if the agent finds a possible optimal action with a reasonable premium and gets stuck in this mediocre strategy, which at the same time is neither the best nor the worst solution. Therefore, the agent avoids performing a more extensive exploration to find new paths and learn alternatives to generate a higher reward. To alleviate this problem, we research the behavior of two types of noise in AVs training. We analyze the results and point out the noise method that most stimulates exploration. A vast exploration of the environment is highly relevant to AVs because they know more about the environment and learn alternative ways of acting in the face of uncertainties. With that, AVs can expect more reliable actions in front of sudden changes in the environment. According to our experiments' results in a simulator, we can see that noise allows the autonomous vehicle to improve its exploration and increase the reward.

AB Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) has become a preferred option particularly for controlling a strongly nonlinear system due to an increase in the availability of powerful cheap computing resources in recent years. However, there are still some hurdles to widely apply the NMPC algorithm for fast nonlinear dynamic systems. One of the primary challenges is how to quickly solve a set of nonlinear differential model equations and a nonlinear dynamic optimization problem in real time. A large portion of the computational problems arises from gradient vector and Hessian matrix derivations and evaluations. In this paper, the problem has been handled using an advanced symbolic computation tool called SymPy. With the symbolic computation, the complex gradient vector, Hessian matrix, and nonlinear dynamic optimization problem are derived analytically and evaluated with machine accuracy. As the rising need for a higher safety level, autonomous marine surface vehicles have been vastly used for various applications in recent years. It is known that model-free methods such as proportional-integral-derivative and nonlinear sliding mode controls are not sufficient to provide a robust control for a highly nonlinear surface vehicles. In this paper, the developed NMPC algorithm has been adopted to solve the two- dimensional trajectory tracking problem for an autonomous marine surface vehicle.

AB Motion planning is an essential part of autonomous vehicles. The planning process should respond to environmental changes in real time to ensure safety. This paper proposes an event-triggered real-time motion planning strategy to achieve a more real-time planning effect and a scenario-based planning process. The path planning process is discretized into several parts and integrated into the behavioral planning process. A hierarchical finite state machine (HFSM) based integrated motion planning process is proposed to trigger the discrete path planning parts according to environmental events. Thus, the output reference path can be obtained. Experiment and simulation results show the efficiency of our strategy.

AB The visual camera in the autonomous vehicles is inadequate to capture a prominent image of objects, especially in the night. The headlights of the car also have limited perceptibility up to few meters. So, it is utterly essential to implement such a technique so that visibility in the night would also be cleared as crystal. In this paper, a thermal imaging camera is proposed to be felicitated in autonomous vehicles for better identification of objects especially in the night when visibility is very less. This technique is framed to use as a data acquisition tool to recognize the objects. Due to the huge variation in grayscales and pseudo coloring values in the thermal image, a fuzzy-based CNN model is proposed to be applied to identify the boundaries of the objects. In this technique, the correlation between the thermal images of the moving object and its types is proposed to be trained with the novel FCNN model. The acquired data from different scenarios would also be compared with driving safety experts. By inter-connecting these practices, a novel and unique real-time thermographic image processing would be framed for the autonomous vehicle system. The proposed technique is implemented in a grayscaled thermal image to verify the process and its analysis indicates the robustness of the proposed method.

AB The transition to connected and autonomous (or automated) vehicles (CAVs) in the United States is used to explore the role of civil society in the acceleration and deceleration of sociotechnical transitions. This is an "incumbent-led transition," which occurs when large industrial corporations in one or more industries lead a systemic technological change. This type of transition may generate public concerns about risk and uncertainty, which can be expressed and mobilized by civil society organizations (CSOs). In turn, CSOs may also attempt to decelerate the transition process in order to develop better regulation and to change technology design. Based on an analysis of CSO statements in the public sphere and media reports on CAVs in the U.S., the political strategy of CSOs is examined to improve understanding of the role of civil society in incumbent-led transitions. The analysis indicates that the strategy includes four main aspects: articulating an alternative political goal (slower introduction of advanced autonomous vehicles and more rapid introduction of existing driver-assisted technology), engaging multiple targets or venues of action (different government units and the private sector), forming and expanding a broad coalition, and selecting effective tactics of influence (lobbying, media outreach, and research involving public opinion polls).

AB An autonomous positioning method independent of satellites is introduced in this study. When the location of vehicles cannot be covered by navigation satellites or the signals of navigation satellites are denied or under disturbance, the presented method can offer accurate position information for the vehicles. The designed system contains two parts: a star sensor that determines the attitude of the vehicle through starlight imaging, and a dual-axis inclinometer that measures the tilt angle between the vehicle and the horizontal plane. In addition, a precision clock is needed to provide current time and synchronize the data from the star sensor and the inclinometer. Base on principle of star sensor and inclinometer, the measurement model of the system is established and error analysis is carried out. It is noticed that the systematic error caused by the misalignment of the star sensor and the inclinometer influences the positioning accuracy significantly. In order to eliminate this systematic error, a calibration method based on QUEST (QUaternion ESTimator) is proposed to obtain the misalignment matrix and refine measurement model. The night sky experiments prove the proposed calibration method is effective, and the autonomous positioning system can achieve accuracy of 20-70 m in distance by continuous measurement in several minutes.

AB See-and-avoid behaviors are an essential part of autonomous navigation for Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs). To be fully autonomous, a UAV must be able to navigate complex urban and near-earth environments and detect and avoid imminent collisions. While there have been significant research efforts in robotic navigation and obstacle avoidance during the past few years, this previous work has not focused on applications that use small autonomous UAVs. Specific UAV requirements such as non-invasive sensing, light payload, low image quality, high processing speed, long range detection, and low power consumption, etc., must be met in order to fully use this new technology. This paper presents single camera collision detection and avoidance algorithm. Whereas most algorithms attempt to extract the 3D information from a single optical flow value at each feature point, we propose to calculate a set of likely optical flow values and their associated probabilities-an optical flow probability distribution. Using this probability distribution, a more robust method for calculating object distance is developed. This method is developed for use on a UAV to detect obstacles, but it can be used on any vehicle where obstacle detection is needed.

AB A set-membership algorithm is presented for tracking of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) from acoustic time-of-flight measurements received by a field of surface floating buoys. The algorithm assumes that measurement errors and AUV dynamics uncertainties are of unknown but bounded magnitude, with known bounds, and produces as output the set of admissible AUV positions. The proposed procedure has been validated by simulations in which uncertainty models have been obtained from field data at sea. Tracking performance is shown superior than that of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in presence of biased disturbances.

AB This paper studies a trajectory-based traffic management (TTM) problem for the purpose of managing traffic in a road facility reserved exclusively for autonomous vehicles (AV). The base TTM model aims to find optimal trajectories for multiple AVs while resolving inter-vehicle conflicts in the most generic way. The model is formulated as a mixed integer program (MIP) that can be solved using off-the-shelf solvers. To improve computational efficiency, a specialized algorithm based on the rolling horizon approach is also developed. We then show that the base TTM model can be easily extended to first accommodate scheduling decisions (the rrms model) and to further impose equity constraints (the TTMSE model). For the simplest network and homogeneous users, solutions to TTMS and TTMSE are similar, respectively, to system optimal (SO) and user equilibrium (UE) solutions of Vickrey's bottleneck model. Numerical experiments highlight TTM's ability to simultaneously generate optimal trajectories for multiple vehicles. They also show that, while solving TTM exactly is computationally demanding, obtaining good approximate solutions can be accomplished efficiently by the rolling horizon algorithm.

AB This paper presents the model identification and the velocity control of an autonomous car. The control system was designed so that the car is controlled at low speeds, where the main applications for the vehicle's autonomous operations include parking and urban adaptive cruise control. A longitudinal model of the car was used in the control loop to compensate the nonlinear behavior of its dynamics. Since the determination of the vehicle's model is a difficult step in the design of model-based controllers, the main contribution of this paper is the use of an empirically determined model to this end. In this paper, the structure of the model was conceived from the car's physics equations, but its parameters were estimated using data-based identification techniques. An important contribution of this paper is the fact that, although the model is strictly linear, we can change its parameters as a function of the operation point of the vehicle to represent the engine's and the transmission's nonlinear behaviors. Moreover, in this paper, we propose a way to include changes in the longitudinal dynamics caused by the automatic gear shifting. The validation of the proposed controller was conducted by computer simulations and real-world experiments.

AB Transportation has been experiencing disruptive forces in recent years. One key disruption is the development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) that will be capable of navigating roadways on their own without the need for human presence in the vehicle. In a utopian scenario, AVs may enter the transportation landscape and foster a more sustainable and livable ecosystem with shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEV) serving mobility needs and eliminating the need for private ownership. In a more dystopian scenario, AVs would be personally owned by households-enabling people to live farther away from destinations, inducing additional travel, and roaming roadways with zero occupants. Concerned with the potential deleterious effects of having personal AVs running errands autonomously, this paper aims to shed light on the level of interest in sending AVs to run errands and how that variable affects the intent to own an AV. Using data from a survey conducted in 2019 in four automobile-oriented metropolitan regions in the United States, the relationship is explored through a joint model system estimated using the generalized heterogeneous data model (GHDM) methodology. Results show that even after accounting for socio-economic and demographic variables as well as latent attitudinal constructs, the level of interest in having AVs run errands has a positive and significant effect on AV ownership intent. The findings point to the need for policies that would steer the entry and use of AVs in the marketplace in ways that avoid a dystopian future.

AB This paper discusses the application of a novel multivariable control technique to the problem of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) autopilot design. Based on an adaptive neural network structure a multivariable Sugeno style fuzzy inference system is tuned to produce a course-changing and roll minimizing autopilot. Simulation results, performed using a full non-linear six degree of freedom model, illustrate the effectiveness of this new approach when compared to a more traditional control approach which makes no provision for the inherent cross coupling between AUV yaw and roll channels.

The main contributions of this work are the following. 1) A methodology based on the controllers' parameters for creating comfortable driving styles that can be used as autonomous cars' operation modes. 2) A proposal to use virtual reality as a testbed for the evaluation of driving styles by users. 3) As an illustration of our methodology, we determine and evaluate distinguishable driving styles by partitioning the time-to-collision parameter of the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) controller using the Just Noticeable Difference (JND). 4) A proposal of four driving styles that are equally preferable among passengers.

AB The rapid development of marine robotic technology in recent decades has resulted in significant improvements in the self-sufficiency of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). However, simple scenario-based approaches are no longer sufficient when it comes to ensuring the efficient interaction of multiple autonomous vehicles in complex dynamic missions. The necessity to respond cooperatively to constant changes under severe operating constraints, such as energy or communication limitations, results in the challenge of developing intelligent adaptive approaches for planning and organizing group activities. The current study presents a novel hierarchical approach to the group control system designed for large heterogeneous fleets of AUVs. The high-level core of the approach is rendezvous-based mission planning and is aimed to effectively decompose the mission, ensure regular communication, and schedule AUVs recharging activities. The high-level planning problem is formulated as an original acyclic variation of the inverse shift scheduling problem, which is NP-hard. Since regular schedule adjustments are supposed to be made by the robots themselves right in the course of the mission, a meta-heuristic hybrid evolutionary algorithm is developed to construct feasible sub-optimal solutions in a short time. The high efficiency of the proposed approach is shown through a series of computational experiments.

AB One of the key solutions to resolving the traffic congestion problem is the traffic management systems, aiming to increase the efficiency of the road networks so that the traffic flow condition on the road segment is improved. Integration of the advancements in communication and autonomous vehicle technologies might increase the benefits of the existing real-time traffic management systems. Hence, in this study, the advantages of six different real-time traffic management methods, which are dynamic speed limits, lane control systems, variable message signs, ramp metering, traffic diversion, and integrating autonomous vehicles into other traffic management systems, with four main criteria, namely economic, public and political, environmental, and traffic safety, and 13 sub-criteria using fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) are prioritized. For this purpose, we propose novel extensions of the combined compromise solution (CoCoSo) methodology, including the logarithmic method and the Power Heronian function. The validation of the results is presented to verify the flexibility of the proposed methodology. Finally, these results of the effect of parameters p and q on decision outcome show that the ranking results were not influenced.

AB In future mobility environment, virtual drivers of autonomous vehicles should be monitored for the sake of safety by evaluating their driving behaviors. Evaluating human drivers of non-autonomous vehicles also can be helpful to improve performance of safety control systems. This paper evaluates driving behaviors based on transition probabilities among multiple driving modes. We estimate transition probabilities with likelihoods of multiple modes from an interacting multiple model by proposing an online estimation approach. The proposed approach addresses the numerical issue found in our preliminary work, and it is verified with an extensive simulation. Furthermore, we evaluate driving behaviors by utilizing the estimated transition probabilities. The proposed method of driving behavior evaluation is demonstrated experimentally.

AB Taking full advantage of tire saturation in high sideslip drifting maneuvers can substantially improve the handling limits of autonomous vehicles. However, most singular motion control methods in conventional drifting controllers have been conducted, which cannot meet general driving needs. In this article, a hierarchical dynamic drifting controller (HDDC) is designed under both drifting maneuvers and typical cornering maneuvers to uniformly track the general path within and beyond stability limits. Specifically, the HDDC includes the path tracking layer, vehicle motion control layer, and actuator regulating layer. The first layer is designed to achieve accurate path tracking and generate the desired states, and it is algorithmically adaptable and confirmed by MPC and LQR. The second layer is proposed to integrate drifting and typical cornering control by the dynamic drifting inverse model. The third layer can achieve the steering system and wheel speed control to satisfy corresponding commands. Ultimately, the real-time performance of the controller is verified by the ECU hardware-in-the-loop platform. The results with MPC-HDDC and LQR-HDDC show that the HDDC can achieve integrated control of drifting and typical cornering maneuvers and possess high tracking accuracy.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) and their potential impact on the transformation of the built environment of cities have become a topic of interest across disciplines. Despite policy and design implications, realistic projections of future urban landscape changes were primarily obtained based on street-scale design in earlier studies, leaving questions about the successful integration of repurposed urban elements. This study aimed to formulate design strategies in an incremental fashion applicable to large areas of cities to enhance the connectivity between AVs and existing transportation modes. A conceptual model was built referring to blocks of different forms and functions in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, to extend our designs from the street level to the district level. Urban ele-ments-streets, public spaces and transit systems-were redesigned and merged into the patchwork concept, which links different street and zone types as an efficient system. The above urban design concept proposes the separation of AVs and regular vehicles and adopts unique linkage structures to effectively connect zones assigned to AV usage. The strategies and designs developed in this study contribute to the limited studies on city-scale future AV projections and provide spatial implications as a guideline to address preparations considering AVs in the urban space.

AB This article presents a reliable and robust rapidly exploring random tree (R2-RRT*) algorithm to tackle challenges in mission planning of off-road autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) under uncertain terrain environment. Two types of mobility reliability metrics, namely state mobility reliability (SMR) and mission mobility reliability (MMR), are first defined to quantify the mobility reliability of an AGV and to incorporate mobility reliability into mission planning. SMR measures the probability that a vehicle can pass through a specific location on a map of interest, whereas MMR quantifies mobility reliability of a mission path with the consideration of dependence of soil properties and slope over space. Based on the defined SMR and MMR metrics, two reliability-based robust mission planning models are developed to identify optimal paths that have robust travel time and satisfy specific reliability requirements. Moreover, a reliability-based path smoothing algorithm is developed to address the suboptimality of R2-RRT*. Results of a case study demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed models and algorithms.

AB The paper addresses the problem of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) modelling and parameter estimation as a means to predict the dynamic performance of underwater vehicles and thus provide solid guidelines during their design phase. The use of analytical and semi-empirical (ASE) methods to estimate the hydrodynamic derivatives of a popular class of AUVs is discussed. A comparison is done with the results obtained by using computational fluid dynamics to evaluate the bare hull lift force distribution around a fully submerged body. An application is made to the estimation of the hydrodynamic derivatives of the MAYA AUV, an autonomous underwater vehicle developed under a joint Indian-Portuguese project. The estimates obtained were used to predict the turning diameter of the vehicle during sea trials. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The probabilistic prediction of road traffic scenarios is addressed. One result is a probabilistic occupancy of traffic participants, and the other result is the collision risk for autonomous vehicles when executing a planned maneuver. The probabilistic occupancy of surrounding traffic participants helps to plan the maneuver of an autonomous vehicle, whereas the computed collision risk helps to decide if a planned maneuver should be executed. Two methods for the probabilistic prediction are presented and compared: 1) Markov chain abstraction and 2) Monte Carlo simulation. The performance of both methods is evaluated with respect to the prediction of the probabilistic occupancy and the collision risk. For each comparison test, we use the same models that generate the probabilistic behavior of traffic participants, where the generation of these data is not compared with real-world data. However, the results independently show the behavior generation that Markov chains are preferred for the probabilistic occupancy, whereas Monte Carlo simulation is clearly preferred for determining the collision risk.

AB Internet of autonomous unmanned vehicles (IAUV) is a global network of sensors, robots, and autonomous vehicles. Person re-identification (Re-ID) is an important intelligent transportation application in IAUV, which needs to be solved using artificial intelligence algorithms. In this study, a domain adaptation metric learning method embedded with structural information (called DAML-ESI) is designed for person Re-ID in IAUV. Due to the lack of labeling information in the target domain, DAML-ESI realizes person Re-ID with the help of the discriminative and structural information of pedestrian images of related domains. DAML-ESI projects pedestrian images selected from different domains into a common metric space and establishes a discriminative metric learning model, which requires that the positive sample pair be mapped to a point, and the distance distribution of the negative sample pair be mapped to a fixed value. The projection matrix learned by DAML-ESI is used to eliminate the distribution differences between different domains, and the distance metric is used to ensure that the learned metric learning model has strong discriminative ability in the metric space. To verify the effectiveness of DAML-ESI, experimental comparisons are conducted on three person Re-ID datasets, and DAML-ESI achieves satisfactory recognition performance.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Field experiments of autonomous driving systems have already been started in several countries around the world. However, investigations on the performance of signalized intersections under the mixed flow condition of autonomous vehicle (AV) and human-driven vehicle (HDV) are still very limited, especially in terms of considering the interaction between vehicles. This study aims at developing a methodology to evaluate the efficiency and safety performance of signalized intersections under the conditions of AV mixed flows. If AVs are set aggressively such as small critical gap acceptance thresholds, approach capacity of signalized intersections may increase. However, the aggressive driving maneuver and the misjudgment by human drivers to AV may lead to some potential safety risks. On the other hand, if AVs are set conservatively to ensure large safety margins, for example by setting large critical gap thresholds or a longer following headway, a significant drop in the capacity is expected while the safety improvements may not be insured since extra delays will be imposed on HDVs which may induce risky behavior. This study finds that AVs with either excessively aggressive or conservative settings will lead to waste of capacity or potential safety hazard. AVs with aggressive settings will enable them to accept a short gap or lag, while AVs with conservative settings will increase the waiting time of the following HDVs, which may induce aggressive driving behavior. Both types of AV settings may contribute to safety risks represented by short time-to-collision and short post encroachment time.

AB This paper describes an autonomous guidance system based on receding horizon (RH) optimization. The system is integrated around a spatial, state-dependent cost-to-go (SVF) function that is computed as an approximation to the value function associated with the optimal trajectory planning problem. The function captures the critical interaction between the vehicle dynamics and environment, thereby resulting in tighter coupling between planning and control. The consistency achieved between the RH optimization and the SVF enables a more rigorous implementation of the RH framework to autonomous vehicle guidance. The paper describes the overall approach along flight experimental results obtained in an Interactive Guidance and Control Laboratory. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In 2016, the 4th industrial revolution, represented by hyper-connected and hyper-intelligent technologies, began, and the global automobile industry is now focusing on the development of smart cars, such as driverless vehicles, connected vehicles, and electric vehicles. In particular, as electric vehicles with autonomous driving features are to be manufactured and sold, the precise prediction of driving distances has become more important. If the actual driving distance is shorter than the prediction of the available driving distance, the autonomous vehicle will stop on the way to its destination. Moreover, the route for electric vehicles should be determined by considering the location of charging stations and available driving distance. Existing studies about the expected driving distance do not appropriately reflect all of the various circumstances, components, and variables, thus restricting their predictive performance. In particular, current methods do not precisely predict the running resistance of electric vehicles, or changes in driving distance caused by the use of electrical functions in such vehicles. Thus, a vehicle energy model for predicting the exact driving distance of an electric vehicle is described in this paper, considering the driving speed, road status, tire pressure, temperature, driving altitude, regenerative braking, and other factors. Finally, the proposed model for predicting the driving distance of electric vehicles was confirmed to be feasible by an in-vehicle test on real roads.

AB We proposed a light detection and ranging (LIDAR) system that changes the measurement strategy from a LIDAR system of sequential emission and measuring method to a concurrent firing measuring method. The proposed LIDAR was a 3D scanning LIDAR method that consisted of 128 output channels in one vertical line in the measurement direction and concurrently measured the distance for each of these 128 channels. The scanning LIDAR emitted 128 laser pulse streams encoded by carrier-hopping prime code (CHPC) technology with identification and checksum. When the reflected pulse stream was received and demodulated, the emission channel could be recognized. This information could be used to estimate the time when the laser pulse stream was emitted and calculate the distance to the object reflecting the laser. By using the identification of the received reflected wave, even if several positions were measured at the same time, the measurement position could be recognized after the reception. Extensive simulations indicated that the proposed LIDAR could provide autonomous vehicles or autonomous walking robots with good distance images to recognize the environment ahead.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AV) may become widely diffused as a road transport technology around the world. However, two conditions of successful adoption of AVs are that they must be synchronously shared, to avoid negative transport network and environmental consequences, and that high levels of public acceptance of the technology must exist. The implications of these two conditions are that travellers must accept sharing rides with unfamiliar others in Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAV). Two factors that have been identified as being positive influencers of acceptance are comfort and trust. The present paper undertakes a novel examination as to how comfort and trust ratings are affected by specific attributes of the ride experience of travelling in a fully-automated real-world, shared vehicle. To this end, 55 participants experienced riding in an SAV shuttle under experimental conditions at a test facility. Each experimental run involved two unrelated participants, accompanied by a safety operative and a researcher, undertaking four trips in the SAV, during which two conditions were presented for each of the independent variables of 'direction of face' (forwards/backwards) and 'maximum vehicle speed' (8/16 km/h). Order of presentation was varied between pairs of participants. After each run, participants rated the dependent variables 'trust' and 'comfort' (the latter variable comprised by six comfort factors). Expected and evaluative ratings were also obtained during pre-experimental orientation and debriefing sessions. Statistically significant relationships (p < .001) were found between trust and each of the independent variables, but for neither variable in the case of perceived comfort. A strong correlation was found between comfort and trust, interpreted as indicating trust in the SAV as an important predictor of perceived comfort. The before and after-experiment ratings for both variables showed statistically significant increases, and particularly for daily car drivers.

AB We model and analyze a futuristic intersection that serves only connected, autonomous andcentrally managed vehicles. Under consideration are three control strategies that aim tominimize the total system delay by choosing an optimal trajectory for each vehicle. The firsttwo abandon the concept of signal timing all together whereas the third strategy keeps it. Thedifference between the two signal-free strategies has to do with a fail-safe buffer requirementintroduced to provide redundancy. Each control strategy leads to a unique version of atrajectory-based autonomous intersection management (T-AIM) problem, which is formulatedas a mixed integer linear program and solved using both a commercial solver and a specializedheuristic algorithm. We find the signal-free strategy holds an overwhelming advantage over thesignal-based strategy in terms of efficiency. However, its success is fragile and dependent onthe faith in the safety and reliability of the system. When the fail-safe buffer is introduced,the efficiency of the signal-free strategy degrades to a level comparable to that of a properlyoptimized signal-based strategy. Surprisingly, the signal-free strategy with redundancy tends toarrange vehicles in groups that take turns to cross the intersection together. This ''signal-likebehavior" manifests itself whenever congestion rises to a certain threshold. In addition, solvingthe T-AIM problem based on signal timing enjoys significant computational benefits, because iteliminates many conflicts. Thus, the basic logic of signal timing - if not the physical equipment- may survive even after humans are no longer allowed to drive.

AB Lane-changing manoeuvres are essential for daily driving tasks. Safety and comfort are the primary issues to be considered during the lane-changing manoeuvres of autonomous vehicles. However, because the traffic environment is complicated and changeable, executing fixed lane-changing manoeuvres cannot guarantee safety and comfort. Thus, it is important to find a flexible method that can plan and re-plan a lane-changing path according to the traffic environment in real time. But that remains smooth to ensure the vehicle occupants stay comfortable. Therefore, this paper proposes a method for planning a flexible and smooth lane-changing path in real time. The proposed method uses the bi-elementary paths to ensure comfort, and clothoid and arc curves are superimposed on the bi-elementary paths to add re-planning flexibility. Additionally, lookup tables and reasonable approximations are employed to quickly generate and evaluate lane-changing paths. The results of the simulations demonstrate that the proposed method is able to plan and re-plan a smooth lane-changing path. Then, the results of vehicle experiments performed based on the embedded controller platform show that the proposed method guarantees real-time performance, that the planned path is easy to follow, and that the planned paths make autonomous vehicle lane-changing manoeuvres safe and comfortable.

AB By simultaneously utilizing preview and global road information, a comfort optimization strategy which combines vehicle speed planning and preview semi-active suspension control is designed for autonomous vehicles. Considering that the impact of vehicle speed at the suspension vibration source is always a barrier for preview suspension control, a processing method for the road data is novelly proposed. Then, to utilize the processed data and to handle the nonlinearity of semi-active actuators, a hybrid horizon-varying (HV) model predictive control (MPC) method is given. The method can adapt to speed variation and meanwhile take the most of the road data within a fixed preview length. Further, based on the global information and considering multiple road irregularities in a driving path, a speed planning problem is established in the spatial domain and a dynamic programming based solution is provided. The final speed trajectory can compromise the driving time, vertical vibration and longitudinal acceleration. Various simulation results have been employed to verify the superiority of the hybrid HV-MPC method and the significance of speed and suspension coordination for comfort improvement.

AB In this work the design, implementation and real-time tests of a navigation system for the autonomous surface vehicle MACaBOT is presented. This vehicle represents a versatile platform to perform several tasks in the marine environment, such as; ports maintenance, marine productive ecosystems studies and bathymetries. The navigation system is responsible for accurately determining the position, velocity and attitude of the vehicle. It represents a fundamental component to autonomously carry out any of the aforementioned tasks. In this work, the navigation system is developed based on a GPS aided strap-down inertial navigation system using an extended Kalman filter sensor fusion algorithm. In order to provide an adaptive approach to the sensor fusion algorithm tuning a fuzzy inference system is used. The navigation system was implemented as a package for the Robot Operating System, benefiting from the advantages of heterogeneity, integration and hardware abstraction. Real time tests of the MACaBOT on a local creek were carried out, showing satisfactory performance of the navigation system in both position and velocity estimates. In addition to these tests, simulations of GPS outages were carried out with the registered data to evaluate the performance of the navigation system in such cases

AB This paper presents a digital twin-driven fault diagnosis approach based on a graphical model and an adaptive extended Kalman filter algorithm for autonomous surface vehicles. In contrast with the traditional adaptive Kalman filter algorithm, where the fault parameters are treated as extended state variables, the newly proposed adaptive extended Kalman filter algorithm estimates the magnitude of the faults by calculating the parameter estimation gains directly from the sensor systems. To this end, the algorithm utilizes data from a global navigation satellite system receiver assuming the persistence of excitation conditions on the control inputs. The algorithm is tested in the Otter, an autonomous surface vehicle developed by Maritime Robotics, in which one of its propellers is faulty. Technically, the digital twin receives real-time data from the sensor system, estimates the magnitude of the actuator faults, and visualizes the results in a web-based application using JavaScript with Three.js library and Mapbox for real-world 3D map generation. Information regarding the magnitude of the faults is important for fault-tolerant control. Simulation and experimental results show the proposed approach is able to detect and estimate the actuator faults accurately.

AB In view of the paucity of hydrometeorological data, inefficiency and high cost of manual detection, a design scheme of meteorological monitoring unmanned surface vehicle (USV) based on STM32 MCU (Microcontroller Unit, which is also known as Single Chip Microcomputer) is proposed in this paper. The path planning is designed by combining the image data acquired by camera with improved RRT-path algorithm (rapidly-exploring random tree algorithm based on auxiliary path), and then motors are controlled so as to realize autonomous cruise control of USV using the incremental PID algorithm. In addition, the design can also realize real-time monitoring of meteorological data detected by meteorological sensors on the USV through upper computer. Compared with the traditional scheme, the path planning, autonomous cruise is as well as online monitoring function of the scheme presented below enable USVs have full autonomous capability to realize on-line monitoring of meteorological data.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to bring significant changes to the mobility of people, especially those with disabilities. Despite the strong potential of AVs to impact the lives of people with disabilities, little attention has been paid to understand their perspectives on this technology. This study aims to fill the gap, by exploring the mobility challenges experienced by people with disabilities and the overall perceptions of autonomous vehicle transportation (AVT) services among people with disabilities. The specific focus is on individuals with physical disabilities and individuals with visual impairments. This study used a three-phase exploratory sequential mixed-methods design. We began by conducting focus groups and analyzing the collected data. From the focus group results, we developed a survey instrument in the second phase. In the third phase, we collected and analyzed the survey data to verify the initial focus group findings. Additionally, the survey included stated preference choice experiments to assess the AV acceptance level of people with disabilities. The results revealed that people with disabilities' mobility issues with current public transit services and neighborhood built environments may influence their positive attitudes toward AVT services. Despite several concerns raised about AVs regarding accessibility, safety, and reliability, most participants showed a high acceptance level of AVT. The findings provide industry and policy-makers with insights into the expectations, concerns, and needs regarding AVT from the perspectives of people with disabilities.

AB When connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are widely used in the future, we can foresee many essential applications, such as platoon formation and autonomous police patrolling, which need two CAVs, initially separated in a mixed traffic flow involving CAVs and human-drive vehicles (HDVs), to quickly approach each other and then keep a stable car-following mode. The entire process should not jeopardize surrounding traffic safety and efficiency. The existing literature has not studied this CAV synchronization control well, and this study seeks to make up this gap partially. To do that, we developed a Model Predictive Control model embedded with a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP-MPC), which integrates micro- and macro-traffic flow models to capture hybrid traffic flow dynamics. Specifically, the MPC will generate control law at each discrete timestamp to manage the microscopic movements of the two subject CAVs while predicting their neighboring vehicles' movement by well-accepted car-following models and estimating the distant upstream traffic' response by the macroscopic traffic model such as cell transmission model (CTM). The MINLP-MPC is multi-objective, seeking to sustain both synchronization and traffic efficiencies. To generate such well-balanced optimal control, we noticed that the synchronization experiences two distinct phases, sequentially completing the catch-up and platooning tasks. Accordingly, we transferred MINLP-MPC to a hybrid MPC system consisting of two sequential MPCs, respectively prioritizing the catch-up and platooning control. Then, we developed a weighting strategy to tune the control priorities adaptively. The recursive feasibility of the MPC is mathematically proved. Furthermore, we generalized the MPC and the hybrid MPC system to enable multi-vehicle synchronization. A numerical study built upon the NGSIM dataset demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of our approaches under different congestion levels and CAV penetrations.

TI Evaluation Methodology of Leader-Follower Autonomous Vehicle System for

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Mobile and slow-moving operations, such as striping, sweeping, bridge flushing, and pothole patching, are critical for efficient and safe operation of a highway transportation system. However, reducing hazards for roadway workers and achieving a safer environment for both roadway maintenance operators and the public is a challenging problem. In 2017 alone, a total of 158,000 vehicle crashes occurred in work zones in the U.S.A., accounting for 61,000 injuries. The autonomous truck-mounted attenuator (ATMA) vehicle, sometimes referred to as an autonomous impact protection vehicle (AIPV), offers a promising solution to eliminate injuries to roadway maintenance workers and the public. This paper presents the evaluation methodology for the ATMA system, as well as the outcomes of field testing in Sedalia, Missouri. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first academic research to focus on ATMA. The ATMA system is first reviewed, followed by an introduction to the field testing procedures that includes descriptions of test cases and data collected, and their format. An analysis methodology is then proposed to quantitatively evaluate the system's performance, and statistical models and hypothesis testing procedures are developed and presented. The numerical analysis results from real-world field testing under a controlled environment are presented, and the ATMA system's performance is summarized. This paper can serve as a reference for transportation agencies that are interested in deploying similar technologies or for academic researchers to assess characteristics of autonomous vehicles and to apply knowledge gained in transportation modeling and simulation practices.

AB The development of autonomous vehicles has prompted an interest in exploring various techniques in navigation. One such technique is simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which enables a vehicle to comprehend its surroundings, build a map of the environment in real time, and locate itself within that map. Although traditional techniques have been used to perform SLAM for a long time, recent advancements have seen the incorporation of neural network techniques into various stages of the SLAM pipeline. This review article provides a focused analysis of the recent developments in neural network techniques for SLAM-based localization of autonomous ground vehicles. In contrast to the previous review studies that covered general navigation and SLAM techniques, this paper specifically addresses the unique challenges and opportunities presented by the integration of neural networks in this context. Existing review studies have highlighted the limitations of conventional visual SLAM, and this article aims to explore the potential of deep learning methods. This article discusses the functions required for localization, and several neural network-based techniques proposed by researchers to carry out such functions. First, it presents a general background of the issue, the relevant review studies that have already been done, and the adopted methodology in this review. Then, it provides a thorough review of the findings regarding localization and odometry. Finally, it presents our analysis of the findings, open research questions in the field, and a conclusion. A semisystematic approach is used to carry out the review.

AB This paper proposes a mixed-vehicles car-following model based on FVAD (Full Velocity and Acceleration Difference) model to describe the microscopic car-following behavior of RVs (Regular Vehicles) and AVs (Autonomous Vehicles). The model involves the velocity of multiple front vehicles and a rear vehicle as well as the velocity difference, acceleration difference and headway between each front vehicle and the host vehicle. As for AV's car-following model we introduced the molecular dynamic theory to quantitatively express the influence of multiple front vehicles on the host vehicle. The velocity of multiple front vehicles and headway between each of them and the host vehicle are used to express the influence. Besides, we consider drivers' car-following styles in constructing the RV model. The stability analysis results indicate that the stability of traffic flow under the proposed model is not easily affected by the change in velocity, and is better than FVAD model. According to the data collected from the car-following field test mixed with AVs and RVs, we obtain the optimal value of the parameters in the model, and examine the fitting accuracy with a numerical simulation. The results indicate that compared with FVAD model, the MME (Mean Maximum Error) and ME (Mean Error) of RV model is reduced by 39.50% and 13.12%, respectively, and the accuracy is improved by 14.48%. The acceleration strategy controlled by the AV model is smoother than by the ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control) model. With effective car-following behavior control, it is helpful to improve the operation efficiency of AVs and enhance the stability of traffic flow. Additionally, the model can be utilized for platoon control in the case of RVs' and AVs' heterogeneous flow. This model can also serve as a tool to simulate car-following behavior, which is beneficial for road traffic management and infrastructure layout in AV and RV mixed traffic environment.

AB For autonomous vehicles, face-based authentication is one of the best ways to identify or verify a user. Deep learning methods, such as Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN), have brought excellent accuracy in recent years. However, building an optimal DCNN and ameliorating face-based authentication performance are still the main challenges for autonomous vehicles. From these challenges, we first investigate and analyze the effect of several novel effective loss functions on DCNN, such as CosFace, ArcFace, and MagFace, for face-based authentication. We then propose a parallel ensemble learning, namely PelFace, by taking advantage of recent models based on CosFace, ArcFace, and MagFace. PelFace elaborates on the voting mechanism that utilizes non-optimal pre-trained models to obtain better discriminative ability for face-based authentication. In addition, we propose to perform the matching phase for each PelFace model in parallel. To prove the performance of both the speed and accuracy of PelFace, we carry out rigorous experiments using several popular benchmarks, including LFW, CFP-FP, and AgeDB-30, as well as two renovations of LFW: CALFW and CPLFW. The results of our experiments achieve state-of-the-art figures, which show the proposed method's massive potential in improving face-based authentication performance. Ablation studies and overall benchmarks significantly confirm the effectiveness of our PelFace.

AB Underwater imaging has been present for many decades due to its relevance in vision and navigation systems. In recent years, advances in robotics have led to the availability of autonomous or unmanned underwater vehicles (AUVs, UUVs). Despite the rapid development of new studies and promising algorithms in this field, there is currently a lack of research toward standardized, general-approach proposals. This issue has been stated in the literature as a limiting factor to be addressed in the future. The key starting point of this work is to identify a synergistic effect between professional photography and scientific fields by analyzing image acquisition issues. Subsequently, we discuss underwater image enhancement and quality assessment, image mosaicking and algorithmic concerns as the last processing step. In this line, statistics about 120 AUV articles fro recent decades have been analyzed, with a special focus on state-of-the-art papers from recent years. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to identify critical issues in autonomous underwater vehicles encompassing the entire process, starting from optical issues in image sensing and ending with some issues related to algorithmic processing. In addition, a global underwater workflow is proposed, extracting future requirements, outcome effects and new perspectives in this context.

AB A sustainable transportation future is one in which people eschew personal car ownership in favor of using autonomous vehicle (AV)-based ridehailing services in a shared mode. However, the traveling public has historically shown a disinclination toward sharing rides and carpooling with strangers. In a future of AV-based ridehailing services, it will be necessary for people to embrace both AVs as well as true ridesharing to fully realize the benefits of automated and shared mobility technologies. This study investigated the factors influencing willingness to use AV-based ridehailing services in the future in a shared mode (i.e., with strangers). This was done through the estimation of a behavioral model system on a comprehensive survey data set that included rich information about attitudes, perceptions, and preferences pertaining to the adoption of AVs and shared mobility modes. The model results showed that current ridehailing experiences strongly influenced the likelihood of being willing to ride AV-based services in a shared mode. Campaigns that provide opportunities for individuals to experience such services firsthand would potentially go a long way to enabling a shared mobility future at scale. In addition, several attitudinal variables were found to strongly influence the adoption of future mobility services; these findings provide insights on the likely early adopters of shared autonomous mobility services and the types of educational awareness campaigns that may effect change in the prospects of such services.

AB The application of autonomous agricultural vehicles is gaining popularity as a way to increase production efficiency and lower operational costs. To achieve high performance, perception tasks (such as obstacle detection, road extraction, and drivable area extraction) are of great importance. Compared with structured roads, field roads between farmlands, including unstructured roads and semi-structured roads, are unfavorable for autonomous agricultural vehicle driving due to their bumpiness and unstructured nature. This study proposed an extraction method for the straight field roads between farmlands. The proposed method was based on the point cloud data acquired by LiDAR (Velodyne VLP-16) mounted on a John Deere 1204 6B-1204 tractor. The proposed method has three aspects: Euclidean Clustering-based extraction, boundary-based extraction, and road point cloud curve segment modification. Firstly, Euclidean Clustering with K-Dimensional (KD)-Tree data structure was adopted to extract the road curve segments close to the LiDAR composed of road points. Secondly, the boundary lines constraint was constructed to extract the distant road curve segments. Thirdly, the local distance ratio was used to modify the extracted road curve segments. The average extraction accuracy for both semi-structured and unstructured roads exceeded 98%, and the false positive rate (FPR) was less than 0.5%. These experimental findings demonstrated that the proposed road extraction method was precise and effective. The proposed method of this study can be applied to enhance the perception ability of autonomous agricultural vehicles thereby increasing the efficiency and safety of field road driving.

AB This paper proposes a fractional-order sliding mode control method for an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with random disturbances. First, a new fractional-order sliding mode disturbance observer (FOSMDO) is designed to estimate the random disturbance and unknown AUV's model based on adaptive and fixed time. A strategy based on adaptive fractional sliding mode control is designed for motion control, and a line-of-sight guidance law with time-varying look-ahead distance is applied to achieve path following. Then, a new fractional-order sliding model controller is designed by constructing a fractional-order mode surface and proposing a prescribed performance function to ensure the control performance. The closed-loop stability is proved and analyzed, and the effectiveness and robustness of the controller are demonstrated by numeric simulations.

AB A new unified motion planning algorithm for autonomous Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator Systems (UVMS) has been presented in this paper. Commonly, a UVMS consists of two sub-systems, a vehicle and a manipulator, having vastly different dynamic responses. The proposed algorithm considers the variability in dynamic bandwidth of the complex UVMS system and generates not only kinematically admissible but also dynamically feasible reference trajectories. Additionally, this motion planning algorithm exploits the inherent kinematic redundancy of the whole system and provides reference trajectories that accommodates other important criteria such as thruster/actuator faults and saturations, and also minimizes hydrodynamic drag. Effectiveness of the proposed unified motion planning algorithm has been verified by extensive computer simulation. The results are quite promising.

AB A new motion coordination algorithm for an autonomous underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) is proposed. This algorithm generates the desired trajectories for both the vehicle and the manipulator in such a way that the total hydrodynamic drag on the system is minimized. Resolution of kinematic redundancy of the system is performed at the acceleration level so that this algorithm can be incorporated into the system dynamics. The dynamics of the UVMS are modeled using a quasi-Lagrange approach. A state-space formulation of the system along with a model-based controller design for trajectory-following tasks that includes thruster dynamics is also presented, The computer simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed method in reducing the drag on the system.

AB As the private sector is under heavy pressure to serve the ever-growing e-commerce market, the potential of implementing new disruptive mobility/logistics services for increasing the level of the current last-mile delivery (LMD) services, is emerging. Vehicle automation technology, characterized by high-capacity utilization and asset intensity, appears to be a prominent response to easing this pressure, while contributing to mitigation of the adverse effects associated with the deployment of LMD activities. This research studied the perceptions of Greek end-users/consumers, regarding the introduction of autonomous/automated/driverless vehicles (AVs) in innovative delivery services. To achieve this, a mixed logit model was developed, based on a Stated Preferences (SP) experiment, designed to capture the demand of alternative last-mile delivery modes/services, such as drones, pods, and autonomous vans, compared to traditional delivery services. The results show that the traditional delivery, i.e., having a dedicated delivery person who picks up the parcels at a consolidation point and delivers them directly to the recipients while driving a non-autonomous vehicle-conventional van, bike, e-bike, e-scooter-remains the most acceptable delivery method. Moreover, the analysis indicated that there is no interest yet in deploying home deliveries with drones or AVs, and that participants are unwilling to pay extra charges for having access to more advanced last-mile delivery modes/services. Thus, it is important to promote the benefits of innovative modes and services for LMD, in order to increase public awareness and receptivity in Greece.

AB This paper is concerned with the problem of coordinated path-following for networked underactuated autonomous surface vehicles in the presence of time-varying state-dependent cyber-attack. An adaptive bounded neural network controller is proposed to mitigate the malicious effect of the cyber-attack. At first, an individual path-following control law is designed for each vehicle by fusing a back-stepping technique, a line-of-sight guidance principle and a predictor-based neural network method. Second, a path update law is developed based on a synchronization approach together with an adaptive control method. The salient features of the proposed controller are presented as follows. First, an adaptive corrective signal is incorporated into the path update law design such that a desired formation can be achieved regardless of the time-varying state-dependent cyber-attack. Second, by using a saturation function and a projection operator, the proposed controller is bounded and the bound is known as a priori. It is proven that the closed-loop system is input-to-state practical stable in the face of time-varying state-dependent cyber-attack. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive bounded neural network controller for coordinated path-following of networked underactuated autonomous surface vehicles subject to the cyber-attack.

AB Autonomous vehicles are complex systems that are challenging to test and debug. A requirements-driven approach to the development process can decrease the resources required to design and test these systems, while simultaneously increasing the reliability. We present a testing framework that uses signal temporal logic (STL), which is a precise and unambiguous requirements language. Our framework evaluates test cases against the STL formulae and additionally uses the requirements to automatically identify test cases that fail to satisfy the requirements. One of the key features of our tool is the support for machine learning (ML) components in the system design, such as deep neural networks. The framework allows evaluation of the control algorithms, including the ML components, and it also includes models of CCD camera, lidar, and radar sensors, as well as the vehicle environment. We use multiple methods to generate test cases, including covering arrays, which is an efficient method to search discrete variable spaces. The resulting test cases can be used to debug the controller design by identifying controller behaviors that do not satisfy requirements. The test cases can also enhance the testing phase of development by identifying critical corner cases that correspond to the limits of the system's allowed behaviors. We present STL requirements for an autonomous vehicle system, which capture both component-level and system-level behaviors. Additionally, we present three driving scenarios and demonstrate how our requirements-driven testing framework can be used to identify critical system behaviors, which can be used to support the development process.

ID ROBOT NAVIGATION
AB An autonomous vehicle operating alongside humans should ideally have a high social capability, such as being able to communicate with humans, negotiate space, predict reactions, etc. This can be achieved by a prediction feature trained with diverse data on human behavior. Hierarchical cyber-physical system (CPS) architecture design, which sends the prediction feature to an external server while observing a limited operational design domain (ODD) and acquiring data continuously, has great potential to refine the training process as well as improve the performance. However, this architecture design requires the planning and prediction modules to be explicitly decoupled, which takes away from the recent success on social navigation. In this paper, we propose a novel autonomous navigation framework enabling social behavior while decoupling the planning and prediction modules to take advantage of the hierarchical CPS architecture. In the proposed framework, pedestrian trajectories are predicted as reactions to pre-generated candidates for an ego vehicle trajectory, and the ego vehicle trajectory is then selected to maximize mutual benefit to both the ego vehicle and surrounding pedestrians. We evaluated the proposed framework with simulations using the social force model and found that it was able to achieve the social behavior.

AB This paper presents a novel learning-based cruise controller for autonomous land vehicles (ALVs) with unknown dynamics and external disturbances. The learning controller consists of a time-varying proportional-integral (PI) module and an actor-critic learning control module with kernel machines. The learning objective for the cruise control is to make the vehicle's longitudinal velocity follow a smoothed spline-based speed profile with the smallest possible errors. The parameters in the PI module are adaptively tuned based on the vehicle's state and the action policy of the learning control module. Based on the state transition data of the vehicle controlled by various initial policies, the action policy of the learning control module is optimized by kernel-based least squares policy iteration (KLSPI) in an offline way. The effectiveness of the proposed controller was tested on an ALV platform during long-distance driving in urban traffic and autonomous driving on off-road terrain. The experimental results of the cruise control show that the learning control method can realize data-driven controller design and optimization based on KLSPI and that the controller's performance is adaptive to different road conditions.

AB The Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) is an emerging mobility technology that may hold a paradigm changing potential for the future of transport policy and planning. Despite a wealth of likely benefits that have made their eventual launch inescapable, CAVs may also be a source of unprecedented disruption for tomorrow's travel eco-systems because of their vulnerability to cyber-threats, hacking and misinformation. CAVs manipulated by users, traffic controllers or third parties may act in deceitful ways. This scene-setting work introduces the deceitful CAV, a vehicle that operates in a deceitful manner towards routing and control functionality for 'selfish' or malicious purposes and contextualises its diverse expressions and dimensions. It specifically offers a systematic taxonomy of eight distinctive deceitful behaviours namely: suppression/camouflage, overloading, mistake, substitution, target conditioning, repackaging capability signatures, amplification and reinforcing impression. These as exemplified by their most common attack forms (i.e., starvation, denial-of-service, session hijacking, man-in-the-middle, poisoning, masquerading, flooding and spoofing) are then benchmarked against five key dimensions referring to time frame (short to long duration), engagement (localised to systemic), urban traffic controller infrastructure (single to multiple components), scale (low to high), and impact (low to high). We then suggest mitigation strategies to protect CAV technology against these dangers. These span from purely technological measures referring to the machine-centric triad of vehicles, communication, and control system including adversarial training, heuristic decision algorithms and weighted voting mechanisms to human factor measures that focus on education, training, awareness enhancement, licensing and legislation initiatives that will enable users and controllers to prevent, control or report deceitful activities.

AB The advancement of technologies has fast-tracked the deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs), however, they necessitate the modernization of the existing road infrastructure to meet the technical and safety requirements of AVs. Due to the high cost and prolonged time required for upgrading infrastructure, it is expected that AVs will be introduced gradually into the existing transport network of human-driven vehicles (HVs) either jointly or separately in a special area or zone within that network. In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework for modelling and deployment of multi-lane AV zone in a mixed-user traffic network that takes into account the different route choice decisions of HVs and AVs. The model is used to study two different designs for a multi-lane AV zone, where in Design 1, both lanes are dedicated for AVs inside the AV zone; while in Design 2, one lane is dedicated for AVs, and another lane is for the HV traffic. We then derive an equivalent convex formulation and develop a novel solution method for this complex problem, as well as evaluate and compare the performance of the designs in a realistic large-scale transportation network. Numerical results show that the deployment of a multi-lane AV zone improves network performance in terms of the total system travel time (TSTT). The proposed framework can be used to assist transportation planners and decision-makers to successfully deploy AVs seamlessly with mixed traffic.

AB The rapid development of 6G can help to bring autonomous driving closed to the reality. Drivers and passengers will have more time for work and leisure spending in the vehicles, further generating a lot of data requirements. However, edge resources from small base stations are insufficient to match the wide variety of services of the future vehicular networks. Besides, due to the high-speed nature of the vehicles, users have to switch the connections among different base stations, whereas such way will cause external latency during the data request. Therefore, it is vital to enable the local cache of vehicle users to realize the reliable autonomous driving. In this paper, we consider caching the contents in the local cache, small base station, and edge server. In practice, the request preference of some single users may he different from a whole region. To maximize the efficiency of content cache, we design a strategy that uses reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize cache schemes on different devices. The experimental results demonstrate that our strategy can enhance the cache hit ratio by 10%-20% compared with the well-known counterparts.

AB It is expected that most accidents occurring due to human mistakes will be eliminated by autonomous vehicles. Their control is based on real-time data obtained from the various sensors, processed by sophisticated algorithms and the operation of actuators. However, it is worth noting that this process flow cannot handle unexpected accident situations like a child running out in front of the vehicle or an unexpectedly slippery road surface. A comprehensive analysis of historical accident data can help to forecast these situations. For example, it is possible to localize areas of the public road network, where the number of accidents related to careless pedestrians or bad road surface conditions is significantly higher than expected. This information can help the control of the autonomous vehicle to prepare for dangerous situations long before the real-time sensors provide any related information. This manuscript presents a data-mining method working on the already existing road accident database records to find the black spots of the road network. As a next step, a further statistical approach is used to find the significant risk factors of these zones, which result can be built into the controlling strategy of self-driven cars to prepare them for these situations to decrease the probability of the potential further incidents. The evaluation part of this paper shows that the robustness of the proposed method is similar to the already existing black spot searching algorithms. However, it provides additional information about the main accident patterns.

In order to increase the accuracy of vehicle detection and tracking, a new clustering algorithm is proposed to obtain vehicle candidates from preprocessed point cloud data collected by the LiDAR. A classifier trained by the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is used to detect vehicles from vehicle candidates. Kalman filter and global nearest neighbor (GNN) algorithm are used to track vehicles, and the accuracy of vehicle detection result is further improved by the aid of tracking results. The proposed method has been verified on a testing platform.

ID CARRIER-PHASE
AB Autonomous vehicles equipped with integrity augmentation systems offer the potential to increase safety, efficiency and sustainability of airport ground operations. The model predictive behavior of these systems supports a timely detection of any deviations from the Required Navigation Performance (RNP), producing useful alerts for onboard mission management. Firstly, the system architecture of a Navigation and Guidance System (NGS) for autonomous airport surface vehicle operations based on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements is described. Subsequently, an integrity augmentation module is implemented in the NGS by modeling the key GNSS signal degradation phenomena including masking, multipath and signal attenuation. The GNSS integrity augmentation system is capable of monitoring the RNP and alerting the remote operator of the airport surface vehicle. The uniqueness of the presented system is that both caution and warning flags are produced based on prediction-avoidance and reaction-correction capabilities respectively. Additionally, the system is capable of issuing suitable steering commands to the onboard mission management system/remote ground base station operator in the event of GNSS signal degradations or losses. Multipath is modelled in detail using a ray tracing algorithm and the vehicle position error is computed as a function of relative geometry between the satellites, receiver antenna and reflectors in realistic airport operation scenarios. Additionally, the surface vehicle dynamics and reflective surfaces of buildings are modelled in order to simulate a vehicle trajectory through a typical airport airside/aprons environment. Simulation case studies are performed to validate the mathematical models developed for the integrity augmentation system and the results corroborate the suitability of the proposed system to generate useful and timely integrity flags when GNSS is used as the primary means of navigation.

ID STABILITY ANALYSIS; DYNAMICS; PLANE
AB The typical method of vehicle steering bifurcation analysis is based on the nonlinear autonomous vehicle model deriving from the classic two degrees of freedom(2DOF) linear vehicle model. This method usually neglects the driving effect on steering bifurcation characteristics. However, in the steering and driving combined conditions, the tyre under different driving conditions can provide different lateral force. The steering bifurcation mechanism without the driving effect is not able to fully reveal the vehicle steering and driving bifurcation characteristics. Aiming at the aforementioned problem, this paper analyzed the vehicle steering and driving bifurcation characteristics with the consideration of driving effect. Based on the 5DOF vehicle system dynamics model with the consideration of driving effect, the 7DOF autonomous system model was established. The vehicle steering and driving bifurcation dynamic characteristics were analyzed with different driving mode and driving torque. Taking the front-wheel-drive system as an example, the dynamic evolution process of steering and driving bifurcation was analyzed by phase space, system state variables, power spectral density, and Lyapunov index. The numerical recognition results of chaos were also provided. The research results show that the driving mode and driving torque have the obvious effect on steering and driving bifurcation characteristics.

AB This article presents a collision avoidance system for multiple robots based on the current autonomous car collision avoidance system. The purpose of the system is to improve the current autonomous car collision avoidance system by including data input of other vehicles' velocity and positioning via vehicle-to-vehicle communication into the current autonomous car collision avoidance system. There are two TurtleBots used in experimental testing. TurtleBot is used as the robot agent while Google Lightweight Communication and Marshalling is used for inter-robot communication. Additionally, Gazebo software is used to run the simulation. There are two types of collision avoidance system algorithm (collision avoidance system without inter-robot communication and collision avoidance system with inter-robot communication) that are developed and tested in two main road crash scenarios, rear end collision scenario and junction crossing intersection collision scenario. Both algorithms are tested and run both in simulation and experiment setup, each with 10 repetitions for Lead TurtleBot sudden stop, Lead TurtleBot decelerate, Lead TurtleBot slower speed, and straight crossing path conditions. Simulation and experimental results data for each algorithm are recorded and tabulated. A comprehensive comparison of performance between the proposed algorithms is analyzed. The results showed that the proposed system is able to prevent collision between vehicles with an acceptable success rate.

   magnetic data; Heading correction; Magnetic interference
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are advanced near-bottom platforms that can be used for magnetometric analysis of the seafloor. However, the vehicle itself can cause interference with the magnetic measurements, which need to be corrected. Here, we derive a functional relation between the magnetic measurements and AUV's heading that is based on the composition and causes of an AUV's near-bottom magnetic anomaly. We set up a method to correct tri-axial magnetometer interference caused by the AUV. Magnetic induction intensity is removed using magnetic data collected during the spinning of the AUV. Connatural magnetic field of the AUV is collected and subtracted by using portable magnetometer. The method performs very well during QianlongII AUV experimental tests performed on land and in lake. The method also corrects magnetic data by an autonomous benthic explorer (ABE) AUV and yields good results. The effects of main components of QianlongII AUV on the magnetic measurement results are analyzed and make sure dominating interference produced by the batteries. That is mitigated using a probe extension pole. Furthermore, excellent survey data and satisfactory correction results are obtained during the AUV sea trials. This verifies the efficacy of the proposed method for correcting triaxial magnetometer interference caused by AUV.

AB 5G MillimeterWave (mmWave) technology holds great promise for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) due to its ability to achieve data rates in the Gbps range. However, mmWave suffers from a high beamforming overhead and requirement of line of sight (LOS) to maintain a strong connection. For Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) scenarios, where CAVs connect to roadside units (RSUs), these drawbacks become apparent. Because vehicles are dynamic, there is a large potential for link blockages. These blockages are detrimental to the connected applications running on the vehicle, such as cooperative perception and remote driver takeover. Existing RSU selection schemes base their decisions on signal strength and vehicle trajectory alone, which is not enough to prevent the blockage of links. Many modern CAVs motion planning algorithms routinely use other vehicle's near-future path plans, either by explicit communication among vehicles, or by prediction. In this paper, we make use of the knowledge of other vehicle's near future path plans to further improve the RSU association mechanism for CAVs. We solve the RSU association algorithm by converting it to a shortest path problem with the objective to maximize the total communication bandwidth. We evaluate our approach, titled B-AWARE, in simulation using Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) and Digital twin for self-dRiving Intelligent VEhicles (DRIVE) on 12 highway and city street scenarios with varying traffic density and RSU placements. Simulations show B-AWARE results in a 1.05x improvement of the potential datarate in the average case and 1.28x in the best case vs. the state-of-the-art. But more impressively, B-AWARE reduces the time spent with no connection by 42% in the average case and 60% in the best case as compared to the state-of-the-art methods. This is a result of B-AWARE reducing nearly 100% of blockage occurrences.

AB Car-following is a common driving behavior which has a significant effect on driver safety and comfort. Although a large number of studies have focused on car-following models for autonomous vehicles (AV) and connected vehicles (CV), car-following models for AV and CV which consider cut-ins in mixed traffic have not been investigated. In this study, a human-like car-following model for AV and CV was developed by examining the effect of cut-in vehicles on car-following behavior and the expectations of drivers. The cut-in position, reaction time, acceleration, and desired distance were investigated on a real freeway in an instrumented vehicle. Corresponding to results from previous studies, the cut-in vehicles maintain a safe distance from the preceding vehicle and a larger distance from the following vehicle to avoid conflict. Analysis of the behavior of the following driver illustrates that in the keeping stages, the reaction time after the cut-in is 0.85 s for the acceleration stimulus and 0.70 s for the deceleration stimulus. These times are shorter than the response time before the cutin for the acceleration (1.95 s) and deceleration stimuli (1.66 s). The acceleration, rate of increase in the acceleration with the relative speed, and the desired distance are lower after than before the cut-in events. In this paper, a human-like car-following model for cut-in situations is proposed, which is designed for autonomous vehicles. Unlike previous car-following models, the proposed model has a shorter response time and lower deceleration in cut-in situations. The proposed model may help to improve car-following safety, driver comfort, and trust in AVs and CVs.

AB In this paper, a dynamic spectrum management framework is proposed to improve spectrum resource utilization in a multi-access edge computing (MEC) in autonomous vehicular network (AVNET). To support the increasing communication data traffic and guarantee quality-of-service (QoS), spectrum slicing, spectrum allocating, and transmit power controlling are jointly considered. Accordingly, three non-convex network utility maximization problems are formulated to slice spectrum among base stations (BSs), allocate spectrum among autonomous vehicles (AVs) associated with a BS, and control transmit powers of BSs, respectively. Through linear programming relaxation and first-order Taylor series approximation, these problems are transformed into tractable forms and then are jointly solved through an alternate concave search (ACS) algorithm. As a result, the optimal spectrum slicing ratios among BSs, optimal BS-vehicle association patterns, optimal fractions of spectrum resources allocated to AVs, and optimal transmit powers of BSs are obtained. Based on our simulation, a high aggregate network utility is achieved by the proposed spectrum management scheme compared with two existing schemes.

AB Autonomous vehicles use sensing and communication technologies to navigate safely and efficiently with little or no input from the driver. These driverless technologies will create an unprecedented revolution in how people move, and policymakers will need appropriate tools to plan for and analyze the large impacts of novel navigation systems. In this paper we derive semiparametric estimates of the willingness to pay for automation. We use data from a nationwide online panel of 1260 individuals who answered a vehicle-purchase discrete choice experiment focused on energy efficiency and autonomous features. Several models were estimated with the choice microdata, including a conditional logit with deterministic consumer heterogeneity, a parametric random parameter logit, and a semiparametric random parameter logit. We draw three key results from our analysis. First, we find that the average household is willing to pay a significant amount for automation: about $3500 for partial automation and $4900 for full automation. Second, we estimate substantial heterogeneity in preferences for automation, where a significant share of the sample is willing to pay above $10,000 for full automation technology while many are not willing to pay any positive amount for the technology. Third, our semiparametric random parameter logit estimates suggest that the demand for automation is split approximately evenly between high, modest and no demand, highlighting the importance of modeling flexible preferences for emerging vehicle technology.

AB Rank particle filtering was applied to fault diagnosis technology. Control force and yaw moment losses that occurred in the corresponding degrees of freedom were estimated, and the trends of change were calculated by the multi-step-ahead prediction process in the rank particle filter. Based on the estimated results in the normal state, the situations involving failure were detected. To achieve this target, a mathematical model of the normal and faulty motion states of an underwater vehicle was first developed. Subsequently, the rank sample method combined with the particle filter was used, to obtain the importance probability density function of the autonomous underwater vehicle status. The rank particle filter obtained above realized the real-time state estimation and trend prediction of the motion state. A modified Bayesian algorithm was used to process the estimated control force and yaw moment losses in a given length of time. Based on the calculation results in the normal situations, a back propagation neural network was trained to obtain the diagnostic values. The condition of the propellers was determined based on the diagnostic values. Fault diagnosis simulation experiments were carried out using both the data obtained from the semi-physical simulation system with a hypothetical propeller failure, and the real sea trail data to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results showed that the rank particle filter method could be applied to the propeller fault diagnosis of autonomous underwater vehicles, and solved the problem that arises when a single degree of freedom of the loss is utilized.

AB Driving Decision-making Mechanism (DDM) is identified as the key technology to ensure the driving safety of autonomous vehicle, which is mainly influenced by vehicle states and road conditions. However, previous studies have seldom considered road conditions and their coupled effects on driving decisions. Therefore, road conditions are introduced into DDM in this paper, and are based on a Support Vector Machine Regression (SVR) model, which is optimized by a weighted hybrid kernel function and a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, this study designs a DDM for autonomous vehicle. Then, the SVR model with RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel function and BP (Back Propagation) neural network model are tested to validate the accuracy of the optimized SVR model. The results show that the optimized SVR model has the best performance than other two models. Finally, the effects of road conditions on driving decisions are analyzed quantitatively by comparing the reasoning results of DDM with different reference index combinations, and by the sensitivity analysis of DDM with added road conditions. The results demonstrate the significant improvement in the performance of DDM with added road conditions. It also shows that road conditions have the greatest influence on driving decisions at low traffic density, among those, the most influential is road visibility, then followed by adhesion coefficient, road curvature and road slope, while at high traffic density, they have almost no influence on driving decisions.

AB This paper presents an integrated path planning and tracking control framework for a marine current turbine (MCT), where the MCT is treated as an energy-harvesting autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Considering the ocean (space of action) is continuous, the proposed framework employs two modules to address path planning and path tracking enabled by the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, which is a policy gradient deep reinforcement learning (RL) method. To enable fully autonomous operation in a stochastic oceanic environment, the proposed path planning seeks a primary objective of maximizing the harvested energy; then, the path tracking module is designed to minimize the tracking error and avoid collisions with static and dynamic obstacles. Using field-collected acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) data, the performance of the proposed framework is evaluated. Comparative studies with baseline algorithms in three different scenarios of path planning, path tracking without an obstacle, and path tracking with collision avoidance verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

AB Achieving a critical mass in the acceptance of fully autonomous public transport (APT) is crucial for a society to effectively realise APT's intended environmental, social and economic benefits. The current study analyses the determinants contributing to user acceptance of APT through three theoretical lenses, namely, Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), Perceived Value Theory and Social Exchange Theory. Survey data were collected from 476 commuters in Beijing, China. The results reveal that the five dimensions of UTAUT (i.e. performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions and hedonic motivation) have positive influence on users' value perception of APT. Consequently, users' value perception of APT exerts both direct and indirect influences on users' acceptance of APT via trust. A key contribution of this study is the combination and synthesis of several complementary behavioural theories to explain user acceptance of autonomous vehicles. In addition, the results offer important implications for transport policymakers and operators, in particular, pertaining to areas on resource allocation, marketing, communication and education to improve user acceptance of APT.

AB This paper addresses the problem of fault detection, isolation, and adaptation (FDIA) in navigation systems on board passenger vehicles. The aim is to prevent malfunctions in systems such as advanced driving assistance systems and autonomous driving functions that use data provided by the navigation system. The integrity of the estimation of the vehicle position provided by the navigation system is continuously monitored and assessed. The proposed approach uses an additional estimate of vehicle position that is independent of the navigation system and based on data from standard vehicle sensors. First, fault detection consists in comparing the two estimates using a sequential statistical test to detect discrepancies despite the presence of noise. Second, fault isolation and adaptation is introduced to identify faulty estimates and to provide a correction where necessary. The FDIA framework presented here utilizes repeated trips along the same roads as a source of redundancy. Relevant properties of this formalism are given and verified experimentally using an equipped vehicle in rural and urban conditions and with various map faults. Results show that sequential FDIA performed well, even in difficult GNSS conditions.

AB This study demonstrates an autonomous formation flight of multiple flapping-wing flying vehicles for the first time. In order to extract the position and attitude information of each flying vehicle, an external motion capture system is applied. A path-following controller is designed so that each flapping-wing flying vehicle has a time-independent circular path with the predetermined radius, and the constant forward flight speed and altitude. Due to the variations in flight characteristics among four different flapping-wing flying vehicles, the gain of the directional control, which generates nonlinear rolling moment using the changes of the tension in flexible membrane wings, is individually tuned for each vehicle. The rotational speed of the circular path is kept constant by controlling the desired radius rather than the forward flight speed so that the formation angles between two closest flapping-wing flying vehicles are maintained at 90 degrees. The performances of the individual path-following controllers and the circular formation controller are statistically evaluated in terms of the mean and standard deviation of the flight state variables.

AB Online multi-object tracking (MOT) is extremely important for high-level spatial reasoning and path planning for autonomous and highly-automated vehicles. In this paper, we present a modular framework for tracking multiple objects (vehicles), capable of accepting object proposals fromdifferent sensor modalities (vision and range) and a variable number of sensors, to produce continuous object tracks. This work is a generalization of the MDP framework for MOT proposed by Xiang et al., with some key extensions - First, we track objects across multiple cameras and across different sensor modalities. This is done by fusing object proposals across sensors accurately and efficiently. Second, the objects of interest (targets) are tracked directly in the real world. This is a departure from traditional techniques where objects are simply tracked in the image plane. Doing so allows the tracks to be readily used by an autonomous agent for navigation and related tasks. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we test it on real world highway data collected from a heavily sensorized testbed capable of capturing full-surround information. We demonstrate that our framework is well-suited to track objects through entire maneuvers around the ego-vehicle, some of which take more than a few minutes to complete. We also leverage the modularity of our approach by comparing the effects of including/excluding different sensors, changing the total number of sensors, and the quality of object proposals on the final tracking result.

AB As autonomous vehicles become more common on the roads, their advancement draws on safety concerns for vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists. This paper presents a review of recent developments in pedestrian and cyclist detection and intent estimation to increase the safety of autonomous vehicles, for both the driver and other road users. Understanding the intentions of the pedestrian/cyclist enables the self-driving vehicle to take actions to avoid incidents. To make this possible, development of methods/techniques, such as deep learning (DL), for the autonomous vehicle will be explored. For example, the development of pedestrian detection has been significantly advanced using DL approaches, such as; Fast Region-Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) , Faster R-CNN and Single Shot Detector (SSD). Although DL has been around for several decades, the hardware to realise the techniques have only recently become viable. Using these DL methods for pedestrian and cyclist detection and applying it for the tracking, motion modelling and pose estimation can allow for a successful and accurate method of intent estimation for the vulnerable road users. Although there has been a growth in research surrounding the study of pedestrian detection using vision-based approaches, further attention should include focus on cyclist detection. To further improve safety for these vulnerable road users (VRUs), approaches such as sensor fusion and intent estimation should be investigated.

AB With recent advances in learning algorithms and hardware development, autonomous cars have shown promise when operating in structured environments under good driving conditions. However, for complex, cluttered, and unseen environments with high uncertainty, autonomous driving systems still frequently demonstrate erroneous or unexpected behaviors that could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Autonomous vehicles should ideally adapt to driving conditions; while this can be achieved through multiple routes, it would be beneficial as a first step to be able to characterize driveability in some quantified form. To this end, this paper aims to create a framework for investigating different factors that can impact driveability. Also, one of the main mechanisms to adapt autonomous driving systems to any driving condition is to be able to learn and generalize from representative scenarios. The machine learning algorithms that currently do so learn predominantly in a supervised manner and consequently need sufficient data for robust and efficient learning. Therefore, we also perform a comparative overview of 54 public driving datasets that enable learning and publish this dataset index at https://sites.google.com/view/driveability-survey-datasets. Specifically, we categorize the datasets according to the use cases and highlight the datasets that capture the complicated and hazardous driving conditions, which can be better used for training robust driving models. Furthermore, by discussions of what driving scenarios are not covered by the existing public datasets and what driveability factors need more investigation and data acquisition, this paper aims to encourage both targeted dataset collection and the proposal of novel driveability metrics that enhance the robustness of autonomous cars in adverse environments.

ID TRACKING CONTROL
AB This work aims to develop a robust model predictive control (MPC) based on the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) approach by using a discrete extended disturbance observer (ESO). The proposed technique uses the ADRC approach to lump disturbances and uncertainties into a total disturbance, which is estimated with a discrete ESO and rejected through feedback control. Thus, the effects of the disturbances are attenuated, and a model predictive control is designed based on a canonical model free of uncertainties and disturbances. The proposed control technique is tested through simulation into a robotic autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The AUV's dynamic model is used to compare the performance of a classical MPC and the combined MPC-ADRC. The evaluation results show evidence of the superiority of the MPC-ADRC over the classical MPC under tests of reference tracking, external disturbances rejection, and model uncertainties attenuation.

AB Car sharing services with Semi-Autonomous Electric Vehicles (SAEVs) represent an emerging transportation scheme which may comprise an important link in the green mobility chain for smart city operations. The main goal of the present paper is to introduce and develop an intelligent management system for the efficient relocation of SAEVs within the urban car-sharing context. A novel relocation strategy is analyzed regarding the upcoming technology of platooning. Considering real urban road networks for SAEVs, routing decisions are assessed based on the traffic conditions and energy efficiency. Fuzzy logic concepts are incorporated into the proposed system to simulate the uncertainty related to the roads' traffic conditions. The problem addressed in this work is a constrained optimization problem. Solutions to the addressed problem are yielded using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) in accordance with the fuzzy logic module. Simulated experiments over the city of Patras (Greece) show the efficiency of the developed approach.

AB For the path planning of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the ocean environment, in addition to the planned path length and safe obstacle avoidance, it is also necessary to pay attention to the impact of ocean currents on the planned path. Therefore, this paper improves the original D* algorithm, and adds the obstacle cost item and the steering angle cost item as constraints on the basis of the original cost function, thus ensuring the navigation safety of the AUV. Considering that ocean currents have a greater impact on the energy consumption of AUVs, this paper establishes a cost model for the impact of ocean currents on AUV energy consumption and applies it to the D* path planning algorithm, so that AUVs can use ocean currents to reduce energy consumption, which can be seen through simulation experiments. The simulation results show that the improvement of the algorithm can plan an optimal energy consumption path.

AB This paper investigates a novel model-free optimal controller for nonlinear autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). It is considered that the AUV considered as the case study is subject to multi-asymmetric constrained inputs. To achieve the optimal controller, a performance index function with exponential discounted value term and input hyperbolic function is developed. Since it is assumed that the AUV dynamics are completely unknown, a model-free integral reinforcement learning (RL) strategy is established. The suggested approach uses the sampled data pairs of input and states. To implement the model-free Integral RL optimal controller, a neural network structure is suggested to estimate the performance index function and control policy. Finally, a numerical simulation and comparative results are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposal.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) form mobile underwater networks to conduct underwater surveying missions cooperatively. Due to the severe turbulence caused by water currents, individual AUV has to adjust its heading constantly to ensure reaching destination. The coordinated AUV network increases the size of the surveying area, but leads to bigger challenges on maintaining AUV network locations. In this paper, we consider the localisation problem for AUVs in a mobile multi-hop underwater network. In our approach, to avoid the accumulating errors caused by the inertial measurement units, we periodically re-localise the AUV network through surfacing a set of AUVs as beacons. A beacon AUV surfaces to obtain its accurate location information from external sources, such as satellites, and then submerges to adjust the locations for remaining AUVs through acoustic communication. Simulation result shows that our approach greatly improves the localisation accuracy and energy efficiency of the AUV network.

AB This paper presents an online path planning algorithm for unmanned vehicles in charge of autonomous border patrol. In this Pursuit-Evasion game, the unmanned vehicle, acting as the pursuer, is required to capture multiple trespassers on its own before any of them reach a target safe house where they are safe from capture. The problem formulation is based on Isaacs' Target Guarding problem, but extended to the case of multiple evaders. The proposed path planning method is based on Rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) and is capable of producing trajectories within seconds to capture 2 or 3 evaders. Simulations are carried out to demonstrate that the resulting trajectories approach the optimal solution produced by a nonlinear programming-based numerical optimal control solver. Experiments are also conducted on unmanned ground vehicles to show the feasibility of implementing the proposed online path planning algorithm on physical applications.

AB This work is meant to report on activities at TU Delft on the design and implementation of a path-following system for an autonomous Toyota Prius. The design encompasses: finding the vehicle parameters for the actual vehicle to be used for control design; lateral and longitudinal controllers for steering and acceleration, respectively. The implementation covers the real-time aspects via LabVIEW from National Instruments and the real-life tests. The deployment of the system was enabled by a Spatial Dual Global Positioning System (GPS) system providing more accuracy than the regular GPS. The results discussed in this work represent the first autonomous tests on the Toyota Prius at TU Delft, and we expect the proposed system to be a benchmark against which to test more advanced solutions. The tests show that the system is able to perform in real-time while satisfying comfort and trajectory tracking requirements: in particular, the tracking error was within 16 cm, which is compatible with the 13 cm precision of the Spatial Dual GPS, whereas the longitudinal and lateral acceleration are within comfort levels as defined by available experimental studies.

AB This letter presents a free space trajectory optimization algorithm for autonomous driving, which decouples the collision-free trajectory generation problem into a Dual-Loop Iterative Anchoring Path Smoothing (DL-IAPS) problem and a Piecewise-Jerk Speed Optimization (PJSO) problem. The work leads to remarkable driving performance improvements including more robust and precise collision avoidance, higher control feasibility, higher computation efficiency and stricter driving comfort guarantee, compared with other existing algorithms. The advantages of our algorithm are attributed to our fast iterative collision checks with exact vehicle/obstacle shapes, strict non-holonomic dynamic constraints and accurate kinematics-based speed optimization. It has been validated that, through batch simulation and road experiments, compared with prior works, our algorithm is with the highest robustness and capable to maintain the lowest failure rate (similar to 7%) at nearly all test conditions, achieves 10x faster computational speed than other planners, fulfills 100% driving-comfort standards in complex driving scenarios, and does not induce significant time increase as boundaries or obstacles scale up.

AB Autonomous collision avoidance is a critical technology in intelligent control, which is of great significance for autonomous navigation and operation of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs). To enhance the autonomy of UUV collision avoidance and improve its adaptability to unstable forward-looking sonar observation and uncertain environments, we propose a novel Transformer-based Dual-Channel Self-attention (TDCS) architecture for UUV collision avoidance. TDCS is a network architecture composed of two encoders and a decoder, which integrates dynamic/static obstacle recognition, obstacle motion prediction, collision risk assessment, and collision avoidance decision. The two encoders extract the observation features of different sensors in parallel, and this dual-channel structure avoids the mutual interference of input information. Moreover, the two encoders are beneficial for adaptive learning to focus on sensor information with varying forms of representation. The fusion layer integrates the bimodal features extracted from different sensors by the dual-channel encoder. Finally, the fusion features and historical decisions are recombined through the decoder to form a new decision.

AB Three-dimensional detection is essential for autonomous driving and intelligent transportation system, as it enables vehicles to detect and track surrounding objects. Usually, autonomous vehicles are equipped with multiple sensing modalities to achieve robust and precise detection. This work focuses on fusing millimeter-wave radar data with monocular images, as radar can make up for the lack of explicit depth information. We propose a novel approach that fuses radar data and images at the feature level for 3-D detection. Radar points are first merged into a raw feature map with data set statistics by a novel transformation method. With this transformation, radar features can be extracted by convolutional neural networks and fused with image features. Object properties, including location, dimension, and rotation are regressed from the fused features. In this article, the proposed fusion strategy is implemented with a keypoint-based 3-D detection framework and evaluated on the challenging NuScenes data set. Experimental results suggest that the fusion of radar data promotes 3-D detection capability in public benchmarking.

TI A Roadmap for Autonomous Vehicles: State Tort Liability, Automobile
   Insurance, and Federal Safety Regulation
SO CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID PRODUCTS-LIABILITY; PROPOSALS
AB Driver error currently causes the vast majority of motor vehicle crashes. By eliminating the human driver, autonomous vehicles will prevent thousands of fatalities and serious bodily injuries, which makes a compelling safety case for policies that foster the rapid development of this technology. Major technological advances have occurred over the past decade, but there is widespread concern that the rate of development is hampered by uncertainty about manufacturer liabilities for a crash. Apparent variations in the requirements of state tort law across the country make it difficult for manufacturers to assess their liability exposure in the national market. The patchwork of state laws and the resultant uncertainty have prompted calls for the federal safety regulation of autonomous vehicles.
   The uncertainty seems to be the inevitable result of trying to predict how tort rules governing old technologies will apply to the new technology of automated driving. As I will attempt to demonstrate, however, well-established tort doctrines widely adopted by most states, if supplemented by two new federal safety regulations, would provide a comprehensive regulatory approach that would largely dissipate the costly legal uncertainty now looming over this emerging technology.
   The technology itself largely solves the most vexing tort problems for reasons that prior analyses have missed. Autonomous vehicles will transform the individualized behavior of human drivers into a collective, systemized form of driving. In effect, a single driver-the operating system-will guide an entire fleet of these vehicles, determining how each vehicle executes the dynamic driving task. When the fully functioning operating system causes a crash, the vehicle was engaged in systemized driving that should be evaluated through performance data for the fleet, regardless of the particular circumstances of the crash. Aggregate driving data can resolve otherwise difficult tort questions.
   Most importantly, the manufacturer would necessarily satisfy its tort obligation regarding the reasonably safe programming or design of the operating system if the aggregate, premarket testing data sufficiently show that the fleet of fully functioning autonomous vehicles performs at least twice as safely as conventional vehicles. To avoid liability for the crash of such a vehicle, the manufacturer must also adequately warn consumers about this inherent risk. Once again, the risk involves systemized driving performance, and so aggregate driving data provide the appropriate measure. Based on these data, auto insurers can establish the risk-adjusted annual premium for insuring the vehicle. By disclosing such a premium to consumers, the manufacturer would satisfy its obligation to warn about the inherent risk of crash, eliminating this final source of manufacturer liability for crashes caused by a fully functioning autonomous vehicle.
   The collective learning of state tort law can then inform federal regulations governing the reasonable safety of automated driving technologies. The foregoing analysis is based on tort rules that have been widely adopted across the country. States that do not follow the majority approach might reach different conclusions. To ensure that manufacturers face uniform obligations across the national market, the National Highway Transit Safety Administration could adopt two federal regulations that clearly fit within its proposed regulatory approach. Each derives from the associated tort obligations concerning adequate premarket testing and disclosure of the inherent risk of crash, respectively. These regulations would largely retain the role of tort law, because regulatory compliance would also satisfy the associated tort obligations in most states, while impliedly preempting these claims in the remaining states. The regulations would promote the federal interest in uniformity in a manner that minimizes the displacement of state tort law, thereby optimally solving the federalism problem.
   State tort law can then supplement the federal regulations in important instances, yielding a comprehensive regulatory approach. Within this legal framework, a regulatory-compliant autonomous vehicle would subject the manufacturer to tort liability only for crashes caused by malfunctioning physical hardware (strict products liability); malfunctions of the operating system due to either programming error (same) or third-party hacking (strict liability again, with an important caveat); the manufacturer's failure to adopt a reasonably safe design or to provide adequate warnings for ensuring safe deployment of the vehicle (an ordinary products liability claim); or the manufacturer's failure to treat consumers and bystanders equally when designing the vehicle and its operating system (an ordinary negligence claim). A manufacturer would also be subject to tort liability for not complying with the federal regulations (negligence per se). The potential liabilities would not be overly uncertain. Autonomous vehicles can be regulated in a manner that ensures reasonable safety without impeding the development of this life-saving technology.

The receiver, which has only 741 g and a compact structure, can realize decoupling for the channels by utilizing the orthogonal coils to receive the perpendicular flux. The integrated design of bipolar orthogonal power channel and unipolar parallel data channel effectively reduces crosstalk and realizes decoupling. To further improve the reliability of data transmission, the wave traps are added to suppress power crosstalk in data channel. The proposed structure is verified by experiments, the output power can reach 936 W with a dc-dc efficiency of 94.12%, and can also realize full-duplex communication.

AB This paper proposes a robust adaptive controller for the trajectory tracking of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) in the presence of model uncertainties, ocean currents, and time-varying environmental disturbances. First, a novel adaptive virtual velocity command is designed to estimate and compensate the unknown ocean currents acting on the ASV. Then, an improved torque controller is derived by applying filter operations and a set of auxiliary variables to avoid measuring the acceleration signals. To address the unknown dynamics parameters, a modified adaptive law with an alternative leakage term containing the parameter estimation error is developed. With this adaptive law, the convergence of both the estimated parameters and the tracking error can be achieved simultaneously. The whole closed-loop system's stability under environmental disturbances and parameter uncertainties is proved by the Lyapunov stability theory. Comparative simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The approach is decentralized in nature by incorporating a newly developed nonlinear control technique, namely the composite nonlinear feedback control, together with dynamic inversion. The overall control law consists of three hierarchical layers, namely, the kernel control, command generator and flight scheduling, and is implemented and verified in flight tests on the actual UAV helicopter.

AB This paper presents an extensive analysis of the integral line-of-sight (ILOS) guidance method for path-following tasks of underactuated marine vehicles, operating on and below the sea surface. It is shown that due to the embedded integral action, the guidance law makes the vessels follow straight lines by compensating for the drift effect of environmental disturbances, such as currents, wind, and waves. The ILOS guidance is first applied to a 2-D model of surface vessels that includes the underactauted sway dynamics of the vehicle as well as disturbances in the form of constant irrotational ocean currents and constant dynamic, attitude dependent, and forces. The actuated dynamics are not considered at this point. A Lyapunov closed-loop analysis yields explicit bounds on the guidance law gains to guarantee uniform global asymptotic stability (UGAS) and uniform local exponential stability (ULES). The complete kinematic and dynamic closed-loop system of the 3-D ILOS guidance law is analyzed in the following and hence extending the analysis to underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for the 3-D straight-line path-following applications in the presence of constant irrotational ocean currents. The actuated surge, pitch, and yaw dynamics are included in the analysis where the closed-loop system forms a cascade, and the properties of UGAS and ULES are shown. The 3-D ILOS control system is a generalization of the 2-D ILOS guidance. Finally, results from simulations and experiments are presented to validate and illustrate the theoretical results, where the 2-D ILOS guidance is applied to the cooperative autonomous robotics towing system vehicle and light AUV.

AB Autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) are marine vessels capable of performing various marine operations without a crew in a variety of cluttered and hostile water/ocean environments. For complex missions, there are increasing needs for deploying a fleet of ASVs instead of a single one to complete difficult tasks. Cooperative operations with a fleet of ASVs offer great advantages with enhanced capability and efficacy. Despite various application potentials, coordinated motion control of ASVs pose great challenges due to the multiplicity of ASVs, complexity of intravehicle interactions and fleet formation with collision avoidance requirements, and scarcity of communication bandwidths in sea environments. Coordinated control of multiple ASVs has received considerable attention in the last decade. This article provides an overview of recent advances in coordinated control of multiple ASVs. First, some challenging issues and scenarios in motion control of ASVs are presented. Next, coordinated control architecture and methods of multiple ASVs are briefly discussed. Then, recent results on trajectory-guided, path-guided, and target-guided coordinated control of multiple ASVs are reviewed in detail. Finally, several theoretical and technical issues are suggested to direct future investigations including network-based coordination, event-triggered coordination, collision-free coordination, optimization-based coordination, data-driven coordination of ASVs, and task-region-oriented coordination of multiple ASVs and autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB The development of a control system for the dive plane control of non-linear biorobotic autonomous underwater vehicles, equipped with pectoral-like fins, is the subject of this paper. Marine animals use pectoral fins for swimming smoothly. The fins are assumed to be oscillating with a combined pitch and heave motion and therefore produce unsteady control forces. The objective is to control the depth of the vehicle. The mean angle of pitch motion of the fin is used as a control variable. A computational-fluid-dynamics-based parameterisation of the fin forces is used for control system design. A robust servo regulator for the control of the depth of the vehicle, based on the non-linear internal model principle, is derived. For the control law derivation, an exosystem of third order is introduced, and the non-linear time-varying biorobotic autonomous underwater vehicle model, including the fin forces, is represented as a non-linear autonomous system in an extended state space. The control system includes the internal model of a k-fold exosystem, where k is a positive integer chosen by the designer. It is shown that in the closed-loop system, all the harmonic components of order up to k of the tracking error are suppressed. Simulation results are presented which show that the servo regulator accomplishes accurate depth control despite uncertainties in the model parameters.

AB Due to the complexity and uncertainty of the traffic, planning for autonomous driving (AD) on highway is challenging. Traditional planning algorithms have the problems of low and unstable efficiency, which reduces the real-time performance of the autonomous vehicle (AV). Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is an emerging and promising method that has achieved amazing performance in many fields. In this paper, we propose a novel planning approach based on soft actor critic (SAC) with hybrid actions. The algorithm takes the structured information of the ego vehicle and the surroundings as input, and generates a termination state on the Frenet space for ego vehicle, then a feasible and continuous spatiotemporal trajectory will be output by a polynomial planner based on the intermediate state. Different from other sampling-based planning methods, only single polynomial planning is required, which improves planning efficiency significantly. Experiments show that DRL agent with hybrid actions is more secure than the agents with only continuous or discrete actions. Compared with other planning methods, the proposed algorithm has the least and most robust time for planning in different scenarios.

AB Increased growth in the global unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) (drone) industry has expanded possibilities for fully autonomous UAV applications. A particular application which has in part motivated this research is the use of UAV in wide area search and surveillance operations in unstructured outdoor environments. The critical issue with such environments is the lack of structured features that could aid in autonomous flight, such as road lines or paths. In this letter, we propose an end-to-end multi-task regression-based learning approach capable of defining flight commands for navigation and exploration under the forest canopy, regardless of the presence of trails or additional sensors (i.e., GPS). Training and testing are performed using a software in the loop pipeline, which allows for a detailed evaluation against state-of-the-art pose estimation techniques. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach excels in performing dense exploration within the required search perimeter, is capable of covering wider search regions, generalises to previously unseen and unexplored environments and outperforms contemporary state-of-the-art techniques.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are important mobile equipment for ocean observation. Subsea docking stations are used to charge AUV batteries to increase their cruise duration. Here, a universal wireless charging platform with a novel transmitter is developed to address the issues of poor compatibility existing in conventional docking stations. In order to guarantee a sufficient charging area and reduce copper losses, the proposed transmitter is designed to have a bulged-structure surrounding coil and a centre coil in coaxial. Moreover, the parameters of the transmitter that impact the magnetic flux density are analysed and optimized by non-linear programming by Quadratic Lagrangian (NLPQL) algorithm to achieve a field with desirable intensity and uniformity. The characteristics of the circuits under single-load and double-load conditions have been tested in air and tank experiments. The results verify that the proposed platform achieves both the universality and misalignment tolerance requirements.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be further optimized as tools on-board ships with the development of lacking infrastructure, like their recovery at sea. Current technologies focus on vision-based systems with little consideration for ship motion. A novel autonomous landing technique is tested experimentally, featuring acoustic positioning to allow for landings in a wider breadth of conditions and to reduce the reliance on specially designed landing targets. A potential fields path planner is used to adapt for ship motion and provide obstacle avoidance and natural biasing away from the heaving ship deck. A sea state predictor is used to compensate for harsher sea conditions and ship motion, allowing the UAV to look for appropriate landing windows in higher sea states. Autonomous landings are demonstrated in a lab setting for sea conditions up to, and including, sea state 5. The ship motions are defined using real sea trials data from the decommissioned HMCS Nipigon.

AB The Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) studied in this paper can land and rest on the seafloor using a mooring system. In order to analyze its landing strategies and influencing factors, kinematics and dynamics models of three-dimensional motion of the AUV are established. Forces' mathematic models of variable buoyancy system and vertical thrusters are developed and control algorithm of vertical thrusters is designed. Based on the above-mentioned models, landing simulation system is built using S-function of Matlab. Two kinds of landing strategies of the AUV with mooring system are proposed, i.e., diving freely under the effect of negative buoyancy and landing under the control of vertical thrusters. On these bases, the effects of mass and position of the water entering into the AUV on landing parameters are analyzed. Finally, the influences of vertical thrusters on landing process are discussed through comparing the two landing strategies.

ID CLASSIFICATION; TRANSMISSION
AB In this paper, we focus on the use of linear sensor networks (LSNs) to monitor underwater pipelines. We propose the use of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to move along pipeline segments and collect data from the sensor nodes (SNs). Each AUV then delivers the collected data to the surface sink at the end of the corresponding LSN segment. In turn, the surface sink transmits the collected data to the network control center using any of the communication technologies that are available in the area such as WiMAX, cellular, and satellite. The use of AUVs for data collection offers considerable advantages including flexibility in SN placement, considerable energy savings and reduced interference, hidden terminal problems, and collisions. We also provide, different AUV movement strategies and analyze the effect of various network design parameters on network performance metrics such as packet delivery ratio and end-to-end delay.

AB It is well known that the reduced-order (least-order) H-infinity control problem is a rank minimization problem subject to linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints which is hard to solve due to the non-convexity of the objective and the trace heuristic is simple and efficient one among various heuristics that approximate the rank minimization problem. In this paper, a theoretical insight into the trade-off between the controller order and the performance of the closed-loop system is given. Autopilots (forward speed, heading and depth) for an autonomous underwater vehicle are synthesized based upon the trace heuristic. Simulation results as well as experimental results of heading control show that the reduced-order autopilots are desirable for practical implementation due to their simple structures and slight performance degradation.

AB Thanks to comprehensive potential with new access technology, massive bandwidths and ultrahigh reliability, it is highly expected that recent 5G network and beyond 5G network (B5G) will fundamentally influence various autonomous systems, applications and devices. Also, Artificial intelligence (Ai) is expanding its applicability to numerous existing and next generation systems and research branches. Conversely, Ai can be utilized to threaten 5G-enabled components as well as to attack Ai-based systems and machine learning algorithms. So, it is indispensable to investigate new Ai-based security threats and solutions in 5G-enabled smart cities. in this article, we introduce Ai-driven 5G integrated virtual emotion system, called 5G-i-VEmoSYS, which covers Ai-VEmoBAR, Ai-VEmoFLOW, and Ai-VEmoMAP as applications in 5G environments. First, we explain how to operate those Ai-driven promising applications in 5G-enabled components including autonomous vehicles, smart UAVs or drones. Also, we describe how to perform those applications in public areas and private areas with different perspectives. Then, we carefully deal with research challenges, security threats and issues according to the proposed 5G-i-VEmoSYS.

AB As a typical Internet of Things (IoT) application of the transmission grid, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is the most feasible solution to replace conventional human maintenance resources during the inspection of power transmission lines. However, limited by the flying range and endurance time, it cannot realize the goal of full-autonomous inspection proposed by the State Grid. Based on the UAV inspection technology and the emerging UAV hangar, a new idea of using smart hangar as a connection point to realize full-autonomous inspection of UAV is proposed in this paper. And then making full use of the smart hangar to solve the battery capacity problem existing in the process of autonomous inspection of UAV. Finally, according to the inspection requirements of transmission towers, the fixed-wing UAV is used for long-distance inspection, and the path planning mathematical model considering the risk probabilities of towers and objective functions is established. Simulation results show that the scheme proposed in this paper can effectively solve the existed problems of UAV inspection.

AB We have developed an autonomous vehicle steering control algorithm to aid with harvesting and spraying tasks in greenhouses to alleviate the problem of shortage of workers. We use an overhead guide constructed in the greenhouse to mark the desired path of the vehicle. A rigid bar is then connected from the guide to the vehicle. The vehicle steers and corrects itself by sensing the angle and distance of the vehicle from the guide. The control algorithm was developed for a two-dimensional kinematic vehicle model which was found to be valid for low-speed vehicles. The steering control was examined by numerical simulation in order to investigate the effects of parameters such as control-point location on stability deviations of the vehicle path. The asymptotic stability of the system was verified analytically and confirmed using numerical simulations. The control system was then simulated using a multibody dynamics simulation in conditions that better simulated an agricultural environment, thus confirming that the control system also maintained stability under rough conditions. Finally, in accordance with the control algorithm and the simulations, a proof-of-concept prototype of the vehicle was developed and the control algorithm was successfully deployed on a set of experiments.

AB This study addresses the finite-time tracking control problem for autonomous airships with uncertainties and external disturbances. Six-degree-of-freedom kinematics and dynamics equations are established by considering the model uncertainties and external disturbances. To handle the model uncertainties and external disturbances, a finite-time sliding mode disturbance observer (DOB) is designed. To have a good tracking performance, a finite-time command-filtered backstepping-supertwisting controller is proposed with DOB. By using Lyapunov theory, the finite-time convergence of tracking errors and the stability of the control method is proved. Finally, the simulation results show that the controller can track the desired trajectory well in spite of model uncertainties and external disturbances.

AB In this paper, optimal control is applied in the path-following control problem for the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) when the geometry information of path is known and will not change over time. Aiming at the problem that the optimization time is too long in one control step for complex nonlinear problems, a path-following control method based on Simplified Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (S-DDPG) algorithm is proposed. In S-DDPG, only the reward in the current state is considered, and the future reward does not need to be predicted, which avoids generating amount of meaningless failed samples and simplifies the training process of neural networks (NNs). The training is performed and completed offline before the beginning of path-following where the NNs are directly used as the controller. The simulation results show that the S-DDPG can make the AUV complete path-following tasks and has obvious advantages compared with other methods.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Traffic sign detection is an important component of autonomous vehicles. There is still a mismatch problem between the existing detection algorithm and its practical application in real traffic scenes, which is mainly due to the detection accuracy and data acquisition. To tackle this problem, this study proposed an improved sparse R-CNN that integrates coordinate attention block with ResNeSt and builds a feature pyramid to modify the backbone, which enables the extracted features to focus on important information, and improves the detection accuracy. In order to obtain more diverse data, the augmentation method used is specifically designed for complex traffic scenarios, and we also present a traffic sign dataset in this study. For on-road autonomous vehicles, we designed two modules, self-adaption augmentation (SAA) and detection time augmentation (DTA), to improve the robustness of the detection algorithm. The evaluations on traffic sign datasets and on-road testing demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Bearings-only target tracking is commonly used in many fields, like air or sea traffic monitoring, tracking a member in a formation, and military applications. When tracking with synchronous passive multisensor systems, each sensor provides a line-of-sight measurement. They are plugged into an iterative least squares algorithm to estimate the unknown target position vector. Instead of using iterative least squares, this paper presents a deep-learning based framework for the bearing-only target tracking process, applicable for any bearings-only target tracking task. As a data-driven method, the proposed deep-learning framework offers several advantages over the traditional iterative least squares. To demonstrate the proposed approach, a scenario of tracking an autonomous underwater vehicle approaching an underwater docking station is considered. There, several passive sensors are mounted near a docking station to enable accurate localization of an approaching autonomous underwater vehicle. Simulation results show the proposed framework obtains better accuracy compared to the iterative least squares algorithm.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT VEHICLES

DT Article
DE Point cloud stitch; matching score; scene reconstruction
AB Continuous point cloud stitching provides accurate and rapid environmental information for mapping, which plays an essential role in autonomous vehicles. Many methods related to autonomous vehicles are either inaccurate or time-consuming when they reconstruct large scenes. In this work, a feature matching score-based stitching method to reconstruct environments for autonomous vehicles is proposed. The purpose of the method is to address the problems of stitching quality and time consumption by using the feature match- completeness scores. The feature matching score is obtained by calculating the matching rate within an adjacent image pairs that produces a frame of point cloud. The score maintains the correct points, so fewer points require to be stitched. Then, the corresponding criterion is given to evaluate the performance of stitching candidate point clouds.

AB A new algorithm called Huber-based iterated divided difference filtering (HIDDF) is derived and applied to cooperative localization of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) supported by a single surface leader. The position states are estimated using acoustic range measurements relative to the leader, in which some disadvantages such as weak observability, large initial error and contaminated measurements with outliers are inherent. By integrating both merits of iterated divided difference filtering (IDDF) and Huber's M-estimation methodology, the new filtering method could not only achieve more accurate estimation and faster convergence contrast to standard divided difference filtering (DDF) in conditions of weak observability and large initial error, but also exhibit robustness with respect to outlier measurements, for which the standard IDDF would exhibit severe degradation in estimation accuracy. The correctness as well as validity of the algorithm is demonstrated through experiment results.

AB A few decades ago, the idea of a car driving without human assistance was something inconceivable. With the advent of deep learning-based machine learning in artificial intelligence, this imaginary idea has become part of our life. Like in other fields, these technological revolutions have brought drastic changes to the field of automated driving systems. The autonomous vehicle is in the transition state between level 3 and level 4 of automation, but many mysteries are still waiting to be solved. Understanding the environment as precisely as a human driver is still far in the future. To attain human perception requires the capturing of extensive surrounding information that depends on the onboard sensors installed on the vehicle. Because the recent autonomous vehicle is equipped with several sensors, it captures surrounding information in diverse forms. Combining these multi-domain data with sensor fusion is the open area of research that is considered in this paper. Along with sensor fusion, another area of prime importance that is necessary to be explored is the prediction of pedestrian intentions. Though the study of the prediction of a pedestrian's intentions started approximately fifteen years ago, most of the research is based on detection rather than intention. Furthermore, this paper also discusses related research in the field of prediction of the pedestrian's intentions. At the end of the article, this review paper includes open questions, challenges, and proposed solutions.

AB Considering personalized driving preferences, a new decision-making framework is developed using a differential game approach to resolve the driving conflicts of autonomous vehicles (AVs) at unsignalized intersections. To realize human-like driving and personalized decision-making, driving aggressiveness is first defined for AVs. To improve driving safety, a Gaussian potential field model is built for collision risk assessment. Besides, in the proposed decision-making framework, the collision risk assessment model is further used to reduce the computational complexity based on an event-triggered mechanism. In the construction of payoff function, both driving safety and passing efficiency are comprehensively considered, and the driving aggressiveness is also reflected. Two kinds of equilibrium solution to the differential game, i.e., the Nash equilibrium and Stackelberg equilibrium, are discussed and solved. Finally, the proposed decision-making algorithm is tested through a hardware-in-the-loop testing platform, and its feasibility, effectiveness, and real-time implementation performance are validated.

AB Recent research on autonomous vehicles (AVs) shows a substantive dive into the technical aspects of AVs, but our understanding of the secondary effects of AVs is minimal in comparison. This article offers a look at how automation of one of the cornerstones of many municipal governments solid waste collection could be altered with the advent of AVs. In this article, fill-cost accounting is used to assess how changing different inputs to the collection process, including direct, indirect, and capital costs, could yield savings for a municipal government. To conduct the analysis, data from the North Carolina Benchmarking Project for 2016-17 were evaluated, a range of assumptions were made based on the best available information on automation, and three cost scenarios were calculated for two North Carolina cities with differing means of collection today. The findings indicate savings in the long run that could potentially reduce the cost of collecting solid waste by 32-63 percent.

AB This article addresses one quadruple-rudder allocation method for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with X rudder, in which all of the rudders can be operated independently. By considering X rudder's character, one X-rudder AUV's control information frame is designed. It contains the anti-normalization method based on virtual rudders and one quadruple-rudder allocation with Levy flight character. This quadruple-rudder allocation method has the advantages of Levy flight and avoids the shaking problem. One contrast simulation of a lawn mower path following mission in three-dimensional (3D) space is performed. The results of simulation show that the quadruple-rudder allocation with Levy flight character can offer accurate and reliable control ability. Besides that, compared to the quadruple-rudder allocation based on pseudoinverse and fixed point iteration, the method designed with Levy flight character can achieve the same mission with less X rudder's operation.

AB A guidance law, based on supervisory recurrent fuzzy neural network control (SRFNNC), is proposed for the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) guidance systems. This SRFNNC system is comprised of a recurrent fuzzy neural network (RFNN) controller and a supervisory controller. The RFNN controller is used to mimic an ideal controller and the supervisory controller is designed to compensate for the approximation error between the RFNN controller and the ideal controller. The proposed design method is applied to investigate the active acoustic homing guidance of an AUV, which is affected by sonar propagation time-delay and measurement noise. A comparison is made for the proposed SRFNNC, a proportional navigation (PN) and a sliding-mode control (SMC) guidance laws. Simulation results show that the proposed SRFNNC guidance law is more robust and can obtain smaller miss distance than the PN and SMC guidance laws.

AB Due to its applications in marine research, oceanographic, and undersea exploration, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and the related control algorithms recently have been under intense investigation. In this work, we address target detection and tracking issues, proposing a control strategy that is able to benefit from the cooperation among robots within the fleet. In particular, we introduce a behavior-based planner for cooperative AUVs, proposing an algorithm that is able to search and recognize targets in both static and dynamic scenarios. With no a priori information about the surrounding environment, robots cover an unknown area with the goal of finding objects of interest. When a target is found, the AUVs' goal is to classify (fixed target) or track (mobile target) the target, with no information about target trajectory and with formation constraints. Results demonstrate the good overall performance of the proposed algorithm in both scenarios.

AB In the recent years autonomous flying vehicles are being increasingly used in both civil and military areas. With the advancement of the technology it has become possible to test efficiently and cost-effectively different autonomous flight control concepts and design variations using small-scale aerial vehicles. In this paper the stabilization problem of the quad-rotor rotorcraft using bounded feedback controllers is investigated. Five different types of nonlinear feedback laws with saturation elements, previously proposed for global control of systems with multiple integrators, are applied and tested to control the quad-rotor rotorcraft roll and pitch angles. The results obtained from autonomous flight simulations and real time experiments with the Draganflyer V Ti four-rotor mini-rotorcraft are analyzed with respect to the structural simplicity of the control schemes and the transient performance of the closed-loop system.

AB This paper introduces an underwater docking procedure for the test-bed autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) platform called ISiMI using one charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. The AUV is optically guided by lights mounted around the entrance of a docking station and a vision system consisting of a CCD camera and a frame grabber in the AUV. This paper presents an image processing procedure to identify the dock by discriminating between light images, and proposes a final approach algorithm based on the vision guidance. A signal processing technique to remove noise on the defused grabbed light images is introduced, and a two-stage final approach for stable docking at the terminal instant is suggested. A vision-guidance controller was designed with conventional PID controllers for the vertical plane and the horizontal plane. Experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the vision-guided docking system of the AUV. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB It is of great interest for autonomous vehicles to predict the trajectory of other vehicles when planning a safe trajectory. To accurately predict the trajectory of the target vehicle, the interaction between vehicles must be considered. Interaction aware prediction methods track the previous trajectories of both the target vehicle and its surrounding vehicles. In this study, the authors consider trajectory prediction as a sequence-to-sequence prediction problem. They tackle this problem with an LSTM encoder-decoder framework. Moreover, they propose two spatial-attention mechanisms to account for the interaction between vehicles, i.e. context attention and lane attention. Spatial-attention mechanisms adopt the selective-attention mechanism of human drivers. They choose context vectors to help the model understand the surrounding environment better and thus improve its prediction accuracy. They evaluate the authors' methods on the highD data set recorded in German highways with root mean squared error metric. Their experimental results show superior performance to other state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/momo1986/Spatial-attention.

AB Navigation in complex urban environments is very difficult, mainly due to perceptual uncertainty caused by obstructions in the field of view. The perceptual uncertainty is mainly due to sensors obstructed by obstacles. This has a significant impact on the safety of autonomous vehicles. Existing approaches based on partially observable Markov decision processes or reinforcement learning for the uncertainty problem may lead to conservative planning and expensive computation. We propose caution-driven networks combined with distributional reinforcement learning fully parameterized quantile function, which termed Intrinsic caution module - fully parameterized quantile function (ICM-FQF). The method is also applied in the continuous action space. The method is used to evaluate two challenging scenarios, pedestrians crossing with occlusion and a unsignalized intersection with a limited field of view. The algorithm is trained and evaluated using the CARLA simulator. Compared to conventional RL algorithms, the method makes smarter decisions and reduces the rate of collisions.

AB Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to deal with the steady increase in road traffic while solving transportation related issues such as traffic congestion, pollution, and road safety. Therefore, CAVs are becoming increasingly popular and viewed as the next generation transportation solution. Although modular advancements have been achieved in the development of CAVs, these efforts are not fully integrated to operationalize CAVs in realistic driving scenarios. This paper surveys a wide range of efforts reported in the literature about the CAV developments, summarizes the CAV impacts from a statistical perspective, explores current state of practice in the field of CAVs in terms of autonomy technologies, communication backbone, and computation needs. Furthermore, this paper provides general guidance on how transportation infrastructures need to be prepared in order to effectively operationalize CAVs. The paper also identifies challenges that need to be addressed in near future for effective and reliable adoption of CAVs.

AB In this paper, we present an onboard monocular vision system for autonomous takeoff, hovering and landing of a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV). Since pose information with metric scale is critical for autonomous flight of a MAV, we present a novel solution to six degrees of freedom (DOF) pose estimation. It is based on a single image of a typical landing pad which consists of the letter "H" surrounded by a circle. A vision algorithm for robust and real-time landing pad recognition is implemented. Then the 5 DOF pose is estimated from the elliptic projection of the circle by using projective geometry. The remaining geometric ambiguity is resolved by incorporating the gravity vector estimated by the inertial measurement unit (IMU). The last degree of freedom pose, yaw angle of the MAV, is estimated from the ellipse fitted from the letter "H". The efficiency of the presented vision system is demonstrated comprehensively by comparing it to ground truth data provided by a tracking system and by using its pose estimates as control inputs to autonomous flights of a quadrotor.

AB Autonomous vehicles are becoming a reality. In particular, podcars were already launched in pilot projects. The wide use of such vehicles for personal transportation in urban areas is then just a matter of time and poses several research challenges and technical issues to the artificial intelligence and multiagent communities. This article focuses on issues related to the processing of demands for these vehicles and on routing them in an efficient way. An agent-based approach is proposed, which considers some variants for the processing of demands and for the routing. First, a centralized version is discussed. Then, extensions deal with decentralized routing, with enroute planning, intervehicle communication, and with a market-based approach where the manager of the service runs an auction to determine which customer to serve. All these variants aim at testing alternatives in order to shed light onto questions such as how the podcar service is to be provided and how trips have to be planned, as well as address challenges related to the management. Results show that, although this service can be provided by a central authority, communication, as well as reliability and fault-tolerance, should not be neglected.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
AB Intersections are major bottlenecks for road traffic, as well as the origin of many accidents. Efficient management of traffic at intersections is required to ensure both safety and efficiency. Yet, the traditional solutions (static signs, traffic lights) are limited in their efficiency as they consider the flow of vehicles and not the vehicles at the microscopic level. By using inter-vehicular communication of connected vehicles, recent works have shown the possibility to have a great increase in the number of evacuated vehicles thanks to the possibility to give an individual right-of-way directly to each vehicle. In this context of intersections of cooperative vehicles, the scheduling of this right-of-way in order to maximize the throughput of the intersection is still a challenging task, with regard to the hybrid and dynamic aspects of the problem. In this paper, we propose an approach based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to efficiently distribute the right-of-way to each vehicle. A Markov Decision Process model of intersections of cooperative vehicles, enabling the application of DRL, is proposed. The performance of the DRL-based scheduling is then compared with classic traffic lights, and with two state-of-the-art cooperative scheduling policies, showing the benefits of the approach (increase of the flow, reduction of CO2 emissions).

AB This paper examines the role played by vehicle models. and their impact on the performance of sensor-based navigation systems for autonomous land vehicles. In a,navigation system, information from internal and external vehicle sensors is combined to estimate the motion of the vehicle. However, while the issue of sensing and the effects of sensor accuracy have been widely studied, there are few results or insights into the complementary role played by the vehicle model. This paper has two main contributions: a theoretical analysis of the role of the vehicle model in navigation system performance, and an empirical study of three models of increasing complexity, used in a navigation system for a conventional road vehicle. The theoretical analysis focuses on understanding the effect of estimation errors caused by approximations to the "true" vehicle model. It shows that while substantial performance improvements can be obtained from better vehicle modeling, there is, in general, no definitive "best" model for such complex nonlinear estimation problems. The empirical study shows that an appropriate choice of a higher order model can lead to significant improvements in the performance of the navigation system. However, the highest order model (which incorporates simple vehicle dynamics) suffers from problems related to the observability of some of its parameters. We show how this problem can be overcome through the imposition of weak constraints.

AB In this paper, we study the quantitative design paradigm (QDP) of tracing control for a class of second-order system and further extend this to solve the trajectory tracking problem of autonomous underwater vehicles. The key merit of QDP is the capability of assigning some quantitative indices (e.g., overshoot and convergence time). To pursue performance enhancement with regard to tracking performance and bandwidth saving, a sectionalized event-triggered mechanism (SETM) incorporated with prespecified convergence time is proposed. To recognize the peculiarities of the lumped disturbances, an estimation-triggered neural network (ETNN) is designed via a property indicator, such that the disturbances that deteriorate the performance of the closed-loop system will be compensated and beneficial disturbances will be reserved otherwise, enabling less energy consumption without sacrificing the tracking performance. Theoretical analysis and simulation results are provided and analyzed, validating the performance and efficiency of the proposed solution.

ID STABILITY
AB This paper proposes a system for guidance of autonomous vehicles based on a generalized robust model-predictive control (R-MPC) technique. It offers two scenarios, in which R-MPC is used to provide optimized motion plans guaranteed to satisfy constraints and avoid obstacles in the presence of bounded uncertainty. The first scenario involves amilitary unmanned aerial vehicle flying over a target, while avoiding enemy defenses. The second scenario involves an assistive care robot safely navigating to waypoints throughout a cluttered home. In each case, obstacles are represented as a collection of linear inequality constraints that adapt to changes in the environment. Results show that when R-MPC is formulated using a series of positive-semidefinite relaxations on linear inequality constraints, safe optimum trajectories can be planned by solving a convex quadratic program. When formulated in terms of perturbations on feedback predictions, this solution is guaranteed to be robustly stable.

AB This paper addresses on a horizontal waypoint tracking problem for a class of nonlinear autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with actuator saturations while keeping its constant surge speed. The concerned problem is formulated as an exponential stabilization of the error dynamics with respect to the desired surge speed and the desired yaw angle determined from the line of sight. It is shown that the feedback linearization technique makes the separate design of the available control inputs, the propeller thrust and the rudder angle, possible. By using the sector nonlinearity, the error dynamics is modeled as a polytopic linear parameter varying (LPV) system. Then, sufficient linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions for its regional exponential stabilizability are derived in the sense of Lyapunov stability criterion. An example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work represents one of the first successful applications of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) for interdisciplinary coastal research. A monitoring mission to study the shape and estimate the initial dilution of the S. Jacinto sewage outfall plume using an AUV was performed on July 2002. An efficient sampling strategy enabling greater improvements in spatial and temporal range of detection demonstrated that the sewage effluent plume can be clearly traced using naturally occurring tracers in the wastewater. The outfall plume was found at the surface highly influenced by the weak stratification and low currents. Dilution varying with distance downstream was estimated from the plume rise over the outfall diffuser until a nearly constant value of 130:1, 60 m from the diffuser, indicating the near field end. Our results demonstrate that AUVs can provide high-quality measurements of physical properties of effluent plumes in a very effective manner and valuable considerations about the initial mixing processes under real oceanic conditions can be further investigated.

AB The design of high-performance state estimators for future autonomous vehicles constitutes a challenging task, because of the rising complexity and demand for operational safety. In this application, a vehicle state observer with a focus on the estimation of the quantities position, yaw angle, velocity, and yaw rate, which are necessary for a path following control for an autonomous vehicle, is discussed. The synthesis of the vehicle's observer model is a trade-off between modelling complexity and performance. To cope with the vehicle still stand situations, the framework provides an automatic event handling functionality. Moreover, by means of an efficient root search algorithm, map-based information on the current road boundaries can be determined. An extended moving horizon state estimation algorithm enables the incorporation of delayed low bandwidth Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurementsincluding out of sequence measurementsas well as the possibility to limit the vehicle position change through the knowledge of the road boundaries. Finally, different moving horizon observer configurations are assessed in a comprehensive case study, which are compared to a conventional extended Kalman filter. These rely on real-world experiment data from vehicle testdrive experiments, which show very promising results for the proposed approach.

AB Growing interest has recently been paid to the development of autonomous vehicle scenarios, and corresponding research is being conducted on various methodologies and on the generation of scenarios including technological elements. However, most studies have focused on frequently-occurring accident types or representative accident situations; thus, there is a lack of studies on scenarios considering unpredictable accidents. Proper preparation is required for accident situations because even a small traffic accident that is less likely to occur can lead to fatalities if it is difficult to predict. Accordingly, this study established accident situations based on the Pegasus layer model by using unstructured text data to explain traffic accidents on expressways in Korea. The established accident situations were classified into three types (Typical Traffic/Critical Traffic/Edge Case) according to frequency. Topic modeling was applied to the Edge Case class, i.e., the least likely to occur and thus difficult to predict, to analyze the characteristics of groups and develop risk-situation scenarios for autonomous vehicles based on actual accident data.

AB Many governments find it challenging to set up a regulatory regime to govern rapidly developing Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) technologies empowered by Artificial Intelligence. This paper analyzes flexible regulation as a tool for assessing regulatory reforms that govern disruptive innovations such as AVs. After defining flexible regulation as regulation that gives regulated entities choices for how to comply with the regulatory objectives, this paper develops Regulatory Flexibility Indicators (RFI) for rule structure, enforcement structure, and regulatory feedback. We study AVs regulatory reforms that took place recently in the United Kingdom and South Korea, focusing on how such reforms have enhanced regulation flexibility. This paper finds that regulatory governance in the United Kingdom is more flexible than in South Korea, indicating aspects of further reforms for improving regulatory flexibility.

ID STEERING CONTROL; MANEUVER
AB In this study, we propose an adaptive path planning model and tracking control method for collision avoidance and lane-changing manoeuvres on highways in rainy weather. Considering the human-vehicle-road interaction, we developed an adaptive lane change system that consists of an intelligent trajectory planning and tracking controller. Gaussian distribution was introduced to evaluate the impact of rain on the pavement characteristics and deduce adaptive lane-change trajectories. Subsequently, a score-based decision mechanism and multilevel autonomous driving mode that considers safety, comfort, and efficiency were proposed. A tracking controller was designed using a linearised model predictive control method. Finally, using simulated scenarios, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method were demonstrated. The results obtained herein are a valuable resource that can be used to develop an intelligent lane change system for autonomous vehicles and can help improve highway traffic safety and efficiency in adverse weather conditions.

AB For the complete coverage path planning of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), a new strategy with Glasius bio-inspired neural network (GBNN) algorithm with discrete and centralized programming is proposed. The basic modeling for multi-AUVs complete coverage problem based on grid map and neural network is discussed first. Then, the design for single AUV complete coverage is introduced based on GBNN algorithm which is a new developed tool with small amount of calculation and high efficiency. In order to solve the difficulty of single AUV full coverage task of large water range, the multi-AUV full coverage discrete and centralized programming is proposed based on GBNN algorithm. The simulation experiment is conducted to confirm that through the proposed algorithm, multi-AUVs can plan reasonable and collision-free coverage path and reach full coverage on the same task area with division of labor and cooperation.

AB In this paper, an iterative adaptive dynamic programming algorithm is proposed to deal with the optimal trajectory-tracking control problems for autonomous underwater vehicle. Two iteration procedures are used in the method, which are the i-iteration and the j-iteration.The i-iteration aims to obtain iterative trajectory-tracking control laws and the j-iteration aims to obtain iterative value functions in the i-iteration. The optimal tracking control problem is converted into an optimal regulation problem by system transformation. Then the optimal regulation problem is solved by the policy iteration adaptive dynamic programming algorithm. The policy iteration algorithm is the interacting policy and value iteration algorithms. The neural networks are used to realize the proposed algorithm and the convergence and optimality properties of the proposed algorithm are analysed. Finally, simulation example is given to show the performance of the iterative adaptive dynamic programming algorithm.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are highly nonlinear underactuated systems with uncertain dynamics and a challenging control problem. The main focus of this paper is to present a control law that shows desirable performance in the presence of modeling uncertainties. In this study, uncertainties are considered to be bounded and the AUV mathematical model is obtained in the presence of such uncertainties. Forces and torques applied to the AUV are also designed using a nonlinear dynamic controller. Appropriate adaptive rules are also presented to overcome system uncertainties and external disturbances. The adaptive nonlinear dynamic controller is designed based on upper bounds of system uncertainties and its stability is proven using the Lyapunov theory. In this article, the performance of the proposed control algorithm for tracking reference trajectories in an obstacle-rich environment is investigated. Therefore, the control algorithm is combined with potential fields for obstacle avoidance. Obtained results show the efficiency of the proposed controller.

AB This paper proposes a new heuristic search technique for obstacle avoidance of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that are equipped with a looking-ahead obstacle-avoidance sonar. The fuzzy relation between the sonar sections and the properties of a real-time environment is used as a core concept. The Lukasiewicz fuzzy implication operator is used in Bandler and Kohout's Triangle Subproduct to calculate the relationship between the fuzzy relation and its transposed relation. This product relation the reveals the characteristics and interrelationships of the sonar sections. A direction of the sonar section that has good characteristics is selected as the successive heading for obstacle avoidance of AUVs. The simulation results clearly demonstrate that the heuristic search technique, which uses the BK-product of a fuzzy relation with a sonar partitioned into seven sections, enables AUVs to navigate safely through the obstacle to the goal with the optimal path.

AB An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) can only operate for a limited time due to limited energy supplied by embedded battery. Its operation can be prolonged when the battery is recharged at an underwater docking station. Several researches had been conducted for the docking of AUV using vision. Most of them use image-based visual servoing which focuses solely on features of the docking station to guide the AUV. However, image features are highly non-linear function of camera pose. Furthermore, many collisions occurred during docking operation which may damage the platforms if not docked carefully. In this paper, a switching target in position-based visual servoing is proposed for the AUV to securely dock inside the station. The features of the docking station are extracted using image processing. Then, simulation is conducted using the proposed method showed that the AUV is able to enter the docking station without any collision.

AB Geostatistics has been successfully used to analyse and characterize the spatial variability of environmental properties. Besides providing estimated values at unsampled locations, geostatistics measures the accuracy of the estimate, which is a significant advantage over traditional methods used to assess pollution. This work uses universal block kriging to model and map the spatial distribution of salinity measurements gathered by an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle in a sea outfall monitoring campaign. The aim is to distinguish the effluent plume from the receiving waters, characterizing its spatial variability in the vicinity of the discharge and estimating dilution. The results demonstrate that geostatistical methodology can provide good estimates of the dispersion of effluents, which are valuable in assessing the environmental impact and managing sea outfalls. Moreover, since accurate measurements of the plume's dilution are rare, these studies may be very helpful in the future to validate dispersion models.

DE Bayesian network; CAV; car following; location inference; VANET
ID STATE ESTIMATION; SCHEME
AB In the near future, the road traffic flow will consist of both human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Since HDVs cannot communicate with CAVs and road side units (RSU), they are unobservable to CAVs if outside the range of sensing. In such case, the advantages of CAVs will be compromised and various high-level tasks in mixed autonomous traffic flow cannot be achieved. This study proposes a model to infer HDVs information using sensing data of CAVs. The rationale is that CAVs react to HDVs based on the car-following (CF) logic. Inversely, real-time locations of HDVs can be reconstructed using the data from CAVs. The Bayesian network is used to reflect the CF logic and develop a real-time vehicle location inference method for both single and multiple CAVs scenarios. Last, the method is tested using real-world dataset. Both time consumption and near-field estimation precision are validated.

AB An investigation is conducted into thruster fault tolerant control for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in this paper. In order to reduce the steady error caused by thruster faults in the use of a traditional sliding mode controller, a fault tolerant control method integrated with thrust allocation is proposed based on the sliding mode theory. According to the proposed method, a thruster weighted matrix is introduced, whose value varies depending on the fault magnitude of the thruster. Then, the proposed controller is applied to compensate for the insufficient thrust of the fault thruster. In order to mitigate the chattering phenomenon in the sliding process, the adaptive law that applies to switching gain and the thickness of boundary layer is developed for the proposed controller. The stability of the system is demonstrated by the frame of Lyapunov theory. Finally, a series of pool-experiments on AUV prototype are conducted to validate the proposed method.

AB As a complex process, wireless optical communication of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is particularly challenging in the complex communication environment. Therefore, the existing control or denoise systems show some limitations for communication system of multi-AUV. It is still difficult to balance between the complexity of underwater environment and the performance of reality or estimation. This paper is about to investigate the possibility of combining this realistic communication environment for AUVs with existing strategies in fuzzy control framework. More specifically, first, a model for underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) is proposed, then, signal restore model for UWOC based on fuzzy control is developed for simulation and analysis purposes. To illustrate the superiority of the proposed methods, several common denoising methods are experimented and compared together. It is also shown that the fuzzy control for signal restore model can well adapt to the real communication environment, and ensure more efficiency and stabilization.

AB Terrain-aided navigation (TAN) is one of the most effective approaches for solving the long-range navigation of autonomous underwater vehicles. However, the positioning accuracy of TAN can be greatly influenced by the terrain information of matching areas. A TAN system might also fail catastrophically when the seabed topography changes. To address these problems, a dynamic path planning method for TAN, which includes environment modelling, offline path planning, and online re-planning, is proposed in this paper. Terrain standard deviation is applied to represent terrain information in environment modelling, and the Mahalanobis distance and roulette approach are introduced in the offline path planning approach. Furthermore, the topographic changes are identified and handled via an online re-planning approach. Simulation experiments are conducted, and comparisons are made with the A* algorithm. According to the experimental results, the proposed method improves the positioning accuracy of TAN during the mission, and its ability to deal with seabed topographic changes is also verified.

AB Advances in hardware technology have enabled more integration of sophisticated software, triggering progresses in development and employment of Unmanned Vehicles (UVs), and mitigating restraints for onboard intelligence. As a result, UVs can now take part in more complex mission where continuous transformation in environmental condition calls for higher level of situational responsiveness. This paper serves as an introduction to UVs mission planning and management systems aiming to highlight some of the recent developments in the field of autonomous underwater and aerial vehicles in addition to stressing some possible future directions and discussing the learned lessons. A comprehensive survey over autonomy assessment of UVs, and different aspects of autonomy such as situation awareness, cognition, and decision-making has been provided in this study. The paper separately explains the humanoid and autonomous system's performance and highlights the role and impact of a human in UVs operations.

AB The motion modeling and thruster fault reconstruction for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) system are addressed in this paper. Considering the modeling uncertainty of the AUV motion model given by dynamics analysis method, we present an AUV motion modeling method based on RBF neural networks. Since there is asymptotic convergence problem in the process of using traditional sliding mode observer to estimate the state signal, which cannot be measured directly by sensor, the fault signal cannot be reconstructed timely. Therefore, a Terminal sliding mode observer is presented to ensure each estimated state signal converge in a finite time. According to the output of Terminal sliding mode observer, the equivalent output injection method is used to reconstruct thruster fault. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated with pool experiments of the experimental prototype. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Vision-based deep learning (DL) methods have made great progress in learning autonomous driving models from large-scale crowd-sourced video datasets. They are trained to predict instantaneous driving behaviors from video data captured by on-vehicle cameras. In this paper, we develop a geo-context aware visualization system for the study of Autonomous Driving Model (ADM) predictions together with large-scale ADM video data. The visual study is seamlessly integrated with the geographical environment by combining DL model performance with geospatial visualization techniques. Model performance measures can be studied together with a set of geospatial attributes over map views. Users can also discover and compare prediction behaviors of multiple DL models in both city-wide and street-level analysis, together with road images and video contents. Therefore, the system provides a new visual exploration platform for DL model designers in autonomous driving. Use cases and domain expert evaluation show the utility and effectiveness of the visualization system.

AB Timely and accurate detection and recognition of traffic lights are critical for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) to avoid crashes due to red light running. This paper integrates a new robust machine learning based solution by combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with computer vision techniques to achieve a real-time traffic light detector. The proposed detection and recognition algorithm is capable of recognizing traffic lights on low-power small-form platforms, which are lightweight, portable, and can be mounted on AVs in daylight scenarios. The LISA open-source dataset is utilized with augmentation methods to increase the accuracy of the solution. The proposed approach achieves 93.42% of accuracy at a speed of 30.01 Frames Per Second (FPS) on an NVIDIA Jetson Xavier platform without using hardware accelerators such as FPGA. This solution is expected to promote the quicker adoption and wider deployment of AVs by increasing the chances of avoiding crashes and ultimately saving lives.

AB In this paper, a misalignment-tolerant wireless charging system based on multidimensional cross-coupling for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is proposed. The four transmitting coils of the proposed system magnetic coupler are divided evenly into two pairs as bipolar transmitting units. Subsequently, the uniform multi-dimensional horizontal magnetic flux can be obtained by two current vectors with a 90 degrees phase difference exciting in the bipolar transmitting units. For the receiver, a couple of orthogonal coils are designed to form cross-coupling with the transmitter to pick up the maximum magnetic flux. Then, the proposed magnetic coupler combined with the proposed transmitter and receiver is designed through finite element analysis. Finally, a 900 W prototype is built and tested. Experimental results show that the system has stable output characteristics in the ranges of a - 20 degrees to 20 degrees rolling misalignment and a - 30 to 30 mm axial misalignment.

AB This study investigates a formation control problem of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with unknown control directions. By employing the Nussbaum gain technique to deal with the unknown control directions, a finite-time formation control approach is proposed. To deal with the so-called 'explosion of complexity' issue in backstepping control, a compensator-based command filter technique is introduced to realise the derivative of virtual control signals. With the proposed method, the formation can be achieved within a finite settling time and all signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly bounded. The effectiveness and performance is demonstrated by numerical simulations.

AB This paper develops a novel adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller for the diving control of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Unlike most previous AUVs' control approaches, in this paper, the problem of input saturation constraint of rudder angle is considered, and the new auxiliary systems are proposed. Considering the modeling uncertainty of the dynamic model, an adaptive sliding mode controller based on fuzzy logic system is proposed, and the new update laws of control parameters are given. For the adaptive sliding mode controller design, although the input gain of each subsystem is partially known, only one fuzzy logic system is needed for online identification, which is a distinct difference from the previous adaptive sliding mode controllers. The uniformly ultimately boundedness of tracking error is proven by Lyapunov theorem. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is illustrated by simulation.

AB Following an underwater chain using an autonomous vehicle can be a first step towards more efficient solutions for cleaning and inspecting mooring chains. We propose to use sonar as a primary perception sensor to enable the vehicle operation in limited visibility conditions and overcome the possible turbidity arising during marine growth removal. Despite its advantages, working with acoustic data raises additional challenges for the processing and control methodologies involved. We present two chain link detectors that make use of forward looking sonar and multibeam data and we combine them with adequate planning and control strategies to achieve a robust framework to detect, follow and map an underwater chain. Experiments conducted in a water tank and in a real harbor environment demonstrate the capability of autonomously detecting and following a chain with sufficient accuracy to perform subsequent cleaning or inspection tasks. Besides this, we demonstrate the possibility of obtaining a preliminary map of the chain and its surroundings regardless of visibility conditions.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation and localization in underwater environments is particularly challenging due to the rapid attenuation of Global Positioning System (GPS) and radio-frequency signals. Underwater communications are low bandwidth and unreliable, and there is no access to a global positioning system. Past approaches to solve the AUV localization problem have employed expensive inertial sensors, used installed beacons in the region of interest, or required periodic surfacing of the AUV. While these methods are useful, their performance is fundamentally limited. Advances in underwater communications and the application of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology to the underwater realm have yielded new possibilities in the field. This paper presents a review of the state of the art of AUV navigation and localization, as well as a description of some of the more commonly used methods. In addition, we highlight areas of future research potential.

AB This paper focuses on the adaptive asymptotic tracking control problem for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with un-modeled dynamics and unknown input saturation by combining the backstepping control strategy and the neural network (NN) method. In our controller, a novel single neural network-based backstepping control method is proposed to address the uncertain problem, and the input saturation issue is overcome in virtue of a hyperbolic tangent function. The approximation error of the neural network is also compensated by a new adaptive mechanism in order to achieve the zero-error regulation. Furthermore, the nonlinear transformation is incorporated into the backstepping-based framework to improve the AUV performance. And then, the performance analysis illustrates that the designed controller can realize the asymptotic stability of the AUV system. Finally, the effectiveness of our control strategy is validated through simulation results.

ID SYSTEM
AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been employed in several engineering applications, such as aerial photography, environmental surveillance, delivery tasks, and others. Most of these applications have attracted increasing attention due to their ability to carry different payloads, which can change the dynamic of flight. The present article investigates the dynamics of a quadcopter with a payload mass including the stiffness of the attachment to the aerial vehicle. An approach to obtain non-dimensional equations of motion is introduced, and as a consequence, it is possible to determine the frequency of vibration of the payload mass during the flight. The results are presented for non-autonomous flight, and they establish a simple equation to estimate the oscillation frequency depending on the relation between the quadcopter and the payload masses, also considering the stiffness of attachment, without requiring a solution to the equation of motion in the time domain.

AB While vision-based localization techniques have been widely studied for small autonomous unmanned vehicles (SAUVs), sound-source localization capabilities have not been fully enabled for SAUVs. This paper presents two novel approaches for SAUVs to perform three-dimensional (3D) multi-sound-sources localization (MSSL) using only the inter-channel time difference (ICTD) signal generated by a self-rotating bi-microphone array. The proposed two approaches are based on two machine learning techniques viz., Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) and Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithms, respectively, whose performances were tested and compared in both simulations and experiments. The results show that both approaches are capable of correctly identifying the number of sound sources along with their 3D orientations in a reverberant environment.

DE Precision Agriculture; Pesticide; Autonomous Mobility
ID ROUTING PROBLEM; OPTIMIZATION
AB Sub-optimal pesticide application not only results in wastage and low yield but is also associated with harmful effects to the environment. To ensure optimal application of pesticide, a dynamic approach for pesticide management is required. Existing works do not consider the dynamic demand of pesticide and are based on static models. To solve these issues, this paper proposes a technique for the vehicle routing problem (VRP) in pesticide application. The proposed technique is based on dynamic predictive control, i.e., at each time step, the current demand is fed into a model predictive control algorithm which optimizes the vehicular assignment as well as routing to a specific area in an agricultural field. The proposed technique considers charging as well as capacity constraints for the autonomous vehicles. Simulations in MATLAB/Simulink show that the proposed technique not only resulted in at least 20% faster field coverage time but also consumed at least 22% less charge as compared to existing techniques for agricultural VRP.

AB Recently there has been increasing engineering activity in the deployment of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). Different types of AUVs are being used for applications ranging from ocean exploration to coastal tactical surveillance. These AUVs generally follow a predictable trajectory specified by the mission requirements. Inaccuracies in models for deriving position estimates and the drift caused by ocean currents, however, lead to uncertainty when estimating an AUV's position. In this article, two forms of position uncertainty - internal and external - are studied, which are the position uncertainty associated with a particular AUV as seen by itself and that as seen by others, respectively. Then, a statistical model to estimate the internal uncertainty for a general AUV is proposed. Based on this model, a novel mathematical framework using Unscented Kalman Filtering is developed to estimate the external uncertainty. Finally, the benefits of this framework for several location-sensitive applications are shown via emulations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recovering and recharging autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) on a regular basis allows for long-term underwater activities. This research provides a vision-based navigation strategy for AUVs to independently identify and reconstruct the docking station (DS). The proposed framework includes a light beacon detection approach, a filter-based light beacon matching method, and a fusion pose estimation method for DS positioning. Four green LED light beacons are mounted symmetrically on the docking ring, enabling the stereo camera to observe them from close range. A method for detecting light beacons is proposed that assures detection accuracy by identifying false positives. On a single frame from a stereo camera, filter-based matching follows the light beacons precisely. In addition, we construct a position estimate method that significantly improves accuracy and efficiency by consisting of analyzation and iteration. A series of virtual and real-world experiments demonstrate that our methodology can provide AUVs with reliable docking navigation.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES
AB This article addresses the distributed formation reconfiguration control problem for a fleet of nonlinear multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in three-dimensional (3-D) ocean environments. A novel solution to the nonplanar multi-AUV formation reconfiguration control issue is presented by using the graph rigidity and affine transformation (GR-AT) method. Firstly, all AUVs cooperatively achieve a predefined initial cube formation by using the strategy of regulating the inter-AUV distances in a rigid graph. Then the proposed GR-AT method is used to reconstruct the formation shape in multi-obstacle underwater environments. A rigorous Lyapunov stability analysis shows that these distances converge to desired values. The efficiency of the formation reconfiguration control algorithm is confirmed by a series of simulation results. Finally, the corresponding 3-D realistic experiment based on bionic robot fish is carried out to validate the feasibility of the proposed formation control.

AB For the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) platform, state quantization is a widely existing phenomenon as the result of I/O signal conversion between hardware module and control module. This article considers such an adaptive trajectory tracking control problem for AUVs with the effects of quantized state feedback and ocean disturbances. To ensure the stability of the closed-looped system under quantized states and unmeasurable ocean disturbances, a novel quantized extended state observer (QESO) is firstly proposed. Then, an adaptive anti -disturbance control scheme is developed to achieve the trajectory tracking control goal. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm paper lies in that the resulted controller is established without any usage of continuous states. Besides, rigorous stability analysis validates the uniformly ultimately boundedness of the resulting closed -loop system under quantized states. Simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithms.

AB Object segmentation is still considered a challenging problem in autonomous driving, particularly in consideration of real-world conditions. Following this line of research, this paper approaches the problem of object segmentation using LiDAR-camera fusion and semi-supervised learning implemented in a fully convolutional neural network. Our method was tested on real-world data acquired using our custom vehicle iseAuto shuttle. The data include all weather scenarios, featuring night and rainy weather. In this work, it is shown that with LiDAR-camera fusion, with only a few annotated scenarios and semi-supervised learning, it is possible to achieve robust performance on real-world data in a multi-class object segmentation problem. The performance of our algorithm was measured in terms of intersection over union, precision, recall, and area-under-the-curve average precision. Our network achieves 82% IoU in vehicle detection in day fair scenarios and 64% IoU in vehicle segmentation in night rain scenarios.

AB In recent years, autonomous vehicles have received increasing attention and many studies in the literature have discussed the potentialities and the opportunities they could offer. Despite the potential benefits, mainly related to the expected reduction in accidents and congestion phenomena as well as the potentially improved social inclusion of people with driving difficulties (e.g., people with physical disabilities or elderly people), many aspects remain to be addressed, mainly for understanding users' acceptance in the case of collective transport vehicles. This study proposes an analysis based on a survey aimed at exploring user's preferences with respect to the use of autonomous shuttles (ASs) for tourism purposes. The main correlations between the variables considered and the preferences of potential users have been discussed. Interviewees expressed high confidence in AS technology, although the analyses performed about willingness to pay show that users give more relevance to the provided transport services than the AS technology.

AB This paper experimentally evaluates various hydrodynamic damping models for streamlined tail-controlled autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). We seek damping models that can be used to accurately predict the motion of a streamlined AUV, but do not possess unnecessary complexity. Additionally, we investigate the efficacy of estimating forces and moments due to control surfaces with the same data from which damping parameters are estimated. We then directly compare the results of estimated control surface forces and moments with that obtained using high-fidelity software tools. We use an offline least-squares method and an adaptive identifier method to approximate model coefficients from data attained from field trials. Field trials were conducted using two AUVs, and the experimental results are presented. The overall goal of this paper is to determine the form of a dynamic model that can be identified from data acquired during field trials.

ID LAND-USE; CITIES; MODEL; EQUILIBRIUM; CONGESTION; IMPACTS; PARKING
AB We adapt the classic monocentric city model to consider three main topics related to the possible widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs): sprawl, energy consumption, and housing affordability. AVs are modeled to reduce marginal commuting costs and in some cases, reduce demand for center-city and residential parking. This creates opposing forces that lead to sprawl in some models and increasing density in others. All models point to welfare increases, but also increases to energy consumption due to longer commutes, greater traffic congestion, and higher productivity, calling into question claims that autonomous vehicles will save energy. In most models, AVs lead to greater housing affordability by making suburban areas more accessible, and by reclaiming land that was previously used for parking. Effects of AVs on cities are substantial and depend on the manner in which this new technology is implemented.

DT Article
AB In this paper, we study large formations of underwater autonomous vehicles for the purposes of exploration and sampling the ocean surface. The formations or aggregates we consider are composed of up to hundreds of robots with the capability of forming various complex shapes dictated by the shape of the region to be explored, as well as special shapes suitable for migration. The shapes are determined through bathymetric maps and described with reduced-dimensional representation techniques. The approach we propose is that of breaking up the control and coordination strategy into two decoupled problems, i.e., partitioning the aggregate into two non-overlapping sets: its boundary and its interior. The boundary uses general theory of curve evolution to form shapes while the interior passively complies, using attraction-repulsion forces, to form a uniform distribution inside the boundary. This makes the problem much more tractable than previous methods. Decision making by individual robots is entirely based oil local information, autonomous underwater vehicles, formation control, swarm control.

ID AVOIDANCE
AB A connected network of automated vehicles on roads can increase the driving safety of driverless vehicles (i.e., autonomous vehicles). The critical level of dangerous situations on the road while driving can be increased by the speed, orientation, and traffic density of the vehicles involved. Therefore, there is a need for a maneuvering mechanism that handles both the current driving vehicle and the oncoming vehicles headed toward an emergency zone (e.g., road hazard and road accident spot). In this paper, we present a context-aware navigation protocol (CNP) that enhances the safety of vehicles driving in urban roads. Firstly, CNP includes a collision avoidance module that builds on both vehicular networks and on-board sensors to track vehicles" behaviors, and this module analyzes the driving risks to determine the necessary maneuvers in dangerous situations. Secondly, CNP establishes a collision mitigation strategy that limits the severity of collision damages in hazardous road during non-maneuverable scenarios. We conducted a theoretical analysis as well as extensive simulations to prove and evaluate the effectiveness of CNP. The results show that CNP can reduce communication overhead from a baseline scheme by up to 60% while the risk of road collisions is less than 5%.

AB A six-wheel differential steering vehicle was designed and built to provide a vehicle platform for a greenhouse sprayer. The vehicle was designed to operate as a self-contained system, which would carry the power supply, spray tank, pump, and boom. Independently controlled DC motors were used to provide differential steering for the vehicle. A fuzzy logic-based proportional-derivative controller was developed and tested to navigate the vehicle through the aisle way using machine vision and laser radar range information. The vehicle was tested under three different path configurations using a flexible curvature track. The track was configured for straight, moderate, and heavy curved conditions. Path tracking comparisons were made between the vision-based control and a laser-radar- (ladar-) based control. The error was monitored using the ladar as the most accurate measure of the position error between the path centerline and the vehicle centerline.
   Error comparisons were made using RMS error and average instantaneous error It was found that the ladar-based control was the better overall guidance system under all track conditions. Although, average errors were fairly low at approximately 10 mm, the maximum errors left room for improvement at approximately 40 mm.

ID SCHEME; POLICY
AB Model predictive control (MPC) has been widely researched for automotive control. However, the real-world application of MPC for autonomous vehicles (AV) is still limited due to the high computational requirement of solving the real-time optimization problem. To address this issue, this letter presents an event-triggered MPC framework and illustrates its application in AV path tracking control using the CARLA simulation environment. Unlike traditional time-triggered MPC, event-triggered MPC solves the optimization problem only when an event is triggered. Otherwise, the previously optimized control sequence is used to determine control action. Therefore, when following the same path, event-triggered MPC solves fewer optimization problems than time-triggered MPC, thereby reducing the computation requirements. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, both time-triggered MPC and event-triggered MPC are simulated and compared using CARLA. Results validate that the proposed event-triggered MPC method reduces significant computation with acceptable performance degradation.

AB This paper presents the cooperative control of a team of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the presence of obstacles under environmental disturbance. A leader-follower formation control based on optimisation algorithms using communication topology is designed to navigate towards the target in the presence of obstacles. CLONAL selection optimisation algorithm may be employed as team controller by providing the optimal position to hierarchical control strategy for each AUV incorporating learning, memory and affinity. But unfortunately CLONAL selection optimisation algorithm fails to avoid obstacles because some of the lymphocytes become memory cells of the system. The above prematurity may be overcome by using artificial potential fields and ant colony optimisation technique combined with CLONAL selection optimisation algorithm. The efficacy of the proposed optimisation is verified through MATLAB simulation and the result confirmed the robustness and proficiency of proposed technique over CLONAL selection optimisation algorithm.

AB OpenStreetMaps (OSM) is currently studied as the environment representation for autonomous navigation. It provides advantages such as global consistency, a heavy-less map construction process, and a wide variety of road information publicly available. However, the location of this information is usually not very accurate locally. In this paper, we present a complete autonomous navigation pipeline using OSM information as environment representation for global planning. To avoid the flaw of local low-accuracy, we offer the novel LiDAR-based Naive-Valley-Path (NVP) method that exploits the concept of "valley" areas to infer the local path always furthest from obstacles. This behavior allows navigation always through the center of trafficable areas following the road's shape independently of OSM error. Furthermore, NVP is a naive method that is highly sample-time-efficient. This time efficiency also enables obstacle avoidance, even for dynamic objects. We demonstrate the system's robustness in our research platform BLUE, driving autonomously across the University of Alicante Scientific Park for more than 20 km with 0.24 meters of average error against the road's center with a 19.8 ms of average sample time. Our vehicle avoids static obstacles in the road and even dynamic ones, such as vehicles and pedestrians.

AB The development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is becoming increasingly important as the need for reliable and safe transportation grows. However, in order to achieve level 5 autonomy, it is crucial that such AVs can navigate through complex and unconventional scenarios. It has been observed that currently deployed AVs, like human drivers, struggle the most in cases of adverse weather conditions, unsignalized intersections, crosswalks, roundabouts, and near-accident scenarios. This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of the various navigation methodologies used in handling these situations. The paper discusses both traditional planning methods such as graph-based approaches and emerging solutions including machine-learning based approaches and other advanced decision-making and control techniques. The benefits and drawbacks of previous studies in this area are discussed in detail and it is identified that the biggest shortcomings and challenges are benchmarking, ensuring interpretability, incorporating safety as well as road user interactions, and unrealistic simplifications such as the availability of accurate and perfect perception information. Some suggestions to tackle these challenges are also presented.

AB The recent advancements in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as well as increasing demand for vehicular safety has led to significant progressions in Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology. Perception and Localisation are major operations that determine the success of AV development and usage. Therefore, significant research has been carried out to provide AVs with the capabilities to not only sense and understand their surroundings efficiently, but also provide detailed information of the environment in the form of 3D maps. Visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (V-SLAM) has been utilised to enable a vehicle understand its surroundings, map the environment, and identify its position within the area. This paper presents a detailed review of V-SLAM techniques implemented for AV perception and localisation. An overview of SLAM techniques is presented. In addition, an in-depth review is conducted to highlight various V-SLAM schemes, their strengths, and limitations. Challenges associated with V-SLAM deployment and future research directions are also provided in this paper.

AB In this article, an improved in-motion coarse alignment method is proposed for the strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) aided by the global positioning system (GPS). Traditional in-motion alignment methods suffer from complex noises contained in the outputs of inertial sensors and GPS. To solve this problem, this article proposes an in-motion coarse alignment method using the vector observation and truncated vectorized K-matrix (VO-TVK) for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The contributions of this study are twofold. Firstly, a new simplified model can be applied to the in-motion alignment process by employing the zero-trace and symmetry of the K-matrix. Secondly, the proposed VO-TVK algorithm can make up for the optimal-REQUEST algorithm's drawbacks, where the optimal-REQUEST algorithm has the conservative covariance matrix and the scalar gain. The simulation, vehicle test, and lake trial results illustrate that the proposed VO-TVK algorithm can efficiently reduce the effects of noises contained in the vector observation and achieve better accuracy than the compared algorithms.

AB We consider an optimal stopping formulation of the mission monitoring problem, in which a monitor vehicle must remain in close proximity to an autonomous robot that stochastically follows a predicted trajectory. This problem arises in a diverse range of scenarios, such as autonomous underwater vehicles supervised by surface vessels, pedestrians monitored by aerial vehicles, and animals monitored by agricultural robots. The key problem characteristics we consider are that the monitor must remain stationary while observing the robot, robot motion is modeled in general as a stochastic process, and observations are modeled as a spatial probability distribution. We propose a resolution-complete algorithm that runs in a polynomial time. The algorithm is based on a sweep-plane approach and generates a motion plan that maximizes the expected observation time and value. A variety of stochastic models may be used to represent the robot trajectory. We present results with data drawn from real AUV missions, a real pedestrian trajectory dataset and Monte Carlo simulations. Our results demonstrate the performance and behavior of our algorithm, and relevance to a variety of applications.

AB Road and sidewalk detection in urban scenarios is a challenging task because of the road imperfections and high sensor data bandwidth. Traditional free space and ground filter algorithms are not sensitive enough for small height differences. Camera-based or sensor-fusion solutions are widely used to classify drivable road from sidewalk or pavement. A LIDAR sensor contains all the necessary information from which the feature extraction can be done. Therefore, this paper focuses on LIDAR-based feature extraction. For road and sidewalk detection, the current paper presents a real-time (20 Hz+) solution. This solution can also be used for local path planning. Sidewalk edge detection is the combination of three algorithms working parallelly. To validate the result, the de facto standard benchmark dataset, KITTI, was used alongside our measurements. The data and the source code to reproduce the results are shared publicly on our GitHub repository.

AB A major role of automated vehicles is that vehicles serve as mobile sensors for event detection and data collection, which support tactical automation in autonomous driving and post-analysis for traffic safety. However, most data collected during regular operations of vehicles are not of interest, while it costs a large amount of computation, communication, and storage resources on the cloud servers. Vehicular edge computing has emerged as a promising paradigm to balance these high costs in traditional cloud computing. But edge computers often have limited resources to support the high efficiency and intelligence of advanced vehicular functions. Motivated by the existing challenges and new concepts, this paper proposes and tests a lightweight edge intelligence framework for vehicle event detection and logging that runs in an event-based and real-time manner. Specifically, this paper takes vehicle-vehicle and vehicle-pedestrian near-crashes as the events of interest. The lightweight algorithm design of modeling the bounding boxes in object detection/tracking enables real-time edge intelligence onboard a vehicle; The event-based data logging mechanism eliminates redundant data onboard and integrates multi-source information for individual near-crash events. Comprehensive open-road tests on four transit vehicles have been conducted.

AB Evaluating vehicles' energy consumption and emissions is significant to ease energy shortages and prevent environmental pollution. This study focuses on evaluating energy consumption and emissions of the mixed traffic flow with human-driven and autonomous vehicles from both economic and environmental perspectives. The proposed Green Cost Model is comprised of the energy consumption models and emissions models, taking energy recovery of electric vehicles and specific power of fuel vehicles into consideration. Based on the Energy, Eco- nomic and Environment theory, the fuel price, electricity price and carbon taxation are utilized to analyze the cost of energy usage and emissions. The feasibility and effectiveness of the Green Cost Model are verified by simulations in several typical traffic scenarios. The simulation results indicate the green cost of both fuel powered and electric vehicles. In different scenarios, the electric vehicles have less green cost than fuel vehicles, and the total green cost of the fleet decreases as the penetration of autonomous battery electric vehicles (ABEV) in- creases. In addition, lower average green cost and higher service level are obtained by taking green cost into account in the intersection timing scheme. Finally, scientific and rational policy implications are put forward for the government, drivers and automakers.

AB This study devises a novel hybrid public-transit service that uses modular autonomous vehicles (MAVs) coupled in one fleet that travels a fixed base route. MAVs can decouple from the fleet at the beginning of selected road segments and recouple to the fleet at the end of these segments. This allows a decoupled MAV to serve passengers who request door-to-door service within the deviated area, while the other passengers complete their trips via regular service. This study develops an optimisation model to determine the deviated segments, the MAVs to be decoupled and the corresponding timetable that minimises the total passenger and operator costs. Finally, a case study is conducted using real data from Dalian, China. The results show that compared with a conventional fixed-route service, the hybrid service significantly reduces the total system cost, especially passenger walking and waiting time costs..

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is one of the most important exploration tools in the ocean underwater environment, whose movement is realized by the underwater thrusters, however, the thruster fault happens frequently in engineering practice. Ocean currents perturbations could produce noise for thruster fault diagnosis, in order to solve the thruster fault diagnostics, a possibilistic fuzzy C-means (PFCM) algorithm is proposed to realize the fault classification in this paper. On the basis of the results of fault diagnostics, a fuzzy control strategy is proposed to solve the fault tolerant control for AUV. Considering the uncertainty of ocean currents, it proposes a min-max robust optimization problem to optimize the fuzzy controller, which is solved by a cooperative particle swarm optimization (CPSO) algorithm. Simulation and underwater experiments are used to verify the accuracy and feasibility of the proposed method of thruster fault diagnostics and fault tolerant control.

AB This paper studies the trajectory tracking control problem for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) subject to external disturbances and model uncertainties. To improve the tracking performance of the AUVs, a prescribed performance function is introduced to constrain the output tracking error. Then, a fixed-time extended state observer (FxTESO) is set up to estimate the unknown states and the lumped disturbances (including external disturbances and model uncertainties). With the outputs of the FxTESO, a novel dynamic fixed-time terminal sliding mode (FxTTSM) surface is constructed and then a fixed-time output feedback controller is designed to achieve trajectory tracking control for the AUVs. By employing Lyapunov function theory, the stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the developed control scheme.

AB To achieve anti-crosswind, anti-sideslip, and anti-rollover in trajectory-tracking for Four-Wheel Steering (4WS) autonomous vehicles, a trajectory-tracking controller based on a four-channel Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) was used to track the desired lateral displacement, longitudinal displacement, yaw angle, and roll angle, and minimize the tracking errors between the actual output values and the desired values through static decoupling steering and braking systems. In addition, the anti-crosswind, anti-sideslip, and anti-rollover simulations were implemented with CarSim (R). Finally, the simulation results showed that the 4WS autonomous vehicle with the controller still has good anti-crosswind, anti-sideslip, and anti-rollover performance in path tracking, even under a small turning radius or low-adhesion curved roads.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are poised to take over the automotive market. This study examines capabilities to reduce material handling systems and to increase the flexibility and changeability provided by AVs' self-driving function during assembly. We combine a literature review with a set of twenty-six interviews with experts and a cross-case study of three automotive manufacturers to identify (1) the minimum functional requirements of manufacturing driving readiness (MDR), i.e., self-driving unfinished AVs in factories, (2) the parts and processes needed to meet the requirements, (3) the changes required in the assembly sequence and (4) the resulting requirements for automotive design. One main finding is that automotive industry could reach MDR after an as-sembly state of 60% without major design changes. Our results will affect decision-makers in assembly engineering, automotive designers and researchers of automotive assembly systems and innovations.

AB This paper addresses the dynamics modeling and typical motion analysis of a highly-maneuverable multi-joint autonomous underwater vehicle (MJ-AUV) for deep-sea exploration. A generalized recursive dynamics modeling method is proposed based on the Newton-Euler dynamics equation and its derivation process is provided. The kinematic model is established through the screw theory and the product of exponentials (PoE) formula. A detailed dynamics model is obtained by analyzing the force states of the MJ-AUV and computing the hydro-dynamic coefficients based on the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. Three typical motion modes, i. e., spiral, vertical profile, and cruise motion, are selected to investigate the motion performance of the MJ-AUV via simulations and sea/lake experiments based on the detailed dynamics model. The experimental and simu-lation results demonstrate that the MJ-AUV has good maneuverability and can resist external disturbances, which validate the effectiveness of the proposed dynamics model.

AB This paper proposes an adaptive backstepping sliding mode control (ABSMC) scheme for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) subject to the dynamic uncertainty, external disturbance and quantization error. The control input signals including control forces and moment are quantized by a hybrid quantizer which is the combinination of a logarithmic quantizer and a uniform quantizer. The kinematic controller is designed by the backstepping control technique and the dynamic controller is developed using the sliding mode control method. In order to further improve the robustness of the closed-loop system, an adaptive law is employed to estimate the upper bound of the total uncertainties in real time. The stability of the closed-loop system is proved based on the Lyapunov theory and indicates that the proposed control method can force the AUV to track the desired trajectory. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

To accomplish this algorithm, obstacle avoidance rules are planned, and the RRA processes are split into five steps Introduction only lists 4 so AUVs can rapidly respond to various environment obstacles. The largest polar angle algorithm (LPAA) is designed to change detected obstacle's irregular outline into a convex polygon, which simplifies the obstacle avoidance process. A solution is designed to solve the trapping problem existing in U-shape obstacle avoidance by an outline memory algorithm. Finally, simulations in three unknown obstacle scenes are carried out to demonstrate the performance of this algorithm, where the obtained obstacle avoidance trajectories are safety, smooth and near-optimal.

AB For investigating driver characteristic as well as control authority allocation during the process of human-vehicle shared control (HVSC) for an autonomous vehicle (AV), a HVSC dynamic mode with a driver's neuromuscular (NMS) state parameters was proposed in this paper. It takes into account the driver's NMS characteristics such as stretch reflection and reflex stiffness. By designing a model predictive control (MPC) controller, the vehicle's state feedback and driver's state are incorporated to construct the HVSC dynamic model. For the validation of the model, a field experiment was conducted. The vehicle state signals are collected by V-BOX, and the driver's state signals are obtained with the electromyography instrument. Subsequently, the hierarchical least square (HLS) parameter identification algorithm was implemented to identify the parameters of the model based on the experimental results. Moreover, the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) was utilized to estimate the important NMS parameters which cannot be measured directly. The experimental results showed that the model we proposed has excellent accuracy in characterizing the vehicle's dynamic state and estimating the driver's NMS parameter. This paper will serve as a theoretical basis for the new control strategy allocation between human and vehicle for L3 class AVs.

AB Personal mobility is facing three major innovations that have disruptive potential: electrification, shared mobility and automation. In this perspective I present each of these on their own and look at their role in disrupting the auto industry, the transport system and energy system. The largest disruptive potential lies in the combination of these three innovations, i.e., in the shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEV). While shared mobility per se might not have the potential to truly disrupt the transport system it is necessary to steer electrification and automation in a more sustainable direction. Technology and innovations alone will not be sufficient to create a new sustainable transportation system, regulations will also be necessary.

AB This work develops a control system for the waypoint-tracking of a biornimetic autonomous underwater vehicle (BAUV). The BAUV swims forward by oscillating its body and caudal fin, It turns by bending its body and caudal fin toward the turning direction. The control algorithm uses the oscillating frequency to control the forward velocity, and applies a body-spline offset parameter to control the heading velocity. The motion of the BAUV is undulatory, so moving averages of swimming velocity and heading errors are used as feedback signals. The stability of the control system is discussed using a Lyapunov function. Finally, the effectiveness of the control algorithm is experimentally confirmed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We introduce a mathematical model for the study of cooperative control problems for multiple autonomous air vehicles (AAVs) connected via a communication network. We propose a cooperative control strategy based on task-load balancing that see to ensure that no vehicle is underutilized and we show how to characterize task-load balancing as a stability property. Then, using Lyapunov stability analysis, we provide conditions under which task-load balancing is achieved even in the presence of communication delays. Finally, we investigate performance properties of the cooperative controller using Monte Carlo simulations. This shows the benefits of cooperation and the effects of network delays and communication topology on performance.

Qualitative deductions were made concerning the effect of geometric variations. Then the added mass coefficients for several configurations of body geometry were generated for the Canadian Self-Contained Off-the-shelf Underwater Testbed (C-SCOUT) vehicle using the computer program Estimate Submarine Added Mass (ESAM). The changes in the added mass coefficients have direct relationships to the varied parameter.

AB Driverless cars and autonomous vehicles have significantly changed the face of transportation those days. Efficient use of vision system in the recent development of advanced driver assistance systems since last two decades have equipped cars and light vehicles to reduce accidents, congestion, crashes and pollution. The robust performance of the driver assistance systems absolutely depend on the flawless detection of the vehicles from the images. Developments of vigorous computer vision techniques based on various Image level features have enabled intelligent Transportation systems to solve some of the core challenges in vehicle detection. A detailed study of the vehicle detection in dynamic conditions is presented in this paper. The complexity of the vehicle detection in variable on-road driving conditions is evident from the diverse challenges illustrated in this paper. Dynamic vehicle detection mechanism has obviously attracted numerous approaches like feature based techniques and model based techniques. Different set of visual information representation as edge, shadow, light are used to detect the vehicles. Out of all low level features shape representation for vehicle detection is observed more efficient. The need of handling massive visual data for processing is addressed using novel feature representation like object proposal methods is discussed in more detail. The efficacy of ongoing research in Autonomous vehicles is validated using deep learning techniques on aerial image analysis.

AB The motion planning problem of a single autonomous vehicle having a minimum turn radius constraint, visiting an ordered sequence of targets in an environment with polygonal obstacles, is addressed. Two types of vehicles are considered: aerial/ground vehicle - described by the Dubins/Reeds-Shepp vehicle models, respectively. The problem is posed in the form of a search tree by using the obstacles' vertices, vehicle's initial configuration, and the set of target points as nodes. The tree's arcs are represented by the Dubins/Reed-Shepp paths without terminal angle constraint (relaxed paths) connecting two adjacent nodes. These relaxed paths - connecting an initial configuration and a destination, are calculated using a feedback algorithm. Due to the computational complexity of the problem a genetic algorithm is proposed. Additionally, two deterministic search algorithms are presented. A quick heuristic greedy algorithm which uses the visibility graph distances for estimating the remaining vehicle path and an exhaustive algorithm which provides optimal solution trajectories. The performance of the algorithms is demonstrated and compared through sample runs and a Monte Carlo study. Results confirm that the heuristic algorithm provides relatively good solution for a small radius turn vehicle, while the genetic algorithm offers a good trade-off between computational load and performance.

AB This article proposes an adaptive nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode control scheme with piecewise fast multi-power reaching law for tracking control of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles under model uncertainties, ocean disturbances, and measurement noise. This control approach enhances the robustness and guarantees faster convergence of state error to zero in finite time while reducing the chattering effect. Utilizing the benefit of adaption law prevents overestimating control parameters, and it eliminates the need for the upper bound value of disturbances. The overall stability of the system is analyzed using the Lyapunov criterion. The results of the proposed approach are compared with adaptive nonsingular terminal sliding mode control and adaptive sliding mode control. The performance of the proposed control approach is evaluated by using the performance indices root mean square error and chattering indicator. The simulation results confirm the efficiency of the proposed approach.

AB We present a general multi-scale approach for modeling the interaction of controlled autonomous vehicles (AVs) with the surrounding traffic flow. The model consists of a scalar conservation law for the bulk traffic, coupled with ordinary differential equations describing the possibly interacting AV trajectories. The coupling is realized through flux constraints at the moving bottleneck positions, inducing the formation of non-classical jump discontinuities in the traffic density. In turn, AVs are forced to adapt their speed to the downstream traffic average velocity in congested situations. We analyze the model solutions in a Riemann-type setting, and propose an adapted finite volume scheme to compute approximate solutions for general initial data. The work paves the way to the study of general optimal control strategies for AV velocities, aiming at improving the overall traffic flow by reducing congestion phenomena and the associated externalities.

First, a risk assessment model, Safety Field, combined with field theory and kinematics model was defined considering the passengers' subjective feelings to identify the long-term safety trends. Based on the safety field, a new planning algorithm named S algorithm was developed, which was inspired by the A* algorithm. The special grid map, the lists, and the evaluation function designed in the S algorithm enabling its application to complex dynamic situations while considering riding safety and riding comfort. And the proposed path planning method has good scalability that we extend its application scenarios from straight roads to curved roads. Finally, the S algorithm was validated in virtual traffic environments on straight and curved roads, and the results from the test cases demonstrated the effectiveness and scalability of the algorithm.

AB Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have become a popular method for enhancing transportation safety and efficiency. As essential participants of ITS, autonomous vehicles need to detect pedestrians accurately. In this paper, we propose a one-stage anchor-free pedestrian detection model named Bi-Center Network (BCNet), which is aided by the semantic features of pedestrians' visible parts. We perform an ablation study to discover how visibility features could benefit the detector's performance, including introducing two hyper-parameters and adopting three different attention mechanisms, respectively. The experimental results indicate that the performance of pedestrian detection could be significantly improved, since the visibility semantic could prompt stronger responses on the heatmap. We compare our BCNet variants with state-of-the-art models on the CityPersons dataset and ETH dataset; results indicate that our detector is effective and achieves a promising performance.

TI Autonomous underwater vehicles: Trends and transformations
SO MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Three examples of inter-agency cooperation utilizing current generation, individual Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are described consistent with recent recommendations of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy. The first steps in transforming individual AUVs into adaptive, networked systems are underway. To realize an affordable and deployable system, a network-class AUV must be designed with cost-size constraints not necessarily applied in developing solo AUVs. Vehicle types are suggested based on function and ocean operating regime: surface layer, interior and bottom layer. Implications for platform, navigation and control subsystems are explored and practical formulations for autonomy and intelligence are postulated for comparing performance and judging behavior. Laws and conventions governing intelligent maritime navigation are reviewed and an autonomous controller with conventional collision avoidance behavior is described. Network-class cost constraints can be achieved through economies of scale. Productivity and efficiency in AUV manufacturing will increase if constructive competition is maintained. Constructive strategies include interface and operating standards. Professional societies and industry trade groups have a leadership role to play in establishing public, open standards.

AB This paper investigates the yaw angle tracking control of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) subject to fully unknown internal dynamic, external disturbance, and unknown control input gain. A model-free adaptive anti-disturbance autopilot control method is proposed for an ASV without using any model parameters. Specifically, by utilizing real-time and historical data, data-driven concurrent learning extended state observer (CLESO) is designed to estimate the unknown ASV model parameters and ensure the convergence of the estimation without requiring persistent excitation. Then, a model-free yaw angle tracking controller is designed based on the data-driven CLESO. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, the closed-loop system is proven to be input-to-state stable (ISS). Simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed CLESO for the yaw angle tracking of an ASV with fully unknown dynamic model.

AB In this paper we examine how the rise of Autonomous Vehicles (AV) is reshaping the power dynamics in the automobile industry through competition from the information technology (IT) industry. By introducing the concept of market capture, we analyze how incumbents and newcomers pursue control over the definition, evolution, and technology of a newly emerging market. We demonstrate this with an analysis of technological acquisitions and alliance networks for 2011-2018, a period where the AV industry first coalesced and then experienced dramatic growth. By examining firm transactions through their geographic locations and an array of centrality measures, we shed light on inter-firm dynamics shaping the emergence and evolution of the AV industry. This research demonstrates how market capture can serve as a useful framework to analyze competition, cooperation, geographic patterns, and power asymmetries in the transaction network of an emerging industry.

AB Mobility as a service (MaaS) is proposed to encourage travelers to choose sustainable mobility options and reduce use of individual car. In the future, mobility services based on autonomous vehicles (AVs) are also incorporated into MaaS. The objective of our work is to elaborate the concept of mobile application, aiding the MaaS based on AVs. We applied a system engineering process-oriented approach to determine the information system components, the functions as well as input and output data. Functions of back-end information system operation and front-end interface of application have been identified, as well as the information flows have been modeled. We highlighted the main differences between MaaS and MaaS based on AVs. We found that recording of event-based points and feedback management are regarded as pivot functions in this self-travel service. Our results facilitate the development of smartphone application for the MaaS based on AVs.

AB The autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) can save human life from severe environments and reduce the operating cost of underwater equipment. Generally, the hulls of AUVs are made of composite materials or metal alloys, such as aluminum alloy and titanium alloy. Composite materials have the following attractive properties: light weight, corrosion resistance and freedom of shape design. However, composite materials do not undergo plastic deformation well, which can be a disadvantage if these materials are used for underwater equipment. For this reason, this study focused on the reliability of composite material. This paper reports the material design, experiment for materials and verification by FEA. Two types of Al-CFRP hybrid composites were used: co-cured and post-bonded material. Tensile and interlaminar tests were performed to define the material properties. Mechanical tests of designed materials were carried out and the results were used for FEA. This study confirmed the feasibility of Al-CFRP hybrid composites for AUVs.

AB The commercial adoption of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and the positive impact they are expected to have on traffic safety depends on appropriate insurance products due to the high potential losses. A significant proportion of these losses are expected to occur from the out-of-distribution risks which arise from situations outside the AV's training experience. Traditional vehicle insurance products (for human-driven vehicles) rely on large data sets of drivers' background and historical incidents. However, the lack of such datasets for AVs makes it imperative to exploit the ability to deploy AVs in simulated environments. In this paper, the data collected by deploying Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) in simulated environments is used to develop models to answer two questions: (1) how risky a road Section is for an AV to drive? and (2) how does the risk profile vary with different (SAE levels) of ADSs? A simulation pipeline was built on the CARLA (Car Learning to Act): an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. The environment was specified using parameters such as weather, lighting, traffic density, traffic flow, no. of lanes, etc. A metric - risk factor was defined as a combination of harsh accelerations/braking, inverse Time to Collision, and inverse Time Headway to capture the crashes and near-crashes. To assess the difference between ADSs, two ADSs: OpenPilot (Level 2/3) and Pylot (Level 4) were implemented in the simulator. The results (from data and model predictions) show that the trends in the relation between the environment features and risk factor for an AV are similar to those observed for human drivers (e.g., risk increases with traffic flow). The models also showed that junctions were a risk hot-spot for both ADSs. The feature importance of the model revealed that the Level 2/3 ADS is more sensitive to no. of lanes and the Level 4 ADS is sensitive to traffic flow. Such differences in feature importance provide valuable insights into the risk characteristics of different ADSs. In the future, this base model will be extended to include other features (other than the environment), e.g., take over requests, and also address the deficiencies of the current simulation data in terms of insensitivity to weather and lighting.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Purpose The purpose is to create an algorithm that optimizes the trajectories that an autonomous vehicle must follow to reduce its energy consumption and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.
   Design/methodology/approach An algorithm is presented that respects the dynamic constraints of the robot, including the characteristics of power delivery by the motor, the behaviour of the tires and the basic inertial parameters. Using quadratic sequential programming with distributed and non-monotonous search direction (Quadratic Programming Algorithm with Distributed and Non-Monotone Line Search), an optimization algorithm proposed and developed by Professor K. Schittkowski is implemented.
   Findings Relations between important operating variables have been obtained, such as the evolution of the autonomous vehicle's velocity, the driving torque supplied by the engine and the forces acting on the tires. In a subsequent analysis, the aim is to analyse the relationship between trajectory made and energy consumed and calculate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Also this method has been checked against another different methodology commented on in the references.
   Research limitations/implications The main limitation comes from the modelling that has been done. As greater is the mechanical systems analysed, more simplifying hypotheses should be introduced to solve the corresponding equations with the current computers. However, the solutions are obtained and they can be used qualitatively to draw conclusions.
   Practical implications One main objective is to obtain guidelines to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by reducing energy consumption in the realization of autonomous vehicles' trajectories. The first step to achieve that is to obtain a good model of the autonomous vehicle that takes into account not only its kinematics but also its dynamic properties, and to propose an optimization process that allows to minimize the energy consumed. In this paper, important relationships between work variables have been obtained.
   Social implications The idea is to be friendly with nature and the environment. This algorithm can help by reducing an instance of greenhouse gases.
   Originality/value Originality comes from the fact that we not only look for the autonomous vehicle's modelling, the simulation of its motion and the analysis of its working parameters, but also try to obtain from its working those guidelines that are useful to reduce the energy consumed and the contamination capability of these autonomous vehicles or car-like robots.

AB AUTO ACCIDENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE for 1.3 million deaths annually, according to the World Health Organization. That's like losing the city of Prague each year. A switch to self-driving cars and trucks with various types of electronic sensors and sophisticated computers at the helm could save countless lives. But getting this promising technology into people's hands has been difficult, despite massive research investments and considerable technical progress. So when will self-driving cars really come to a driveway near you? The answer depends in part on whether such cars require a type of sensor called lidar, short for "light detection and ranging." Most groups developing autonomous vehicles see lidar as a critical part of the sensor suite required for safe operation, because it allows a detailed 3D map of the vehicle's environment to be constructed with much more fidelity than can be done with cameras.

AB IMU fault diagnosis and information reconstruction are important to the safety of the autonomous underwater vehicle. To improve the fault tolerance of AUV to IMU faults, an IMU fault diagnosis and information reconstruction method based on the analytical redundancy is proposed in this paper. First, the IMU analytical method is constructed with the help of the autonomous underwater vehicle kinematic model, and the analytical relationship between IMU signal and innovation is given. Next, the t-test method and decoupling matrix method are designed to get fault diagnosis results for gyroscopes and accelerometers. Furthermore, the IMU fault estimation method based on innovation has been designed to estimate IMU faults and realize IMU signal reconstruction. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method, showing its feasibility for IMU faults.

AB Stereo vision systems in autonomous vehicles can come with camera sensors with different models and lenses to detect objects at long and short ranges. The intrinsic/extrinsic parameters of the camera sensors, such as the focal length and distortion parameters used for calibration, are not provided. In this article, we present a novel rectification method for uncalibrated stereo cameras based on their corresponding feature points. To obtain reliable key/feature points and descriptors from stereo images, we propose a deep neural network, called a multilevel feature pooling network. The model processes images individually to learn both local and semiglobal features, from which the location and descriptor of each pixel in the image are estimated. We also introduce a method to balance the zoom effect caused by the different focal lengths of the camera lenses and rectify the images by estimating homography matrices for stereo images based on their refined corresponding feature points.

AB Machine learning and computational processing have advanced such that automated driving systems (ADSs) are no longer a distant reality. Many automobile manufacturers have developed prototypes; however, there exist numerous decision support issues requiring resolution to ensure mass ADS adoption. In the coming decades, it is likely that production ADSs will only be partially autonomous. Such ADSs operate within predetermined conditions and require driver intervention when they are violated. Since forecasts of their 20-year market penetration are relatively low, ADSs will likely operate in heterogeneous traffic characterized by vehicles of varying autonomy levels. Under these conditions, effective decision support must consider intangible, subjective, and emotional factors as well as influences of human cognition; otherwise, the ADS risks driver distrust and unsatisfactory performance based on an incomplete understanding of its environment. We survey the literature relevant to these issues, identify open problems, and propose research directions for their resolution.

AB This paper reports our progress on the development of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) docking system based on optical guidance. The configuration of the docking system is introduced. A dock that carries a circular light emitter is designed to give guidance. The AUV we developed is equipped with an optical system to detect the light from the dock. As compared with vision-based scheme, the tracking system is simple and effective. The behavior of the optical sensor in the light field is thoroughly analyzed in this paper. A closed loop control scheme is developed. Experiment results verified the effectiveness of the docking system. An improved control algorithm based on depth error compensation is also proposed in this paper so as to improve the robustness and adaptiveness of the docking system. Preliminary results show the feasibility of the improvements; the AUV can get into the dock even under some adverse initial conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Road accidents cause a large number of public fatalities in developing countries affecting them economically. It has been more than a decade since automobile industries are into developing intelligent vehicles with a major objective of road safety. In order to warn or assist the drivers, various automobile manufacturers have been focusing on developing autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, but not much effort has been drawn towards developing the smart infrastructure to supplement the development of intelligent vehicles. This paper proposes a framework for a smart vehicle monitoring system to provide smooth mobility of vehicles using roadside units such as streetlights. Such a system aims to eliminate the necessity of equipping each vehicle with smart sensors, which is typically an expensive scheme in most of the developing and underdeveloped countries around the world. This paper attempts to approach the problem of vehicle collision prediction by designing the system based on the concepts from science and engineering such as relative motion and vectors and implementing it using a machine learning-based model. These concepts led to the generation of datasets over which the prediction model was trained. The performance of the proposed model has been simulated using the software - Virtual Crash.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have been used extensively in deep sea research, The AUVs are preferred to remote operated vehicles (ROVs) due to their low cost and efficiency. Failure detection and control is an important issue in maintaining the stability of an AUV. In most AUVs, the vehicle resurfaces in the event of minor failures such as in the depth sensor, the inclinometer, etc. This paper proposes an intelligent system for failure detection and control in AUVs where the vehicle could continue exploration in case of minor failures in the sensors and control surfaces. The intelligent system, based on the model proposed in [12], integrates the adaptability of an artificial neural network (ANN) and the inferencing ability of a fuzzy rule based expert system on a single VLSI chip. The associative function of the ANN is used to recognize and detect the failures by observing the various changing parameters of the dynamic vehicle. The inferencing ability of an expert system suggests ways to control the failure and indicates the subsequent status of the vehicle. The entire system could be used as a low level diagnoser in an overall control system for AUVs.

AB This article presents a robust nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme for autonomous navigation of underwater robotic vehicles operating in a constrained workspace including the static obstacles. In particular, the purpose of the controller is to guide the vehicle toward specific way points with guaranteed input and state constraints. Various constraints, such as obstacles, workspace boundaries, predefined upper bounds for the velocity of the robotic vehicle, and thruster saturations, are considered during the control design. Moreover, the proposed control scheme is designed at dynamic level, and it incorporates the full dynamics of the vehicle in which the ocean currents are also involved. Hence, taking the thrusts as the control inputs of the robotic system and formulating them accordingly, the vehicle exploits the ocean current dynamics when these are in favor of the way-point tracking mission, resulting in reduced energy consumption by the thrusters. The robustness of the closed-loop system against parameter uncertainties has been analytically guaranteed with convergence properties. The performance of the proposed control strategy is experimentally verified using a 4 degrees of freedom (DoF) underwater robotic vehicle inside a constrained test tank with sparse static obstacles.

AB Urban commuters have been suffering from traffic congestion for a long time. In order to avoid or mitigate the congestion effect, it is significant to know how the introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs) influence the road capacity . The effects that AVs bring to the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) were investigated through microscopic traffic simulations. This is a key issue as the MFD is a basic model to describe road capacity in practical traffic engineering. Accordingly, the paper investigates how the different percentage of AVs affects the urban MFD. A detailed simulation study was carried out by using SUMO both with an artificial grid road network and a real-world network in Budapest. On the one hand, simulations clearly show the capacity improvement along with AVs penetration growth. On the other hand, the paper introduces an efficient modeling for MFDs with different AVs rates by using the generalized additive model (GAM).

AB In order to realize recovery of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), the L-shaped light array installed at the bottom of the fork-carrying-pole docking device is designed, and the visual positioning algorithm based on the L-shaped light array is proposed. The L-shaped light array is identified by a camera installed on the abdomen of the AUV, the relative position deviation from the AUV and the light array is calculated, and the AUV is docked according to the obtained positional deviation. The monocular four-degree-of-freedom positioning algorithm for AUV solves the problem of missing part of the target light source. Judging the heading angle is improved when the AUV has a longitudinal inclination (heeling angle). The docking experiment of AUV recovery is carried out to verify the feasibility of the L-shaped light array as visual guidance and the stability of the positioning algorithm.

AB In recent years, there have been plenty of demands and growth in the autonomous vehicle industry, and thus, challenges of designing highly efficient photonic radars that can detect and range any target with the resolution of a few centimeters have been encountered. The existing radar technology is unable to meet such requirements due to limitations on available bandwidth. Another issue is to consider strong attenuation while working under diverse atmospheric conditions at higher frequencies. The proposed model of photonic radar is developed considering these requirements and challenges using the frequency-modulated direct detection technique and considering a free-space range of 750 m. The result depicts improved range detection in terms of received power and an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio and range under adverse climatic situations.

AB The autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is mainly used in the development and exploration of the ocean. As an important module of the AUV, the actuator plays an important role in the normal execution of the AUV. Therefore, the fault diagnosis of the actuator is particularly important. At present, the research on the strong faults, such as the winding of the actuator, has achieved good results, but the research on the weak fault diagnosis is relatively rare. In this paper, the tri-stable stochastic resonance model is analyzed, and the ant colony tri-stable stochastic resonance model is used to diagnose the weak fault. The system accurately diagnoses the fault of the actuator collision and verifies the adaptive tri-stable stochastic resonance system. This model has better diagnostic results than the bi-stable stochastic resonance system.

AB This paper presents control design and nonlinear stability analysis for path-following of an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), with dynamics restricted to the longitudinal plane. For this AUV motion control system, the speed of translational dynamics is much slower than that of orientation dynamics. Such characteristic allows for a mathematical setup which can be naturally treated by standard singular perturbation theory. Based on this analysis, a simple control law is designed with time scale decomposition method, which is able to stabilize an AUV to desired diving path by selecting desired collective pitch rate and pitch angle. Its nonlinear stability analysis is performed by constructing Lyapunov functions, in term of singular perturbation method. The paper also proves that the control law is robust in the presence of bounded disturbances and model uncertainties, using the small-gain theorem. Furthermore, simulation results are presented to illustrate the control performance.

TI Isotherm Tracking by an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle in Drift Mode
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV); isotherm; drift; tracking
AB Studies of marine physical, chemical, and microbiological processes benefit from observing in a Lagrangian frame of reference. Some of these processes are related to specific density or temperature ranges. We have developed a method for a Tethys-class long-range autonomous underwater vehicle (LRAUV) (which has a propeller and a buoyancy engine) to track a targeted isothermal layer (within a narrow temperature range) in a stratified water column when operating in buoyancy-controlled drift mode. In this mode, the vehicle shuts off its propeller and autonomously detects the isotherm and stays with it by actively controlling the vehicle's buoyancy. The LRAUV starts on an initial descent to search for the target temperature. Once the temperature falls in the target center bracket, the vehicle records the corresponding depth and adjusts buoyancy to hold that depth. As long as the temperature stays within a tolerance range, the vehicle continues to hold that depth. If the temperature falls out of the tolerance range, the vehicle will increase or decrease buoyancy to reacquire the target temperature and track it. In a June 2015 experiment in Monterey Bay, CA, USA, an LRAUV ran the presented algorithm to successfully track a target isotherm for 13 h. Over the isotherm tracking duration, the LRAUV mostly remained in the 0.5 degrees C (peak-to-peak) tolerance range as designed, even though the water column's stratification kept changing. This work paves the way to coupling an LRAUV's complimentary modes of flight and drift-searching for an oceanographic feature in flight mode, and then switching to drift mode to track the feature in a Lagrangian frame of reference.

AB Lane keeping systems for a keeping a vehicle in the desired lane is key to advanced driving assistance system in autonomous vehicles. This paper presents a cost-effective image sensor with efficient processing algorithm for lane detection and lane control applications to autonomous delivery systems. The algorithm includes (1) lane detection by inverse perspective mapping and random sample consensus parabola fitting and (2) lane control by pure pursuit steering controller and classical proportional integral speed controller based on a nonholonomic kinematic model. The image sensor experiments conducted on a 1/10 scale model car maneuvering in a straight-curve-straight lane validate the better processing performance before, during, and after the turning section over previous work. The image sensor with the processing algorithm achieves the average lane detection error within 5% and maximum cross-track error within 9% in real-time. The development shall pave the way to cost-effective autonomous delivery systems.

AB The control problem of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is a very challenging one since the mathematical model of AUV is characterized by high nonlinearity, strongly coupling and time-varying features. In this paper, our aim is to design a diving active disturbance rejection controller for AUV. Firstly, a mathematical model of AUV is established, and the mathematical model is subsequently decoupled into three subsystems including speed control model, diving control model and steering control model. Then, an improved tracking differentiator is employed, which can provide better noise attenuation performance and avoid the chattering phenomenon as compared to the traditional tracking differentiator. After that, the controller is designed by using the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) with the improved tracking differentiator. Finally, simulations are given to shown the effectiveness of the developed control scheme. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Vehicular ad hoc network and cooperative adaptive cruise control system make vehicle platooning with small headway feasible. In the study of the autonomous vehicle platoon system under the vehicular ad hoc network condition, the linear vehicle model is usually used to analyze the minimum space-gap, safety space-gap, and so on. However, the stability of nonlinear vehicle system shows that there are limitations when using the linearized vehicle model to analyze vehicle stability. The linear model cannot reflect the influence of the system nonlinear coupling on the vehicle stability. Therefore, in this paper, we use the validated 5-degree-of-freedom (longitudinal velocity, lateral velocity, yaw rate, front wheel rotational velocity, and rear wheel rotational velocity) nonlinear model to analyze the stable intra-platoon spacing of the autonomous vehicle platoon system under the condition of VANET. In order to study the safety intra-platoon spacing of vehicle platoon running in the complex path, a following controller is designed for vehicle platoon running in the corners. The controller adopts the method of vertical and horizontal decentralized control. The longitudinal control is to realize the expected space-gap of vehicles in vehicle platoon, and the lateral control is to achieve the position and orientation following of the preceding vehicle. Based on the stability verification of the following controller, the following control characteristics of vehicle system are analyzed, and the stable headway required for vehicles in vehicle platoon running in the complex path is predicted by the method of simulation experiment.

Specifically, GTMPC constantly establishes and solves Stackelberg games corresponding to multiple game candidate vehicles (GCV) within the game scope when SV is able to interact with GCVs by signaling a lane change intention through turn signal. GTMPC first selects one target vehicle (TV) within multiple GCVs based on the Stackelberg equilibrium, followed by estimating TV's aggressiveness based on the interaction between SV and TV, then completes the maneuver through MPC. GTMPC performance is compared with level-k game theoretic controller. Human-in-the-Loop results showed that GTMPC is capable to safely complete the MLC by properly assessing the aggressiveness of surrounding vehicles, driven either by intelligent driver model or human drivers.

AB The advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has gained increasing attention in China. Although auto manufacturers and innovators have attempted to confirm that AVs are safe and have introduced them on public roads, it is vital to understand end-users' acceptance of AVs. A total of 1453 participants voluntarily and validly completed a series of questionnaires. The questionnaires included the Autonomous Vehicle Acceptability Scale (AVAS), the Traffic Climate Scale (TCS), and sociodemographic variables. The satisfactory internal consistency reliability and construct validity revealed that the newly developed Chinese version of the AVAS is a suitable tool to measure public acceptance of AVs. Moreover, exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis conformed to the four factors of AVAS, including benefits in usefulness (BIU), benefits in situations (BIS), concern scenarios (CS) and system concern (SC). Scores higher on benefits and lower on concerns represent more acceptance of AVs. In addition, we found that the public's perceived local traffic safety climate affected the attitude toward AVs. More specifically, external affective demands (EAD) were found to be a significant predictor of SC, internal requirements (IR) were shown to have an effect on BIS and CS, and functionality was found to be a significant predictor of BIU and SC. Furthermore, the differences between drivers and non-drivers revealed that drivers were concerned significantly less about AVs and regarded AVs as more useful than non-drivers did. To gain more customers for the purchase of AVs, it is necessary for automotive vehicle manufacturers and retailers to introduce and advertise the functions and usability of autonomous driving systems to the public. Gaining acceptance from end users and understanding the factors that affect acceptability will be critical to the widespread deployment of AVs.

ID PREDICTIVE CONTROL
AB In this paper, we propose a game-based coupling controller to solve the problem of autonomous vehicles in the trajectory tracking process. The controller ensures path tracking accuracy and shows good tracking performance for the desired speed profile that changes based on navigation while driving. Furthermore, it improves ride comfort and addresses the lateral stability problems that occur when applying classical model predictive control (MPC) controllers. We implemented this controller to plan the trajectory by considering the fundamental interaction between longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics, as well as to track the trajectory by using a receding horizon strategy. A comparative study was conducted to compare the proposed controller with the classical MPC controller. Based on CarMaker-Matlab/Simulink co-simulations, this controller outperformed the classical MPC in terms of trajectory tracking performance. Moreover, it exhibits excellent ride comfort and lateral stability that passengers will experience.

AB There are multifarious stationary vehicles in urban driving environments. Autonomous vehicles need to make appropriate overtaking maneuver decisions to navigate through the stationary vehicles. In literature, overtaking maneuver decision problems have been addressed in the perspective of either discretionary lane-change or parked vehicle classification. While the former approaches are prone to generating undesired overtaking maneuvers in urban traffic scenarios, the latter approaches induce deadlock situations behind a stationary vehicle which is not distinctly classified as a parked vehicle. To overcome the limitations, we analyzed the significant decision factors in the traffic scenes and designed a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model to make human-like overtaking maneuver decisions. The significant traffic-related and intention-related decision factors were harmoniously extracted in the traffic scene interpretation process and were utilized as the inputs of the model to generate overtaking maneuver decisions in the same manner with the human driver. The overall validation results convinced that the extracted decision factors contributed to increasing the learning performance of the model, and consequently, the proposed decision-making system enabled the autonomous vehicles to generate more human-like overtaking maneuver decisions in various urban traffic scenarios.</p>

AB This paper focuses on the economic feasibility of applying autonomous robotic vehicles compared to conventional systems in three different applications: robotic weeding in high value crops (particularly sugar beet), crop scouting in cereals and grass cutting on golf courses. The comparison was based on a systems analysis and an individual economic feasibility study for each of the three applications. The results showed that in all three scenarios, the robotic applications are more economically feasible than the conventional systems. The high cost of real time kinematics Global Positioning System (RTK-GPS) and the small capacity of the vehicles are the main parameters that increase the cost of the robotic systems.

AB In addition to red-green-blue (RGB) camera sensors, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) plays an important role in autonomous vehicles (AVs) to perceive their surroundings. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are able to achieve cutting-edge 3-D object detection and segmentation performance using LiDAR point clouds. LiDAR-enabled AVs provide human perception by segmenting LiDAR point clouds into meaningful regions and providing semantic context to the AV user. However, the generation of point clouds to provide semantic segmentation in AVs is not reliable and secure, which may result in traffic accidents. We propose a novel adversarial attack against LiDAR point clouds in AVs in this article. We devised an exchange vanishing adversarial attack (EVAA) to deceive LiDAR point clouds by introducing targeted noise on specific objects (e.g., vehicles and driveways). In two autonomous driving datasets with 3-D object annotations, NuScenes and PandaSet, we evaluate the performance of our proposed attack framework. We achieve an attack success rate (ASR) of approximate to 63% and ASR of approximate to 29% on both NuScenes and PandaSet datasets, respectively.

AB Autonomous submerged dredging offers numerous benefits, such as reduced ship resistance and lower vacuum requirements for the dredge pumps. However, this method also presents new challenges, such as stability and buoyancy control, which must be addressed to minimize the energy requirements and ensure cost-effectiveness and sustainability. To achieve these goals, this paper proposes a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy to minimize control effort and energy requirements. Compared to traditional motion control methods such as proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, MPC shows great promise in terms of energy efficiency and trajectory-tracking. The Autonomous Low Energy Replenishment Dredger (ALERD) is used as a case study to showcase the potential of the proposed control strategy. A time-domain simulation model is developed, and the ALERD is modeled as an underwater vehicle using a state-space representation. The classic PID control and the proposed MPC framework are compared in terms of trajectory-tracking, energy requirements, and robustness to modeling uncertainties, using sensitivity analysis. The results show that the proposed MPC control framework outperforms PID control in all aspects considered. Furthermore, a comparison between the energy requirements of the ALERD and a conventional dredger, for the same operational profile and hopper volume, indicates that autonomous submerged dredging can potentially decrease total energy requirements by 66%.

TI Dynamic identity-based broadcast proxy re-encryption for data sharing in
   autonomous vehicles
SO TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs), as the essential part of intelligent autonomous transportation system, improves vehicle communication efficiency and supports diverse kinds of social services. However, with the development of AVs, more data has been generated by the sensors about the road, traffic, street light, and weather conditions. This also inevitably bringing new security problems, such as secure data sharing. Although the identity-based broadcast proxy re-encryption (IBBPRE) can be used to realize one-to-many data sharing, most existing schemes require access to the data owner for the group shared key update phases since the data owner's private key is mandatory for the group shared key generation. Therefore, frequent interaction with the data owner increases the operational burden and risks leaking the data owner's private key. Thus, we design a dynamic identity-based broadcast proxy re-encryption (DIB-BPRE) to solve the problem of re-encryption update. In the proposed scheme, a vehicle cloud server directly revokes or adds a group of data receivers, designated by the data owner, from the re-encryption key. Finally, the theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that the DIB-BPRE scheme is efficient, and it is suitable for data sharing in AVs.

AB In this paper, the predictive data-driven control of Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) systems is investigated to improve the energy efficiency of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Algorithms in AVs are expected to autonomously adapt and optimize themselves with different drive cycle conditions using the collected data during driving operation. We propose a Data Driven Control (DDC) framework for the speed ratio of CVTs in AVs which can learn the optimum pattern from archived real data. It includes a data archiving cycle in which the required DDC input/output signals of the vehicle are recorded. A DDC framework then runs in the driving cycle which includes a rolling optimization problem. More specifically, we use a predictive DDC algorithm to learn the optimal CVT speed ratio during the driving cycle instead of using the traditional pre-defined mapping. Using this framework, the CVT controller can adapt itself to any drive cycle by appropriately collecting data during the archiving cycle. The proposed control framework shows a satisfactory performance in HWFET and NEDC drive cycles. It reduces energy consumption by 1-5% compared to the pre-defined mappings.

AB This article studies the control problem of autonomous vehicle path following with coordination of active front steering and differential steering. A hierarchical control scheme including upper layer and lower layer is proposed. In the upper layer controller, a linear quadratic regulator based on extended state observer is proposed to generate the front-wheel steering angle and external yaw moment, where extended state observer is used to estimate and compensate for the system uncertainty and external disturbance which enhances the capability of the vehicle to suppress the disturbance. A brake force distribution scheme based on the theory of control allocation is proposed in the lower layer controller to optimize and coordinate each wheel brake force to achieve differential steering. Finally, the effectiveness of proposed control scheme is verified in a co-simulation platform based on CarSim/Simulink; it can be concluded that the linear quadratic regulator based on extended state observer scheme not only has a few parameters need to be tuned, but also has the capability of active disturbance rejection.

AB In this paper, simulation based performance analysis of an autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval system (AVS/RS) is presented. AVS/RS represents relatively a new system for automated unit-load (UL) storage based on autonomous vehicle (AV) technology. This new system consists of AVs, lifts and storage racks. It is implemented at scores of facilities in Europe. The aim of this study is to find out near optimum values for number of AVs and lifts in the system that result in high performance under various pre-defined storage rack configuration scenarios. The storage rack of the system is defined in terms of number of aisles, bays and tiers. We consider seven rack configuration scenarios, ten and nine vehicles per zone and two arrival rates - 450 and 500 pallets/h. The performance measures considered are: average cycle time of storage and retrieval transactions, average utilizations of AVs and lifts. The simulation model of the system is developed using ARENA 12.0, a commercial software. We find that having a large number of lifts (zones) and a large footprint yield better performance.

AB The recent advancements in wireless technology enable connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to gather information about their environment by vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. In this work, we design an information-sharing based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for CAVs, to take advantage of the extra information when making decisions to improve traffic efficiency and safety. The safe actor-critic algorithm we propose has two new techniques: the truncated Q-function and safe action mapping. The truncated Q-function utilizes the shared information from neighboring CAVs such that the joint state and action spaces of the Q-function do not grow in our algorithm for a large-scale CAV system. We prove the bound of the approximation error between the truncated -Q and global Q-functions. The safe action mapping provides a provable safety guarantee for both the training and execution based on control barrier functions. Using the CARLA simulator for experiments, we show that our approach improves the CAV system's efficiency in terms of average velocity and comfort under different CAV ratios and different traffic densities. We also show that our approach avoids the execution of unsafe actions and always maintains a safe distance from other vehicles. We construct an obstacle-at-corner scenario to show that the shared vision can help CAVs to observe obstacles earlier and take action to avoid traffic jams. The experiment video is on https://songyanghan.github.io/cavmarl/.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Although waste stabilization ponds (WSPs) are widely used in developing countries, monitoring data on their operational performance are scarce. Traditional methods for monitoring in-pond conditions, i.e. conducting hand held measurements from a small boat or installing fixed sensor networks, are not straightforward to realize and create an unhealthy working environment for field workers. A promising technology for the safe and efficient collection of monitoring data is a compact autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), capable of autonomous navigation along a predefined trajectory based on geographic coordinates and measurements in different places and depths. In this practical paper, the development process, technical details and functional testing results of a low-cost ASV for WSP monitoring are presented. Commonly available construction materials and electronic components were used to ensure affordability and reparability. The access to online tutorials and peer-support was crucial for assembling the open-source autopilot and data logger. The ASV demonstrated satisfactory performance for both the autonomous navigation as well as the georeferenced data logging of measurements at a real-scale WSP in Paraguay. This study demonstrates how the adoption of open-source hardware and software offers the flexibility for the wastewater professionals to develop customized DIY solutions for specific monitoring applications and working environments.

AB This paper presents a distributed event-driven adaptive formation control strategy for networked uncertain nonlinear autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in three-dimensional space. It is assumed that the leader information is only transmitted to a subset of AUV followers under a directed graph and the nonlinearities of the AUV dynamics are unknown. A distributed error transformation method is presented to address the distributed formation tracking problem of AUV followers in three-dimensional space. Then, a distributed event-driven adaptive control method using neural networks and stabilizing auxiliary signals is developed to ensure the stability of the event-driven closed-loop system and accomplish three-dimensional formation tracking in the Lyapunov stability sense. Additionally, it is shown that Zeno behavior does not occur in the resulting event-triggering strategy. A simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical methodology.

Firstly, based on the line-of-sight method, the moving target tracking guidance strategy is designed, and the target tracking reference speed and reference angular velocity are given. According to the obtained reference speed and reference angular velocities, the reference control quantity is differentiated and filtered based on dynamic surface control. The target tracking controller is designed based on radial basis function neural network and nonsingular terminal sliding mode control and adaptive techniques. Lyapunov stability principle is utilized to ensure the asymptotic stability of the target tracking controller. Simulation of target tracking is carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

AB Reinforcement learning schemes perform direct on-line search in control space. This makes them appropriate for modifying control rules to obtain improvements in the performance of a system. The effectiveness of a reinforcement learning strategy is studied here through the training of a learning classifier system (LCS) that controls the movement of an autonomous vehicle in simulated paths including left and right turns. The LCS comprises a set of condition-action rules (classifiers) that compete to control the system and evolve by means of a genetic algorithm (GA). Evolution and operation of classifiers depend upon an appropriate credit assignment mechanism based on reinforcement learning. Different design options and the role of various parameters have been investigated experimentally. The performance of vehicle movement under the proposed evolutionary approach is superior compared with that of other (neural) approaches based on reinforcement learning that have been applied previously to the same benchmark problem.

AB The use of autonomous robots is appealing for tasks, which are dangerous to humans. Autonomous robots might fail to perform their tasks since they are susceptible to varied sorts of faults such as point and contextual faults. Not all faults can be known in advance, and hence, anomaly detection is required. In this paper, we present an online data-driven anomaly detection approach (ODDAD) for autonomous robots. ODDAD is suitable for the dynamic nature of autonomous robots since it declares a fault based only on data collected online. In addition, it is unsupervised, model free and domain independent. ODDAD proceeds in three steps: data filtering, attributes grouping based on dependency between attributes and outliers detection for each group. Above a calculated threshold, an anomaly is declared. We empirically evaluate ODDAD in different domains: commercial unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), a vacuum-cleaning robot, a high-fidelity flight simulator and an electrical power system of a spacecraft. We show the significance and impact of each component of ODDAD . By comparing ODDAD to other state-of-the-art competing anomaly detection algorithms, we show its advantages.

DE Autonomous vehicles; Latency; Video transmission; Wireless networking;
   Autonomous agriculture; Raspberry Pi
AB As the prominence of autonomous vehicles continues to rise within agriculture, remote surveillance of the equipment is likely to become a key aspect of operation. Transmission latency during the relay of video from vehicle to viewer is not well explored and is an important part of communications which should be assessed. A riding mower was equipped with a Raspberry Pi using GStreamer and an open-source latency measurement library to assemble a real-time streaming system to evaluate transmission latency in different environments using cellular and radio transmission. In most locations, measured latencies were under 200-300 ms. In areas where cellular connection quality was adequate, cellular latency and variance were reduced compared to that of radio transmission for higher qualities of video. In areas of poor cellular network coverage, cellular transmission latency increased while radio transmission latencies remained constant. Overall, latency tends to increase with video quality to a statistically significant degree. It is recommended that real-time video can be transmitted over short distances for edge-of-field surveillance of autonomous agricultural machines using existing cellular networks in areas where adequate cellular signal strength is available. If adequate cellular signal strength is not available in a specific field location, it is recommended that video should be transmitted using radio transmission.

AB We investigate how susceptible human drivers are to auditory signals in three situations: when stationary, when driving, or when being driven by an autonomous vehicle. Previous research has shown that human susceptibility is reduced when driving compared to when being stationary. However, it is not known how susceptible humans are under autonomous driving conditions. At the same time, good susceptibility is crucial under autonomous driving conditions, as such systems might use auditory signals to communicate a transition of control from the automated vehicle to the human driver. We measured susceptibility using a three-stimulus auditory oddball paradigm while participants experienced three driving conditions: stationary, autonomous, or driving. We studied susceptibility through the frontal P3 (fP3) Electroencephalography Event-Related Potential response (EEG ERP response). Results show that the fP3 component is reduced in autonomous compared to stationary conditions, but not as strongly as when participants drove themselves. In addition, the fP3 component is further reduced when the oddball task does not require a response (i.e., in a passive condition, versus active). The implication is that, even in a relatively simple autonomous driving scenario, people's susceptibility of auditory signals is not as high as would be beneficial for responding to auditory stimuli.

AB Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) have the advantages of both autonomous driving technology and shared transportation, which is an important development direction for intelligent and green transportation in the future. However, a lack of trust and a high perceived risk have reduced the public's willingness to use this mode of travel. To improve the public's willingness to use it, many scholars have conducted research, but young people are still a neglected group. A structural equation model was used to test the models based on 316 survey samples. The results indicated that initial trust had a significant positive effect on the intention to use SAVs, while perceived security risk and perceived privacy risk had no significant effect on the intention to use, but perceived security risk can indirectly negatively affect the intention to use. In addition, attitude and face consciousness had a significant positive influence on intention to use, while subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and perceived usefulness had a significant indirect positive influence on intention to use SAVs. The findings showed that the model used in this paper was reasonable and valid for explaining young people's willingness to use SAVs. This will provide guidance for formulating more effective strategies for this group.

AB Automated driving technology is one of the emerging technologies which will change the transportation mode in the future. Distributing the automated driving vehicles from the automobile factory to dealers has a huge difference compared with traditional vehicles. This paper considers the variety of cases where the automated driving vehicles can be both distribution tools and distribution goods. Then establishes a new distribution model that integrates self-distribution of autonomous vehicles into the existing distribution rings form a complex network composed of ring-branches. This cooperative distribution model of automated driving and traditional vehicle transport to minimize transportation cost and maximize the overall efficiency. Furthermore, we design an improved adaptive large neighborhood algorithm (ALNS) to solve the model which combines the merger heuristics and splitter heuristics to promote generate the optimal solutions. The efficiency of our proposed method is proved by real-world data from an automobile enterprise. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis of the maximum distance for automated driving vehicles to be delivered by themselves suggests that the larger distance, the more outstanding of cost reduction and efficiency increase for our proposed model.

AB In autonomous driving vehicles, the heterogeneity between human and automation agents can cause conflicts in decision-making and behaviour due to the difference in perception of hazardous situations. Augmented Reality Human-Machine Interfaces (AR-HMI) provide an opportunity to support driving performance by enabling drivers to intuitively access shared perception and explanation of the automated vehicle. One possible approach to AR-HMI design is to simplify the information of driving tasks based on vehicle context understanding, although there is currently a lack of systematic understanding of how collaborative mechanisms or cognitive features contribute to AR-HMI information design. Therefore, this work develops an augmented reality cognitive interface design method for autonomous driving. It aims to identify novel collaborative interface information visualization and provide a common language and inspiration for the design space.

AB This letter presents a method for the precise cable-guided landing of tethered drones. The proposed approach is based on a continuous velocity vector field that relies on the tether variables only. We assume that the vehicle is attached to a landing platform through a tensioned and free-of-collision cable whose length and angles are measured by a tether management system. We do not assume that the cable is taut. The method is suitable for highly degraded environments, where traditional landing strategies based on GNSS and vision are not feasible, such as dark underground mines and caves. This letter shows that, besides being easy to implement and adjust, the proposed vector field is proven to correctly guide the vehicle to its desired landing position. Experiments with a quad-rotor vehicle landing on static and moving platforms illustrate the precision, robustness, and efficacy of the method.

AB Autonomous vehicles need a real-time traffic tracking system in order to interact with multiple moving vehicles in urban situations. Most existing works rely on camera sensors to interpret the surrounding environment. However, camera sensors degrade in conditions of lighting, shadows, and extreme weathers such that they can hardly detect objects. The light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors promise to be a good substitute, as they enable highly precise and robust localization across a wide range of conditions. This paper presents a new LiDAR-based online multiple maneuvering vehicle tracking problem and proposes a novel online multi-model smooth variable structure filter to address the problem. The real-time experiments show that our method is able to deliver superior performance compared to other conventional methods.

AB This paper presents modeling, analysis, and controller design of the steering subsystem of heavy vehicles as a subsystem of vehicle lateral control system for the automated highway systems. A physical model of the steering subsystem is derived where the hydraulic power assist unit is modeled as a family of static nonlinear boost curves. Based on open-loop frequency tests and analysis of the physical model structure and its dynamical characteristics, a nominal second order linear model of the steering subsystem is obtained. Then, a linear robust loop-shaping controller is designed to provide a good tracking performance of the closed-loop dynamics of the steering subsystem for varying gain cross over frequencies which is a result of the nonlinear characteristics of the hydraulic power assist. The controller has been successfully incorporated as an inner-loop controller into the nested lateral control architecture for autonomous driving and its efficacy has been demonstrated experimentally.

ID SELF-CALIBRATION; LIDAR
AB Calibrating a platform with multiple sensors is a fundamental work for autonomous vehicle systems. This paper proposes an effective multi-sensor calibration method which consists of three aspects: single-sensor intrinsic calibration, multi-sensor extrinsic calibration and multi-sensor time synchronisation. Involved sensors in our proposed approach include LiDAR, Camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Firstly, a motion model based method is proposed to calibrate the intrinsic parameters of the IMU. Secondly, besides using the distance factor of the laser beam to develop the intrinsic parameters calibration method of LiDAR, we also introduce the idea of frangibility to optimise the calibration parameters. The results of these two stages give the initial state information of the sensors for latter calibration. Thirdly, based on the idea of hand-eye calibration, we design an external parameter calibration method to estimate the actual external parameters for a multi-sensor system. Experiment results show the practical validity of the proposed algorithm.

AB Over the past several decades, there has been a constant increase in the use of unmanned aircraft systems (UASs). Hence, there has also been a growth in the number of control algorithms to service many applications embodied by these vehicles. Initially, UASs were made popular by the military for reconnaissance, intelligence, surveillance, and target acquisition (RISTA) applications. Nowadays, UASs are used for everything from crop surveys to tourism. Nowhere is this more evident than with a multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). This paper presents a survey of control methods for multi-rotor systems, namely quadrotors. In doing so, we hope to visualize a clear path to what additional capabilities might be needed in the future. In our examination, we review many of the notable research organizations and their efforts to expand the utility of multi-rotor aircraft. We also summarize the basic literature definitions and control strategies for autonomous quadrotors.

AB This paper provides a taxonomy of different forms of autonomous vehicle handover situations. It covers scheduled, emergency and non-emergency handovers and it differentiates between system and driver initiated handovers. The purpose is to examine how the system and driver are responsible for different stages in the transition timeline, i.e., first alert, handover phase, and return to automated control (handback). This is examined from the perspective of SAE levels in comparison to aspects drawn from situational awareness. The work is complemented by analysis drawn from current practice within the insurance industry and interviews with insurers. The result is a closer examination of system and driver responsibility which is independent of but includes SAE levels with respect to specific handover situations. It also identifies gaps between the current legal liability for accidents when compared to aspects such as the situational awareness requirements placed on driver under different driving conditions.

AB This article shows how a non-monotonic rule based system (defeasible logic) can be integrated with numerical computation engines, and how this can be applied to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem. To this end, we have simulated a physical system from which we can obtain numerical information. The physical system perceives information from its environment and generates predicates that can be reasoned by a defeasible logic engine. The conclusions/decisions derived will then be realized by the physical system as it takes actions based on the conclusion derived. Here we consider a scenario where a 'flock' of Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles (UAVs) have to navigate within an urban canyon environment. The UAVs are self-autonomous without centralized control. The goal of the UAVs is to navigate to their desired destinations without colliding with each other. In case of possible collision, the UAVs concerned will communicate with each other and use their background knowledge or travel guidelines to resolve the conflicts.

AB Focus groups on shared, autonomous vehicles (SAVs) in New South Wales expressed "sharing anxiety"-an intense concern about the prospect of sharing their mobility journey with strangers, without a driver or authority figure present. This presents a significant barrier to the acceptance of SAVs, particularly autonomous public and on-demand transport (ODT), which is a major focus for Transport for New South Wales (TfNSW). Given this potential barrier, we interviewed (N = 13) operators, academics, and regulators with TfNSW to assess their role and abilities in overcoming sharing anxiety. However, our findings revealed a relative lack of awareness from experts in the mobility industry about the existence of sharing anxiety in users, suggesting additional barriers to adoption. We make suggestions for policy considerations for stakeholders that could mitigate sharing anxiety: promoting dynamic ridepooling products in commercial services, using tax breaks as incentivization; requiring ODT services and operators in jurisdiction to use a standardized, unified interface for users ("single-app"); shared, on-demand transport services likely need longer incubation/pilot periods in order for the sharing behavior to become culturally established. We conclude with a reflection on how COVID-19 has impacted the development of shared mobility and suggest further exploration in policy implementation.

AB Guaranteeing real-time and accurate object detection simultaneously is paramount in autonomous driving environments. However, the existing object detection neural network systems are characterized by a tradeoff between computation time and accuracy, making it essential to optimize such a tradeoff. Fortunately, in many autonomous driving environments, images come in a continuous form, providing an opportunity to use optical flow. In this paper, we improve the performance of an object detection neural network utilizing optical flow estimation. In addition, we propose a Lyapunov optimization framework for time-average performance maximization subject to stability. It adaptively determines whether to use optical flow to suit the dynamic vehicle environment, thereby ensuring the vehicle's queue stability and the time-average maximum performance simultaneously. To verify the key ideas, we conduct numerical experiments with various object detection neural networks and optical flow estimation networks. In addition, we demonstrate the self-configurable stabilized detection with YOLOv3-tiny and FlowNet2-S, which are the real-time object detection network and an optical flow estimation network, respectively. In the demonstration, our proposed framework improves the accuracy by 3.02%, the number of detected objects by 59.6%, and the queue stability for computing capabilities.

AB Nowadays, physically impaired people still struggle with daily tasks when using mobility aid devices, whether for crossing doors, parking or manoeuvring in their homes. In this context, assistive robotics can offer solutions to those problems, thus increasing the users' quality of life. However, studies must be performed to determine the best architecture for human-robot interaction. In this work, we propose a collaborative navigation strategy for improving users' skills for driving assistive vehicles. We present four navigation modes: manual, assisted manual, autonomous and assisted autonomous. In particular in the two assisted modes, the system is able to predict the user's motion intentions, reducing his/her workload. The system was validated in a real world environment with a population of twenty volunteers. Objective and subjective metrics were used to asses the system's performance and usability, with special consideration to human factors. Results show that the system aids users to perform navigation tasks in a clear and compliant manner using a robotic assistive vehicle, while decreasing their perceived workload by 15% for the assisted manual, 41% for the autonomous and 40% for the assisted autonomous, when compared to the manual mode. Additionally, it is shown that if autonomous navigation sets a lower bound for user workload, the system approximates this bound while improving performance.

AB This paper addresses the congestion management issues of a bottleneck-constrained highway system with manned vehicles (MVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs). A novel model that in-corporates the in-vehicle activity utilities and activity type choices of AV commuters is presented for analyzing the equilibrium of the bi-modal bottleneck system with MVs and AVs. Time-varying and step tolling schemes accounting for the effects of in-vehicle activity utilities are analytically explored. In particular, a differentiated and a non-differentiated (or anonymous) step tolling scheme for the mixed MV and AV traffic system are analyzed and compared. The differentiated step tolling scheme means different toll levels across MV and AV commuters, whereas the non -differentiated step tolling scheme means an identical toll level for both the MV and AV com-muters. The results show that a queuing segregation phenomenon occurs between the MV and AV commuters. The optimal AV proportion solution that minimizes the total social cost of the mixed MV and AV system exists. For a pure MV or AV system, the optimal step toll scheme can eliminate exactly half of the total queuing delay with the no-toll equilibrium for each of the differentiated and non-differentiated step tolling schemes. However, for a mixed MV and AV system, the queuing removal rate of the optimal differentiated step tolling scheme would exceed a half, whereas that of the optimal non-differentiated step tolling scheme may be lower than a half. The differentiated step tolling scheme outperforms the non-differentiated step tolling scheme in terms of total social cost and queuing removal rate.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are around the corner, and adopting this technology will create a revolution in our transportation system. Mass adoption of AVs might have both positive and negative impacts to travel demand and the transportation system. How we adopt, matters. Several studies show that private AVs might lead to more travel demand and dispersed urban patterns, but shared AVs might contribute otherwise. This paper presents an overview of and a modelling work on a dataset collected in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) to understand consumers' willingness-to-pay for various automation levels in their vehicles simultaneously with private and shared ownership types. The study used 190 records from a reasonably representative sample collected from the study area. Heteroskedastic error-component mixed multinomial and nested logit models are formatted for different vehicle ownerships in this study. Strong inertia effect of staying with private conventional vehicles (PCVs) is identified. We also discover that private vehicle buyers will find level 4 vehicles attractive, whereas car-sharing service users will favour level 5 vehicles. For level 4 vehicles, consumers are willing to pay from CAN $ 10,800 to CAN $ 29,800, depending on the vehicle price. We also find that respondents' age, family members' health conditions, commuting conditionals, and household incomes will influence their willingness to pay for owning AVs.

AB A crucial component of an autonomous vehicle (AV) is the artificial intelligence (AI) is able to drive towards a desired destination. Today, there are different paradigms addressing the development of AI drivers. On the one hand, we find modular pipelines, which divide the driving task into sub-tasks such as perception and maneuver planning and control. On the other hand, we find end-to-end driving approaches that try to learn a direct mapping from input raw sensor data to vehicle control signals. The later are relatively less studied, but are gaining popularity since they are less demanding in terms of sensor data annotation. This paper focuses on end-to-end autonomous driving. So far, most proposals relying on this paradigm assume RGB images as input sensor data. However, AVs will not be equipped only with cameras, but also with active sensors providing accurate depth information (e.g., LiDARs). Accordingly, this paper analyses whether combining RGB and depth modalities, i.e. using RGBD data, produces better end-to-end AI drivers than relying on a single modality. We consider multimodality based on early, mid and late fusion schemes, both in multisensory and single-sensor (monocular depth estimation) settings. Using the CARLA simulator and conditional imitation learning (CIL), we show how, indeed, early fusion multimodality outperforms single-modality.

AB The Intelligent and Connected Vehicle (ICV) is regarded as a high-tech solution to reducing road traffic crashes in many countries across the world. However, it is not clear how effective these technologies are in avoiding crashes. This study sets out to summarize the evidence for the crash avoidance effectiveness of technologies equipped on ICVs. In this study, three common methods for safety benefit evaluation were identified: Field operation test (FOT), safety impact methodology (SIM), and statistical analysis methodology (SAM). The advantages and disadvantages of the three methods are compared. In addition, evidence for the crash avoidance effectiveness of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication Systems (V2V) are presented in the paper. More specifically, target crash scenarios and the effectiveness of technologies including FCW/AEB, ACC, LDW/LDP, BSD, IMA, and LTA are different. Overall, based on evidence from the literature, technologies on ICVs could significantly reduce the number of crashes.

AB In this paper, we propose a robust point cloud registration method for ground vehicles. Given the vast developments in the field of autonomous vehicles, the use of point cloud data has increased. The simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm is typically used to generate sophisticated point cloud maps. In the SLAM algorithm, the quality of the map depends on the performance of loop closure algorithms. The iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm is widely used for loop closure of the point cloud. However, the ICP algorithm might not work well for ground vehicles because it was originally developed for 3D reconstruction in computer vision field. Therefore, this paper proposes a method to find robust matching correspondences in the ICP algorithm on ground vehicle conditions. The performance of the proposed method is compared with other conventional methods by using KITTI open datasets. The source code is publicly released on the Github website.

AB This study introduces a hybrid control structure called Improved Interfered Fluid Dynamic System Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (IIFDS-NMPC) for the path planning and trajectory tracking of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The system consists of two layers; the upper layer utilizes the Improved Interfered Fluid Dynamic System (IIFDS) for path planning, while the lower layer employs Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) for trajectory tracking. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted to determine optimal parameters for both static and dynamic obstacle scenarios. Additionally, real-world testing is performed using the BlueRov2 platform, incorporating multiple dynamic and static obstacles. The proposed approach achieves real-time control at a frequency of 100 Hz and exhibits impressive path tracking accuracy, with a root mean square (RMS) of 0.02 m. This research provides a valuable framework for navigation and control in practical applications.

AB Amsterdam is a culturally rich city attracting millions of tourists. Popular activities in Amsterdam consist of museum visits and boat tours. By strategically combining them, this paper presents an innovative approach using waterborne autonomous vehicles (WAVs) to improve the museum visitation in Amsterdam. Multi-source urban data including I Amsterdam card data and Instagram hashtags are used to reveal museum characteristics such as offline and online popularity of museums and visitation patterns. A multi-objective model is proposed to optimize WAV routes by considering museum characteristics and travel experiences. An experiment in the Amsterdam Central area was conducted to evaluate the viability of employing WAVs. By comparing WAVs with land transportation, the results demonstrate that WAVs can enhance travel experience to cultural destinations. The presented innovative WAVs can be extended to a larger variety of points of interest in cities. These findings provide useful insights on embracing artificial intelligence in urban tourism.

AB This paper presents a rotation-resilient wireless charging system with a reversely wound receiver that supports efficient charging for lightweight autonomous underwater vehicles. By employing a two-part reversely wound receiver coil structure, the total mutual inductance of the proposed coil structure remains relatively constant when rotational misalignment between the transmitter and receiver coils occurs, thereby ensuring wireless charging power is nearly continuous during rotational misalignment. Finite element analysis was performed with ANSYS Maxwell to verify the proposed coil structure. Double-sided LCC compensation topology was applied and circuit analysis was conducted via a mesh current method. A prototype of the rotation-resilient wireless charging system with the proposed coil structure was built and tested. Experimental results are well-matched to simulations, demonstrating that the system can deliver 745 Watts at a dc-dc efficiency of 86.19% when the system is fully aligned, and efficient under worst-case rotational misalignment.

It is based on specific immune response of the biological immune system which is the cell-mediated immune response. It is also applied for the autonomous guided vehicle (AGV) system which is manufactured in this paper. The AGV is used for the port automation to carry container without human and to overcome uncertainty and nonlinearity because of running in the outdoor. To verify the performance of the proposed CMIA controller, some experiments for the AGV system are performed. Finally, the experimental results for the control of steering and speed of an AGV system illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. These results for the proposed method also show that it has better performance than other conventional controller design methods.

AB Connected vehicles will enable the smart and autonomous transportation systems in the future. Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) communication will provide wireless connectivity to enable large number of connected vehicle applications. Vehicles will receive traffic and infotainment contents from the city traffic command center using C-V2X communications. In this context, infrastructure Road Side Units (RSUs) will cache urgent and popular data in their memory storage, hence providing vehicles to retrieve information from a closer vicinity at a RSU. In this paper, we present a content caching policy for the connected vehicles operator to improve the efficiency of the content retrieval in terms of download rate and delay. We propose the utility functions for the RSUs and vehicles to cache a particular content at a given RSU. Moreover, GaleShapley stable matching algorithm is used to efficiently allocate RSU cache to the contents. We also provide rules to update the cache slots. The proposed caching scheme is compared with random caching policy and market matching based caching policies. Results show that the proposed content caching policy improves the efficiency of the content retrieval with 60% more data transmission with reduced downloading time and better link utilization as compared to other two scheme.

AB Vehicle control in autonomous traffic flow is often handled using the best decision-making reinforcement learning methods. However, unexpected critical situations make the collisions more severe and, consequently, the chain collisions. In this work, we first review the leading causes of chain collisions and their subsequent chain events, which might provide an indication of how to prevent and mitigate the crash severity of chain collisions. Then, we consider the problem of chain collision avoidance as a Markov Decision Process problem in order to propose a reinforcement learning-based decision-making strategy and analyse the safety efficiency of existing methods in driving security. To address this, A reward function is being developed to deal with the challenge of multiple vehicle collision avoidance. A perception network structure based on formation and on actor-critic methodologies is employed to enhance the decision-making process. Finally, in the safety efficiency analysis phase, we investigated the safety efficiency performance of the agent vehicle in both single-agent and multi-agent autonomous driving environments. Three state-of-the-art contemporary actor-critic algorithms are used to create an extensive simulation in Unity3D. Moreover, to demonstrate the accuracy of the safety efficiency analysis, multiple training runs of the neural networks in respect of training performance, speed of training, success rate, and stability of rewards with a trade-off between exploitation and exploration during training are presented. Two aspects (single-agent and multi-agent) have assessed the efficiency of algorithms. Every aspect has been analyzed regarding the traffic flows: (1) the controlling efficiency of unexpected traffic situations by the sudden slowdown, (2) abrupt lane change, and (3) smoothly reaching the destination. All the findings of the analysis are intended to shed insight on the benefits of a greater, more reliable autonomous traffic set-up for academics and policymakers, and also to pave the way for the actual carry-out of a driver-less traffic world.

AB This paper investigates the trajectory tracking control problem for the autonomous surface vehicles with unknown dynamics and environmental disturbances. A novel adaptive fuzzy constrained control approach is put forward to deal with this problem. Instead of the exponentially decaying functions, a new-type performance envelop is designed to offer a way to explicitly and freely preassign the settling time and the accuracy of trajectory tracking. Moreover, in lieu of involving the approach angle or azimuth angle, a new idea for tackling underactuation is proposed that yields a singularity-free continuous control solution. The fuzzy logic systems are employed to address the unknown and lumped nonlinearities in the closed-loop system. The resulting control system possesses inherent robustness to the external disturbances and the second derivative of the reference trajectory, thus without the need for employing disturbance observers or assuming the available derivative information. It is demonstrated by the constraint analysis based on dialectic by contradiction that the developed control achieves arbitrarily fast and accurate trajectory tracking for the vehicle. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of our approach are verified by a comparative simulation.

AB A drift-driving maneuver is a control technique used by an expert driver to control a vehicle along a sharply curved path or slippery road. This study develops a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) method for the autonomous vehicle to perform a drift maneuver and generate the datasets necessary for training the deep neural network(DNN)-based drift controller. In general, the NMPC method is based on numerical optimization which is difficult to run in real-time. By replacing the previously designed NMPC method with the proposed DNN-based controller, we avoid the need for complex numerical optimization of the vehicle control, thereby reducing the computational load. The performance of the developed data-driven drift controller is verified through realistic simulations that included drift scenarios. Based on the results of the simulations, the DNN-based controller showed similar tracking performance to the original nonlinear model predictive controller; moreover, the DNN-based controller can demonstrate stable computation time, which is very important for the safety critical control objective such as drift maneuver.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) can eliminate the burden of finding a parking spot upon arrival to the destination. AVs can park at a strategic location or cruise until summoned by their users. In this study, we investigate AV users' parking decision considering their cost and time constraints. Each users' decision has impacts on congestion which can change feasible options of other users. Hence, we use an agent-based simulation model to study AV parking policies. Results show that travelers consider sending their vehicles to park at home if they have to pay to use a parking facility. Also, our analysis for downtown Toronto shows that AVs would travel on average 12 min and a maximum of 47 min to park in cheaper parking lots. We also find that assigning the same parking price across all the parking facilities would exacerbate the congestion by motiving more AVs to cruise instead of choosing the closest parking lot. However, we show that a toll for zero-occupant AVs leads to a tradeoff between parking cost and distance that would decrease the VKT by 3.5% in downtown Toronto.

AB This paper reviews how teleactivities, the sharing economy, and emerging transportation technologies ? components of what we could call the ?App City? ? may influence travel behavior and the built environment. Findings suggest that teleactivities may substitute some trips but generate others. Telework and teleconferencing may reduce total travel. Findings on the sharing economy suggest that accommodation sharing increases long-distance travel; bikesharing is conducive to more active travel and lower car use; carsharing may reduce private car use and ownership; ridesourcing (ridehailing) may increase vehicle miles traveled; while the implications of e-scooter sharing, ridesharing, and Mobility as a Service are context-dependent. Findings on emerging transportation technologies suggest that private autonomous vehicles and urban air mobility may increase total travel, whereas autonomous buses may lead to reduced car use. Implications of App Cities for the built environment include new transport systems and land use changes due to behavioral changes.

AB As intelligent driving vehicles came out of concept into people's life, the combination of safe driving and artificial intelligence becomes the new direction of future transportation development. Autonomous driving technology is developing based on control algorithms and model recognitions. In this paper, a cloud-based interconnected multi-sensor fusion autonomous vehicle system is proposed that uses deep learning (YOLOv4) and improved ORB algorithms to identify pedestrians, vehicles, and various traffic signs. A cloud-based interactive system is built to enable vehicle owners to master the situation of their vehicles at any time. In order to meet multiple application of automatic driving vehicles, the environment perception technology of multi-sensor fusion processing has broadened the uses of automatic driving vehicles by being equipped with automatic speech recognition (ASR), vehicle following mode and road patrol mode. These functions enable automatic driving to be used in applications such as agricultural irrigation, road firefighting and contactless delivery under new coronavirus outbreaks. Finally, using the embedded system equipment, an intelligent car was built for experimental verification, and the overall recognition accuracy of the system was over 96%.

AB This paper presents an unmanned surface vehicle Tritor that was developed, constructed, and tested within an innovative, multi-purpose, multidisciplinary, low-budget and environmentally friendly solution. The idea behind this work was trying to invent a new concept of a miniature surface vehicle that will be unmanned, remotely controlled and autonomous, with electric propulsion, and with an innovative Three Slender Cylinders Hull (3SCH) form gaining advantages in comparison to existing surface vehicles. This initial work is focused on vehicle prototype design, propulsion system development and optimization, control design, and trials, while research related to advantages of the vehicle in terms of naval architecture criteria such as drag and power, stability, seakeeping, and maneuverability will be investigated in further work. In addition, the paper intends to contribute to a new trend in developing vehicles with electrical propulsion that could use renewable sources of energy such as wind and solar energy. The potential usage of the vehicle can be civilian or military, and further work will be focused on larger models, improved based on the experience got during the development of the vehicle. Tritor vehicle was successfully designed, constructed, and tested in real environmental conditions. The preliminary results show that the vehicle has required performances and potential for improvements in the future. The main scientific contribution of this work is advanced surface vehicle development with a focus on a new hull form and the integration of electric propulsion in it.

AB The simultaneous localisation and map building (SLAM) problem asks if it is possible for an autonomous vehicle to start in an unknown location in an unknown environment and then to incrementally build a map of this environment while simultaneously using this map to compute absolute vehicle location. Starting from the estimation-theoretic foundations of this problem developed in [5, 4, 2], this paper proves that a solution to the SLAM problem is indeed possible. The underlying structure of the SLAM problem is first elucidated. A proof that the estimated map converges monotonically to a relative map with zero uncertainty is then developed. It is then shown that the absolute accuracy of the map and the vehicle location reach a lower bound defined only by the initial vehicle uncertainty. Together, these results show that it is possible for an autonomous vehicle to start in an unknown location in an unknown environment and, using relative observations only, incrementally build a perfect map of the world and simultaneously to compute a bounded estimate of vehicle location.

AB In this paper, a novel motion control scheme with guaranteed prescribed performance is proposed for autonomous vehicles with consideration of couplings between lateral and longitudinal motions. Firstly, a prescribed performance transformation function is constructed to equivalently release the output error constraints. Then, a coordinated controller is designed to complete lateral and longitudinal motion control tasks simultaneously based on sliding-mode control. The designed coordinated controller can guarantee predefined trajectory tracking performance (e.g., minimum speed of convergence, maximum steady state error and overshoot), in presence of strong-coupled characteristics, model uncertainties and external disturbance. Finally, simulation results under different boundary constraints further validate the feasibility and good robustness of the controller.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely applied in civilian and military applications due to their high autonomy and strong adaptability. Although UAVs can achieve effective cost reduction and flexibility enhancement in the development of large-scale systems, they result in a serious path planning and task allocation problem. Coverage path planning, which tries to seek flight paths to cover all of regions of interest, is one of the key technologies in achieving autonomous driving of UAVs and difficult to obtain optimal solutions because of its NP-Hard computational complexity. In this paper, we study the coverage path planning problem of autonomous heterogeneous UAVs on a bounded number of regions. First, with models of separated regions and heterogeneous UAVs, we propose an exact formulation based on mixed integer linear programming to fully search the solution space and produce optimal flight paths for autonomous UAVs. Then, inspired from density-based clustering methods, we design an original clustering-based algorithm to classify regions into clusters and obtain approximate optimal point-to-point paths for UAVs such that coverage tasks would be carried out correctly and efficiently. Experiments with randomly generated regions are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB SCUBA diving, professional or recreational, remains one of the most hazardous activities known by man, mostly due to the fact that the human survival in the underwater environment requires use of technical equipment such as breathing regulators. Loss of breathing gas supply, burst eardrum, decompression sickness and nitrogen narcosis are just a few problems which can occur during an ordinary dive and result in injuries, long-term illnesses or even death. Most common way to reduce the risk of diving is to dive in pairs, thus allowing divers to cooperate with each other and react when uncommon situation occurs. Having the ability to react before an unwanted situation happens would improve diver safety.
   This paper describes an autonomous marine robotic system that replaces a human dive buddy. Such a robotic system, developed within an FP7 project "CADDY - Cognitive Autonomous Diving Buddy" provides a symbiotic link between robots and human divers in the underwater. The proposed concept consists of a diver, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) Buddy and an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) PlaDyPos, acting within a cooperative network linked via an acoustic communication channel. This is a first time that an underwater human-robot system of such a scale has ever been developed. In this paper, focus is put on mechanical characteristics of the robotic vehicles.

AB Drivable area understanding is an essential problem in the fields of robot autonomous navigation. Mobile robots or other autonomous vehicles need to perceive their surrounding environments such as obstacles, lanes and freespace to ensure safety. Many recent works have made great achievements benefiting from the breakthrough of deep learning. However, those methods resolve the challenge in a separated way which cause repeated utilization of resources in some occasions. Thus, we present a unified lane and obstacle detection network, ULODNet, which can detect the lanes and obstacles in a joint manner and further frame the drivable areas for mobile robots or other autonomous vehicles. To better coordinate the training of ULODNet, we also create a new dataset, CULane-ULOD Dataset, based on the widely used CULane Dataset. The new dataset contains both the lane labels and obstacle labels which the original dataset do not have. At last, to construct an integrated autonomous driving scheme, an area intersection paradigm is introduced to generate the driving commands by calculating the obstacle area proportion in the drivable regions. Moreover, the well-designed comparison experiments verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the new algorithm.

AB This paper investigates the problem of region tracking control with prescribed transient performance for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in presence of ocean current and thruster fault. An adaptive region tracking control scheme with prescribed transient performance is proposed. On the basis of prescribed performance control concept, the proposed control scheme transforms the tracking error into a virtual error by combining with a prescribed performance function. And then the control law is derived by constructing a type piecewise and smooth Lyapunov function in the framework of backstepping technique. Moreover, the compensation of ocean current, modelling uncertainty and thruster fault is achieved by estimating the bound of the general uncertainty term and the variation of the thruster distribution matrixes. Finally, the proposed region tracking control scheme is applied on ODIN AUV, and the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB With the rise of a consciousness in warehousing sustainability, an increasing number of autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) is diffusing among automated warehouses. Moreover, manufacturers are offering the option of equipping machines with energy recovery systems. This study analyzed a deep-lane AVS/RS provided with an energy recovery system in order to make an energy evaluation for such a system. A simulator able to emulate the operation of the warehouse has been developed, including a travel-time and an energy model to consider the real operating characteristics of lifts, shuttles and satellites. Referring to a single command cycle with a basic storing and picking algorithm for multiple-depth channels, energy balance and recovery measurements have been presented and compared to those of a traditional crane-based system. Results show significant savings in energy consumption with the use of a deep-lane AVS/RS.

The main features of the system include non-penetrating power and data transfer without any auxiliary actuators, auto-orientation adjustment of the entrance, magnetic clamping of the AUV, and ultra-short baseline (USBL) and computer vision integrated navigation. A homing control method based on cross-track error for USBL navigation is proposed. Its design goal is to rapidly eliminate cross-track errors and change the behavior of the AUV smoothly without losing USBL signal in lateral current The prototype system was tested in a water pool. Light tracking, docking, and clamping were successful. The battery of the AUV was effectively charged by the non-penetrating power transfer component at 144 W, during which the non-penetrating data transfer component worked properly.

The method uses a multibeam imaging sonar as the main sensor to detect sea turtles. The method utilizes convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting a sea turtle in sonar imagery. Surge and yaw movements of the vehicle are controlled to maintain the relative distance and direction to the detected target. The proposed method was implemented in the AUV HATTORI. The AUV succeeded in tracking a sea turtle in natural condition for 270 seconds in shallow sea.

AB The lane-change strategy of autonomous vehicles is affected by its leading vehicle. It is necessary and challenging to simultaneously conduct the lane-change maneuvers while avoiding collisions with the leading vehicle. This article proposes a lane-change strategy considering the leading vehicle by synthesizing vehicle velocity prediction, motion planning, and trajectory tracking control. A scenario-based velocity prediction method using the input-output hidden Markov model (HMM) is proposed to predict the leading vehicle velocity. Then a motion planner integrating the predicted velocity is developed to generate the optimal trajectories for the lane-change maneuvers. The generated trajectories are tracked by a trajectory tracking controller. An improved composite nonlinear feedback (CNF) control algorithm is proposed to obtain smooth transient performances and fast responses. Human driver tests on a driving simulator show the leading vehicle velocity can be predicted by the proposed method. The motion planner and the trajectory tracking controller are validated in the CarSim simulations. The collision-free optimal trajectories are generated and tracked by the motion planner and the improved CNF controller. A systematic lane-change strategy considering the leading vehicle is effectively developed in this study.

AB Efficient intersection planning is one of the most challenging tasks for an autonomous vehicle at present. The degree of response to other traffic participants and whether the path tracking effect is good are the key aspects that determine the performance of planning algorithm for an autonomous vehicle. In order to deal with these problems, in this paper, the frame structure of POMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes) and the time distance coordinate system are combined to carry out the speed planning for the self-propelled vehicle. The speed planning designs a novel POMDP model to ensure effective prediction of behavioral intentions and decision-making at intersections with no traffic signs. Specifically, the method is considered both the driving position and the time range of arrival of the vehicle at the intersection in real-world situations. At the same time, the algorithm is projected the state information into the time distance coordinate system in the form of probability, and used the value iteration method to solve the optimal solution, so as to improve the adaptability of the algorithm to real-world scenarios. Furthermore, MPC control is added on this basis. Rational use of dynamic MPC and kinematic MPC can effectively reduce the tracking error, improve the stability of tracking, and carry out finer control when the speed frequently fluctuates.

AB Recent advances in acoustic navigation methods are enabling extended autonomous underwater vehicles' (AUVs) mission time while maintaining their XY position error within appropriate limits. Furthermore, while advances in inertial sensor technology are drastically lowering the size, power consumption, and cost of these sensors, these sensors remain noisy and accrue error over time. This paper builds on the research and recent developments in single beacon one-way-travel-time acoustic navigation and investigates the degree of bounding position error for small AUVs with a minimal navigation strapdown sensor suite, relying on a consumer grade microelectromechanical system inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a vehicle's dynamic model velocity. An implementation of an extended Kalman filter that includes IMU bias estimation and coupled with a range filter is obtained in the field on two types of AUVs. Results from these field trials in controlled environments and ocean show that the reported navigation solution possesses an accuracy comparable to existing methods.

   Responsibility; Liability; Duty to intervene
AB A number of companies including Google and BMW are currently working on the development of autonomous cars. But if fully autonomous cars are going to drive on our roads, it must be decided who is to be held responsible in case of accidents. This involves not only legal questions, but also moral ones. The first question discussed is whether we should try to design the tort liability for car manufacturers in a way that will help along the development and improvement of autonomous vehicles. In particular, Patrick Lin's concern that any security gain derived from the introduction of autonomous cars would constitute a trade-off in human lives will be addressed. The second question is whether it would be morally permissible to impose liability on the user based on a duty to pay attention to the road and traffic and to intervene when necessary to avoid accidents. Doubts about the moral legitimacy of such a scheme are based on the notion that it is a form of defamation if a person is held to blame for causing the death of another by his inattention if he never had a real chance to intervene. Therefore, the legitimacy of such an approach would depend on the user having an actual chance to do so. The last option discussed in this paper is a system in which a person using an autonomous vehicle has no duty (and possibly no way) of interfering, but is still held (financially, not criminally) responsible for possible accidents. Two ways of doing so are discussed, but only one is judged morally feasible.

In the first part of this work, after defining the design of the vehicle, we introduce our vision of the swarm, its problems, and its strengths. Later, we show how to spread a series of underwater drones with "diffused intelligence" (swarm) and its microscopic diffusion model.

ID ALGORITHM
AB The stable detection and tracking of high-speed vehicles on the road by using LiDAR can input accurate information for the decision-making module and improve the driving safety of smart cars. This paper proposed a novel LiDAR-based robust vehicle detection method including three parts: point cloud clustering, bounding box fitting and point cloud recognition. Firstly, aiming at the problem of clustering quality degradation caused by the uneven distribution of LiDAR point clouds and the difference in clustering radius between point cloud clusters in traditional DBSCAN (TDBSCAN) obstacle clustering algorithms, an improved DBSCAN algorithm based on distance-adaptive clustering radius (ADBSCAN) is designed, and a point cloud KD-Tree data structure is constructed to speed up the traversal of the algorithm; meanwhile, the OPTICS algorithm is introduced to enhance the performance of the proposed algorithm. Then, by adopting different fitting strategies for vehicle contour points in various states, the adaptability of the bounding box fitting algorithm is improved; Moreover, in view of the shortcomings of the poor robustness of the L-shape algorithm, the principal component analysis method (PCA) is introduced to obtain stable bounding box fitting results. Finally, considering the time-consuming and low-accuracy training of traditional machine learning algorithms, advanced PointNet in deep learning technique is built to send the point cloud within the bounding box of a high-confidence vehicle into PointNet to complete vehicle recognition. Experiments based on our autonomous driving perception platform and the KITTI dataset prove that the proposed method can stably complete vehicle target recognition and achieve a good balance between time-consuming and accuracy.

AB This work proposes the use of inductive links to wire-lessly power an autonomous sensor in a vehicle application. The selected application is intended for occupancy and belt detection in removable vehicle seats, where wiring the seat detectors from the vehicle chassis is impractical. The autonomous sensor includes seat detectors and a wireless transceiver to transfer the data on the state of detectors. To compensate the loose coupling between the coupled coils, resonant tanks were used. To drive the transmitting resonant network, a commercial class-D amplifier was used. Working frequency was restricted to 150 kHz. Commercial magnetic-core coils were selected as they provide high coil values and quality factors in a small-size factor, which is a requirement for the intended application. At the receiving network, a rectifier and a voltage regulator were used to provide dc voltage supply to the autonomous sensor. Three kinds of voltage regulators were compared from the point of view of the power efficiency. Both a theoretical analysis and experimental results are presented for different combinations of coils and working frequencies. Theoretical analysis shows that the operating points for the linear shunt regulator always lead to higher power efficiencies compared with other alternatives such as linear series and switching buck regulators. Experimental tests were carried out using a mechanical setup to fix the coil-to-coil distances. Experimental results agree with the theoretical analysis. Achieved power efficiencies ranged from around 50% to 10% for coil-to-coil distances from one to three times the inner diameter of the coils. Experimental tests also showed that the autonomous sensor was properly powered up to coil-to-coil distances of 2.5 cm, i.e., more than four times the inner diameter of the coils.

An adaptive controller is introduced based on a nonlinear model whose measurable output is corrupted by wave disturbances. Thus an observer is built to reconstruct the full states including wave velocity, wave motion displacement, vehicles velocity, position and rotation angle information which are used in the output feedback controller. Ultimate boundedness of the error signals is shown through Lyapunovs direct method. Finally, simulation studies for ODIN illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

LA English
DT Article
ID VEHICLE DYNAMICS
AB This paper presents the development of a controller for autonomous, steady-state cornering with rear tire saturation ("drifting") of a rear wheel drive vehicle. The controller is designed using a three-state vehicle model intended to balance simplicity and sufficient model fidelity. The model has unstable "drift equilibria" with large rear drive forces that induce deep rear tire saturation. The rear tire saturation at drift equilibria reduces vehicle stability but enables "steering" of the rear tire force through friction circle coupling of rear tire forces. This unique stability-controllability tradeoff is reflected in the controller design, through novel usage of the rear drive force for lateral control. An analytical stability guarantee is provided for the controller through a physically insightful invariant set around a desired drift equilibrium when operating in closed-loop. When implemented on a by-wire testbed, the controller achieves robust drifts on a surface with highly varying friction, suggesting that steady cornering with rear tire saturation can prove quite effective for vehicle trajectory control under uncertain conditions.

AB In this work, a novel single-level adaptive trajectory planner and tracking controller is developed for off-road autonomous vehicles operating on deformable terrains. Trajectory planning and tracking algorithms often rely on a simplified vehicle model to predict future vehicle states based upon control inputs, hence requiring accurate modeling and parameterization. On off-road deformable terrains this is a challenging task due to unknown terrain parameters and the complex interactions at tire-terrain interfaces, which pose issues in continuous differentiability, operating conditions, and computational time. To address these difficulties, in this paper, a neural network deformable terrain terramechanics model and its implementation within a terrain adaptive model predictive control algorithm is presented to improve vehicle safety and performance through more accurate prediction of the plant response. It is shown in simulations that the neural network is able to predict the lateral tire forces accurately and efficiently compared to the Soil Contact Model as a state-of-the-art model and is able to yield accurate bicycle model predictions. It is demonstrated that the implementation of the neural network within model predictive control can outperform both a baseline Pacejka-based and a rapidly exploring random tree controller by improving performance and allowing for more severe maneuvers to be completed that otherwise lead to failure when terrain deformations are not explicitly taken into account. The improved performance achieved through estimating terrain parameters online in an adaptive controller is highlighted against the nonadaptive realization. Finally, it is shown the algorithm is conducive to real-time implementation.

AB Self-localization is one of the most challenging problems for deploying micro autonomous underwater vehicles (mu AUV) in confined underwater environments. This paper extends a recently-developed self-localization method that is based on the attenuation of electro-magnetic waves, to the mu AUV domain. We demonstrate a compact, low-cost architecture that is able to perform all signal processing steps present in the original method. The system is passive with one-way signal transmission and scales to possibly large mu AUV fleets. It is based on the spherical localization concept. We present results from static and dynamic position estimation experiments and discuss the tradeoffs of the system.

AB This paper deals with autonomous vehicles. This could be considered a utopian goal nowadays but recent advances bring it closer than ever. Automation of the actuators involved in the management of a car, and control of the steering wheel constitute two of the most complex issues involved. We here describe an automatic power steering architecture to manage the steering wheel via an Ethernet controller. An on-board PC is connected to the controller to permit handling by computer generated signals. An electric car has been equipped with the system, and we present the results of tests of the behaviour of the system in real situations on the private driving circuit at the IAI facilities.

AB Although there is great media attention to connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and strong public interest in the technology, it is still under development. Their deployment to the broader public will require new regulations and road traffic rules that are also under development, and there is not yet a globally harmonized approach. This paper reviews the main safety and liability issues for CAVs with a focus on the rules developed for on-road testing to date in Australia, the United States, and Germany. It also reviews government policies from Victoria, Australia, and California, the United States, and it provides an appendix on European Union (E.U.) regulations. After a review of similarities and differences regarding safety and liability provisions, the study suggests how the current provisions can be brought together toward a globally harmonized approach to safety issues that builds on best practices in the three countries.

AB High driving efficiency remains challenging in autonomous electric vehicles, especially in small electric vehicle subtype. Here, we reported investigation of the structure and requirements of the drive system for those vehicles, while the motor-drive axle combined integrated driving scheme has been chosen. In the study, the power matching of drive motor as well as transmission ratio has been calculated based on the performance of the small electric vehicles, and the total gear ratio of 8.124 was determined. For better comprehensive performance and efficiency, the two-stage retarder has been designed, in which elements including high-speed shaft, low-speed shaft, gears, and differential have been examined to ensure their proof strength when the motor outputs reached the maximum torque. Notably, by utilizing topology optimization, Gear 4, the transmission unit with the heaviest weight percentage has been modified in a lightweight way, achieving a 41% reduction of the mass in emulation analysis and turned up to the target of optimization eventually.

AB The safety driving-related content demands of vehicle users increase rapidly, especially with the development of autonomous driving. It is significantly necessary to obtain the safety-related transportation information of an area when vehicles are drove there, whether or not they are controlled by human being. However, vehicular content caching can bring issues in distributed-fashion, such as high response delay and low content response ratio because of the poor traffic condition and the obstructions of buildings. As a consequence, we adopt UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) to assist the driving safety-related content caching for vehicles. Besides, since the power energy and the caching storage of UAVs are limited, it is needed to design an optimal caching scheme to guarantee the driving safety-related content demands of vehicle users as well as reduce the energy consumption of UAVs. In this article, we propose a novel deep Q-learning based air-assisted vehicular caching scheme to respond to the driving safety-related content requests of vehicle users. First, a three-layered content response architecture is introduced, where an airship is leveraged to take charge of the scheduling of UAVs to improve the content response. Then, a multi-objective mathematical model is built to describe the specific problem of the proposed scheme. Finally, deep Q-learning is applied to solve the multi-objective problem by learning from the history content requests of vehicle users. Extensive experiments have been conducted which show the proposed scheme outperforms its counterparts in terms of content hit ratio, response delay, being scheduling probability and packet buffering time.

AB Automated vehicles are expected to greatly boost traffic efficiency. However, how to estimate traffic breakdown probability for the mixed flow of autonomous vehicles and human driven vehicles around ramping areas remains to be answered. In this paper, we propose a stochastic temporal queueing model to reliably depict the queue dynamics of mixed traffic flow at ramping bottlenecks. The new model is a specified Newell's car-following model that allows two kinds of vehicle velocities and first-in-first-out (FIFO) queueing behaviors. The jam queue join time is supposed to be a random variable for human driven vehicles but a constant for automated vehicles. Different from many known models, we check the occurrence of significant velocity drop along the road instead of examining the duration of the simulated jam queue so as to avoid drawing the wrong conclusions of traffic breakdown. Monte Carlo simulation results show that the generated breakdown probability curves for pure human driven vehicles agree well with empirical observations. Having noticed that various driving strategy of automated vehicles exist, we carry out further analysis to show that the chosen car-following strategy of automated vehicles characterizes the breakdown probabilities. Further tests indicate that when the penetration rate of automated vehicles is larger than 20%, the traffic breakdown probability curve of the mixed traffic will be noticeably shifted rightward, if an appropriate car-following strategy is applied. This indicates the potential benefit of automated vehicles in improving traffic efficiency.

AB Using the Ethical Delphi method, this research seeks to understand how professionals relate to ethical sociospatial implications of possible widespread autonomous vehicle (AV) deployment in cities and societies, and to distil values that can shape AV futures. First, we sought to understand whether professionals engage in ethical thinking and reasoning regarding AV implementation, and the ethical considerations and values they use. We found that professionals give a range of arguments and rationales stemming from different value dimensions. Responses show evidence of engagement in ethical thinking, the use of ethical arguments, and an appeal to ethical values. Secondly, we mapped the value dimensions pertinent to AV implementation and ranked them to reflect their importance as perceived by respondents. Thirdly, we categorise the value dimensions into four groups: dominant, important but neglected, less prioritised, and less elucidated value dimensions, through which possible gaps in the conceptualisation of societal implications of AV implementation are brought to the fore. Finally, this study contributes our experience of applying the Ethical Delphi as a method for the ethical evaluation of novel (urban) technologies.

ID ROAD; SYSTEMS; DEFINITION
AB In this study we developed an autonomous braking algorithm to satisfy both safety and ride comfort of a vehicle. The proposed algorithm is composed of two-step braking strategies depending on the value of time-to-collision. The first step is a partial braking strategy to provide not only deceleration but also good ride comfort in a normal braking situation, and the second step is a full braking strategy to avoid forward collisions in an emergency braking situation. Further, the partial braking is divided into a recovery and a release zones. The former is to apply braking pressures for the safe deceleration, whereas the latter is to release the braking pressure smoothly for good ride comfort. To determine the partial braking pressures, the nonlinear characteristics of the tire friction is considered and the linear momentum of a preceding vehicle is calculated based on the extrapolation of its motion. Computer simulations using CarSim were executed combined with MATLAB/Simulink to implement the driving situations, and finally we obtained successful performances satisfying ride comfort as well as safety of the vehicle.

AB This paper presents a backstepping control method with an augmented observer for an autonomous lane keeping system. A novel reduced second-order model is also derived for an autonomous lane-keeping system. The proposed reduced model of lateral vehicle motion has the following advantages: (1) The lateral motion of the vehicle can be controlled with only simple linear second-order dynamics via the backstepping procedure; (2) The state variable of the reduced model includes the look-ahead distance similar to that for a human driver; (3) The system functions with unknown parameters and external disturbances can be lumped in the disturbance. An augmented observer is designed to estimate the full state and lumped disturbance, including the system functions with unknown parameters and external disturbances. A backstepping control is developed for improving the lateral control and compensation of the disturbance. The stability of the closed-loop system is demonstrated using the input-to-state stable property. The lateral control performance of the proposed method is validated via numerical simulations using CarSim and MATLAB/Simulink. (C) 2018 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article presents a nonlinear adaptive line-of-sight path following controller for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles in the presence of ocean currents. Firstly, a new nonsingular path following error kinematic model in the Serret-Frenet frame is developed, where a nominal course angle error is introduced to significantly simplify the guidance law design. Secondly, an adaptive line-of-sight guidance law with the introduction of the current observer is proposed to make the vehicle produce a variable sideslip angle to compensate for the drift force for any parametric curved-path path following. Benefit from the global -exponential convergence property of the designed current observer, the actual course angle error can be eliminated indirectly. Then, dynamic controller built on Lyapunov theory and backstepping technique guarantee the uniform global exponential stability of the yaw and relative surge velocity. In the end, stability analysis shows that the global -exponential stability is achieved for the closed-loop system. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB Automated vehicles rely on a precise intrinsic and extrinsic calibration of all sensors. An exact calibration leads to accurate localization and object detection results. Especially for sensor data fusion, the transformation between different sensor frames must be well known. Moreover, modular and redundant platforms require a large number of sensors to cover their full surroundings. This makes the calibration process complex and challenging. In this article, we describe the procedure to calibrate the full sensor setup of a modular autonomous driving platform, consisting of camera, lidar, and radar sensors, in four subsequent steps. At first, the intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters are determined. Afterwards, the transformation from lidar to camera on the one hand and from lidar to radar on the other hand is estimated. Lastly, the extrinsic calibration between all lidars and the vehicle frame is performed. In our evaluation, we show that these steps lead to an accurate calibration of the complete vehicle.

AB A critical problem in planning sampling paths for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is correctly balancing two issues. First, obtaining an accurate scalar field estimation and second, efficiently utilizing the stored energy capacity of the sampling vehicle. Adaptive sampling approaches can only provide solutions when real time and a priori environmental data is available. In this paper we present an analysis of adaptive sampling methodologies for AUVs. In particular, we analyze various sampling path strategies including systematic and stratified random patterns within a wide range of sampling densities and their impact in the energy consumption of the vehicle through a cost-evaluation function. Our study demonstrates that a systematic spiral sampling path strategy is optimal for high-variance scalar fields for all sampling densities and low-variance scalar fields when sampling is sparse. In addition, our results show that the random spiral sampling path strategy is found to be optimal for low-variance scalar fields when sampling is dense.

ID VARIABLE-SPEED LIMIT; POTENTIAL IMPACTS
AB Traffic management methods aim to increase the infrastructure's capacity to lower congestion levels. Using vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) connectivity technologies, connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to operate as actuators for traffic control. In this study, a CAV-based alternative approach for traffic management is proposed (SWSCAV), and its performance is compared to that of lane control signals (LCS) and variable speed limits (VSL), which are also traffic management systems. When a shockwave is detected due to an incident, the CAVs on the road slow until they reach the speed of the observed shockwave (SWS), according to this proposed procedure. Thus, the incoming traffic flow towards the incident is slowed, preventing the queue behind from extending. In a simulation of the urban mobility (SUMO) environment, the suggested method is evaluated for 4800 scenarios on a three-lane highway by varying the market penetration rate of CAVs in traffic flow, the control distances, the incident lane, and the duration. The proposed method reduces the incidence of density values of over 38 veh/km/lane and 28 veh/km/lane in the vicinity of the incident region by 12.68 and 8.15 percent, respectively. Even at low CAV market penetration rates, the suggested method reduces traffic density throughout the network and in the location of the incident site by twice as much as the LCS system application.(c) 2022 ISA.

AB This letter is the second report from a series of IEEE TIV's Decentralized and Hybrid Workshops (DHWs) on Intelligent Vehicles for Education (IV4E). It outlines the prospect of The Autonomous One (TAO), a future autonomous racing competition modeled after Formula One to advance IV4E by pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence. Existing autonomous races face challenges, including compromised fairness and low participant enthusiasm. These issues limit spectator engagement, thereby reducing the races' educational value. To prevent similar flaws in organizing TAO, our focus lies in setting governance rules from an organizer's perspective. In these DHWs, we analyzed the rules of existing autonomous races and suggested rule-making guidelines for TAO. To improve fairness, we recommend a balanced scoring system with rigorous monitoring of participating teams' performances. To discourage consistent victories by a single team, we suggest that leading teams share their source codes, thereby setting the championship-level performance as the baseline in the next season and accelerating the evolution of all participating teams' abilities. For enhancing suspense and spectator interest, an on-site adaptive rewarding scheme should be deployed to create thrilling turnarounds. Our strategies aim to maintain fairness, increase spectator interest, inspire competitiveness, and ultimately contribute to the advancement of IV4E in organizing TAO.

AB As an essential part of the emerging Internet of Things, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to reshape future transportation systems and change the commute style in people's everyday life. Among many vehicular on-board devices, radar system and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication system are two important pillars for the realization of CAVs. In this paper, the concept of coordinated CRC (C-CRC) is proposed to serve as a cognitive mediator for bridging vehicular radar and communication systems. By establishing a mutual-assistance relationship, C-CRC provides a new safety mechanism that allows one system to learn from and react to the risks that the other system has encountered. Simulation results have shown that the proposed method has desirable performance in face of motion perturbation and/or jamming attack under various scenarios.

AB Forecasting the motion of surrounding vehicles is necessary for an autonomous driving system applied in complex traffic. Trajectory prediction helps vehicles make more sensible decisions, which provides vehicles with foresight. However, traditional models consider the trajectory prediction as a simple sequence prediction task. The ignorance of inter-vehicle interaction and environment influence degrades these models in real-world datasets. To address this issue, we propose a novel Dynamic and Static Context-aware Attention Network named DSCAN in this paper. The DSCAN utilizes an attention mechanism to dynamically decide which surrounding vehicles are more important at the moment. We also equip the DSCAN with a constraint network to consider the static environment information. We conducted a series of experiments on a real-world dataset, and the experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our model. Moreover, the present study suggests that the attention mechanism and static constraints enhance the prediction results.

AB The paper addresses the problem of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) control in the absence of full state information. An application is made to the control of a prototype AUV in the vertical plane. The methodology adopted for controller design is nonlinear gain-scheduling control, whereby a set of linear, dynamic, reduced order output feedback controllers are designed and scheduled on the vehicle's forward speed. The paper summarizes the controller design steps, describes a technique for its practical implementation, and presents experimental results obtained with the INFANTE AUV during tests at sea.

AB This paper presents a cooperative/shared framework of the driver and his/her semi-autonomous vehicle in order to achieve desired steering performance. In particular, a copilot controller and the driver together operate and control the vehicle. Exploiting the classical small-gain theory, our proposed shared steering controller is developed independent of the unmeasurable internal states of the human driver, and only relies on his/her steering torque. Furthermore, by adopting data-driven adaptive dynamic programming and an iterative learning scheme, the shared steering controller is studied from the measurable data of the driver and the vehicle. Meanwhile, the accurate knowledge of the driver and the vehicle dynamics is unnecessary, which settles the problem of their potential parametric variations/uncertainties in practice. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by rigorous analysis and demonstrated by numerical simulations.

AB The deployment of a fleet of autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs) allows for the parallelisation of missions, intervehicle support for longer deployment times, adaptability and redundancy to in situ mission changes, and effective use of the right vehicle for the right purpose. End users and operators of AMVs face challenges in planning complex missions due to the limitations of their vehicles, dynamic, operationally constrictive, and unstructured environments, and in minimising risks to equipment, the mission, and personnel. Automated mission planning for AMV fleets can be a tool to reduce the complexity of programming vehicle tasking, and to perform validity assessments for end user-specified goals, allowing the operator to focus on risk assessment. We present a critical review of the current advances in automated planning for AMV fleets, investigating the limitations of available state-of-the-art tools and providing a road map of the goals and challenges based on analysis of field reports and end user initiatives.

AB This work introduces a scalable, cloud-agnostic and fault-tolerant data analytics platform for state-of-the-art autonomous systems that is built from open-source, reusable building blocks. As the baseline for further new reference architectures, it represents an architecture blueprint for processing, enriching and analyzing various feeds of structured and non-structured input data from advanced Internet-of-Things (IoT) based use cases. The platform builds on industry best practices, leverages on solid open-source components in a reusable fashion, and is based on our experience gathered from numerous IoT and Big Data research projects. The platform is currently used in the framework of the National Laboratory for Autonomous Systems in Hungary (abbreviated as ARNL). The platform is demonstrated through selected use cases from ARNL including the areas of smart/autonomous production systems (collaborative robotic assembly) and autonomous vehicles (mobile robots with smart vehicle control). Finally, we validate the platform through the evaluation of its streaming ingestion capabilities.

ID SPEED TRACKING
AB In the longitudinal control problem for automated heavy-duty vehicles, an important control objective is string stability, which ensures that errors decrease as they propagate upstream through the platoon. It is well known that when vehicles operate autonomously, string stability can be achieved by using speed-dependent spacing with constant time headway. However, this results in large steady-state intervehicle spacings, hence, decreased traffic throughput. This disadvantage is even more pronounced in heavy-duty vehicles, which require larger time headways due to their low actuation-to-weight ratio. In this paper, we develop two new nonlinear spacing policies - variable time headway and variable separation error gain - which all but eliminate this undesirable side effect. The first policy significantly reduces the transient errors and allows us to use much smaller spacings in autonomous platoon operation, while the second one results in smoother and more robust longitudinal control. Furthermore, the two can be combined to yield even better robustness, as is shown through our qualitative analysis.

AB Pedestrians' road-crossing behavior can be influenced by eHMIs (external Human-Machine Interfaces) on autonomous vehicles (AVs). In this research, we developed a novel eHMI concept that aimed to support pe-destrians' risk evaluation by displaying predicted real-time risk levels. In a virtual reality environment, we measured pedestrians' road-crossing behavior when they encountered AVs with this eHMI and manual-driven vehicles (MVs) in the same lane. Results showed that pedestrians exhibited typical crossing behaviors based on gap size for both vehicle types. In segregated traffic conditions, compared to MVs, eHMI-equipped AVs made pedestrians more sensitive to the changes in gap size by rejecting more small gaps and accepting more large gaps. Pedestrians also walked faster and kept larger safety margins for smaller gaps. Similar results were observed for AVs in mixed traffic conditions. However, in mixed traffic conditions, pedestrians faced more challenges when interacting with MVs as they tended to accept smaller gaps, walk more slowly, and maintain smaller safety margins. These findings indicate that dynamic risk information could be conducive to pedestrians' road-crossing behavior, but the use of eHMIs on AVs might disrupt pedestrians' interactions with MVs in complex traffic conditions. This potential risk shift among vehicles also poses the question of whether AVs should use segregated lanes to reduce their indirect impacts on pedestrian-MV interactions.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have led to innovative transformations in the transportation sector through convergence among automotive, intelligence, and information technologies. Given the fast pace of technological evolution, the technological development of CAVs is being intensively promoted by suppliers, including automakers and IT companies. Some studies have recently investigated the social and market acceptability of CAVs from the individual perspective. However, to our knowledge, none or few studies have focused on comparing the relative importance of value attributes that are likely to have a significant influence on market success in terms of both demand and supply. To bridge this research gap, we identify the perception differences in benefits and concerns of 98 individuals on the demand side and 46 experts on the supplier side using the analytic hierarchy process. The results revealed safety attributes as the most important benefit and concern in common. However, individuals rated driving and parking convenience, and financial burden more importantly, while experts gave higher priority to social advantages and social challenges.

The calculation of the voyage time is a difficult problem in the time-varying ocean, for the existing methods of the cooperating path planning, the computation time will increase exponentially as the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) counts increase, rendering them unfeasible. A collaborative path planning method is presehted for multi-AUV under the influence of time-varying ocean currents based on the dynamic programming algorithm. Each AUV cooperates with the one who has the longest estimated time of sailing, enabling the arrays of AUV to get their common goal in the shortest time with minimum time difference. At the same time, they could avoid the obstacles along the way to the target. Simulation results show that the proposed method has a promising applicability.

AB Detection of road boundaries and obstacles is essential for autonomous vehicle navigation. In this paper, we propose a road boundary and obstacle detection method using a downward-looking light detection and ranging sensor. This method extracts line segments from the raw data of the sensor in polar coordinates. After that, the line segments are classified into road and obstacle segments. To enhance the classification performance, the estimated roll and pitch angles of the sensor relative to the scanning road surface in the previous time step are then used. The classified road line segments are applied to track the road boundaries, roll, and pitch angles by using an integrated probabilistic data association filter. The proposed method was evaluated with the autonomous vehicle A1, which was the winner of the 2010 Autonomous Vehicle Competition in Korea organized by the Hyundai-Kia automotive group. The proposed method using the estimated roll and pitch angles can detect road boundaries and roadside, as well as road obstacles under various road conditions, including paved and unpaved roads and intersections.

AB Use of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) for last-mile transportation can improve transit use and reduce road congestion. We investigate the problem of optimal integration of SAVs with transit. By optimal, we mean that transit should be used instead of or to complement SAVs only when it reduces the total system travel time. Although greater use of transit reduces congestion, transit often increases travel time due to frequent stops and transfers. By using a continuous approximation to passenger and vehicle movements, we formulate the problem as a linear program using the link transmission model for traffic flow. One of the main challenges is associating passenger movement with vehicles that can have different destinations (e.g. a transit stop). Although the mathematical program is linear, it nevertheless has a large number of variables. We find a suboptimal solution using a rolling horizon method, which greatly reduces the required computation time. We also demonstrate an example of a possibly unfair passenger-to-vehicle ordering, and propose a first-come-first-served greedy algorithm to match passengers. A suite of experimental results on the Sioux Falls network show that using transit decreases total system travel time, especially when SAV fleet sizes are small. Transit also decreases the time travelers spend waiting, but tends to increase in-vehicle travel time. The methodology could be useful both for future SAV operators and for planners seeking to predict the effects of SAVs on traffic congestion.

AB Despite the advancements in the technologies of autonomous driving, it is still challenging to study the safety of a self-driving vehicle. Trajectory prediction is one core function of an autonomous vehicle. This study proposes an Attention-based Interaction-aware Trajectory Prediction (AI-TP) for traffic agents around the autonomous vehicle. With an encoder-decoder architecture, the AI-TP model uses Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to describe the interactions of traffic agents and Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (ConvGRU) to carry out predictions. Based on the attention mechanism, the AI-TP model constructs graphs from various traffic scenes to predict trajectories of different types of traffic agents. Traffic data from both the high-way (i.e., NGSIM) and urban road areas (i.e., ApolloScape and Argoverse) are used to evaluate the performance of the AI-TP model. Numerical results demonstrate that the AI-TP model requires less inference time and achieves better prediction accuracy than state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, the AI-TP model improves the performance with much less inference time on the NGSIM dataset, which shows the promise of predicting trajectories under various scenarios. The code of the AI-TP model will be available at https://github.com/KP-Zhang/AI-TP.

AB Deploying Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) is a necessity to enable a range of civilian/military underwater applications; yet, achieving a reliable coordination among the vehicles is a challenging issue due to the time- and space-varying characteristics of the acoustic communication channel. The design of a Medium Access Control (MAC) based on a probabilistic Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) method for short/medium distances (less than 2 km ) is presented. This method considers the inherent vehicle position uncertainty due to the inaccuracies in models and the drift of the vehicles. It minimizes the acoustic interference statistically by considering the angular position of neighboring vehicles via a two-step estimation and by keeping the transmitter antenna's beamwidth of each vehicle at an optimal value. Such value is chosen considering three contrasting goals, i.e.: (i) spreading the signal beam towards the vehicle to combat position uncertainty using a coarse estimation; (ii) focusing the beam to reduce acoustic energy dispersion through a fine estimation; and (iii) minimizing interference to other vehicles. Simulation results in a sparse underwater network show that this approach mitigates interference, reduces the probability of retransmission, and achieves higher data rates over conventional underwater MAC techniques.

AB Autonomous vehicles offer various advantages to both vehicle owners and automobile companies. However, despite the advantages, there are various risks associated with these vehicles. These vehicles interact with each other by forming a vehicular network, also known as VANET, in a centralized manner. This centralized network is vulnerable to cyber-attacks which can cause data loss, resulting in road accidents. Thus, to prevent the vehicular network from being attacked and to prevent the privacy of the data, key management is used. However, key management alone over a centralized network is not effective in ensuring data integrity in a vehicular network. To resolve this issue, various studies have introduced a blockchain-based approach and enabled key management over a decentralized network. This technique is also found effective in ensuring the privacy of all the stakeholders involved in a vehicular network. Furthermore, a blockchain-based key management system can also help in storing a large amount of data over a distributed network, which can encourage a faster exchange of information between vehicles in a network. However, there are certain limitations of blockchain technology that may affect the efficient working of autonomous vehicles. Most of the existing blockchain-based systems are implemented over Ethereum or Bitcoin. The transaction-processing capability of these blockchains is in the range of 5 to 20 transactions per second, whereas hashgraphs are capable of processing thousands of transactions per second as the data are processed exponentially. Furthermore, a hashgraph prevents the user from altering the order of the transactions being processed, and they do not need high computational powers to operate, which may help in reducing the overall cost of the system. Due to the advantages offered by a hashgraph, an advanced key management framework based on a hashgraph for secure communication between the vehicles is suggested in this paper. The framework is developed using the concept of Leaving of Vehicles based on a Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH) and Batch Rekeying. The system is tested and compared with other closely related systems on the basis of the transaction compilation time and change in traffic rates.

AB Considering the significant advancements in autonomous vehicle technology, research in this field is of interest to researchers. To drive vehicles autonomously, controlling steer angle, gas hatch, and brakes needs to be learned. The behavioral cloning method is used to imitate humans' driving behavior. We created a dataset of driving in different routes and conditions, and using the designed model, the output used for controlling the vehicle is obtained. In this paper, the learning of self-driving vehicles based on real driving behavior using deep neural network techniques (LSV-DNN) is proposed. We designed a convolutional network which uses the real driving data obtained through the vehicle's camera and computer. The response of the driver during driving is recorded in different situations, and by converting the real driver's driving video to images and transferring the data to an Excel file, obstacle detection is carried out with the best accuracy and speed using the Yolo algorithm version 3. This way, the network learns the response of the driver to obstacles in different locations and the network is trained with the Yolo algorithm version 3 and the output of obstacle detection. Then, it outputs the steer angle and amount of brake, gas, and vehicle acceleration. This study focuses on designing a convolutional network using behavioral cloning and motion planning of autonomous vehicle using a deep learning framework. Neural networks are effective systems for finding relationships between data, modeling, and predict new data or classify data. As a result Neural networks with input real data predict steer angle and speed for autonomous driving. The LSV-DNN is evaluated here via extensive simulations carried out in Python and TensorFlow environment. We evaluated the network error using the loss function. The results confirmed that our scheme is capable of exhibiting high prediction accuracy (exceeding 92.93%). In addition, our proposed scheme has high speed (more than 64.41%), low FPR (less than 6.89%), and low FNR (less than 3.95%), in comparison with the other approaches currently being employed. By comparing other methods which were conducted on the simulator's data, we obtained good performance results for the designed network on the data from KITTI benchmark, the data collected using a private vehicle, and the data we collected.

AB This study aimed to resolve a real-world traffic problem in a large-scale plant. Autonomous vehicle systems (AVSs), which are designed to use multiple vehicles to transfer materials, are widely used to transfer wafers in semiconductor manufacturing. Traffic control is a significant challenge with AVSs because all vehicles must be monitored and controlled in real time, to cope with uncertainties such as congestion. However, existing traffic control systems, which are primarily designed and controlled by human experts, are insufficient to prevent heavy congestion that impedes production. In this study, we developed a traffic control system based on machine learning predictions, and a routing method that dynamically determines AVS routes with reduced congestion rates. We predicted congestion for critical bottleneck areas, and utilized the predictions for adaptive routing control of all vehicles to avoid congestion. We conducted an experimental evaluation to compare the predictive performance of four popular algorithms. We performed a simulation study based on data from semiconductor fabrication to demonstrate the utility and superiority of the proposed method. The experimental results showed that AVSs with the proposed approach outperformed the existing approach in terms of delivery time, transfer time, and queuing time. We found that adopting machine learning-based traffic control can enhance the performance of existing AVSs and reduce the burden on the human experts who monitor and control AVSs.

ID COOPERATIVE CONTROL; DESIGN
AB In this paper, a finite-time containment robust control scheme is proposed for autonomous surface vehicle with input saturation constraint. Firstly, to achieve finite-time containment control, a saturated distributed equivalent control algorithm is proposed based on the position and velocity measurements of neighbors and a part of leaders; In light of the tools from algebraic graph theory and homogeneous theory, it is theoretically proven that all the follower will converge to the convex hull formed by the virtual leaders in finite-time; Then, in order to suppress the influence of external disturbance, a nonlinear integral sliding mode surface based on equivalent control law is designed. Combined with finite-time Lyapunov stability theory, a finite time cooperative control law is proposed, which makes the system tend to sliding surface in finite-time from any initial state; Finally, simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB This paper presents a novel attitude control design, which combines L-1 adaptive control and backstepping control together, for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in a highly dynamic and uncertain environment. The Euler angle representation is adopted in this paper to represent the attitude propagation. Kinematics and dynamics of the attitude are in the strict feedback form, which leads the backstepping control strategy serving as the baseline controller. Moreover, by bringing fast and robust adaptation into the backstepping control architecture, our controller is capable of dealing with time-varying uncertainties from modeling and external disturbances in dynamics. This attitude controller is proposed for coupled pitch-yaw channels. For inevitable roll excursions, a Lyapunov function-based optimum linearization method is presented to analyze the stability of the roll angle in the operation region. Theoretical analysis and simulation results are given to demonstrate the feasibility of the developed control strategy.

AB For the shortcomings of biologically inspired neural network algorithm in the path planning of robots, such as high computational complexity, long path planning time etc Glasius Bio-inspired Neural Network (GBNN) algorithm is proposed to improve the algorithm, and applied to the complete coverage path planning of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Firstly, the grid map is constructed by discretizing the two-dimensional underwater environment. Secondly, the corresponding dynamic neural network is built on the grid map. Finally, complete coverage path of AUV is planned based on the GBNN strategy and the path of AUV at the edge of obstacles is optimized by some typical path templates. The simulation results show that the AUV can completely cover the entire workspace and immediately escape from deadlocks without any waiting. Meanwhile, the efficiency of complete coverage path planning is high with short path planning time and low overlapping coverage rate by using the algorithm proposed in this paper.

AB A novel approach to the allocation of thruster forces of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is investigated. Generally, the number of thrusters in an AUV is more than what is minimally required to produce the desired motion. We investigate how to exploit the excess number of thrusters to accommodate thruster faults during operation. First, a redundancy resolution scheme is presented that takes into account the presence of excess number of thrusters along with any thruster faults and determines the reference thruster forces to produce the desired motion. These reference thruster forces are utilized in the controller to generate the required motion. This approach resolves the thruster redundancy in the Cartesian space and allows the AUV to track the task-space trajectories with asymptotic reduction of the task-space errors. Results from computer simulations are presented to demonstrate the viability of the proposed scheme. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study presents a closed-loop hierarchical control strategy for a group of connected and autonomous hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) with the purpose of optimising fuel economy while guaranteeing traffic mobility and vehicle safety. In the hierarchical control architecture, a decentralised stochastic model predictive control (SMPC)-based higher level controller incorporating signal phase and timing information is formulated to optimise the velocity profile of each vehicle, and an adaptive equivalent consumption minimisation strategy based lower level controller is employed for the energy management control of the HEVs. Creatively, random errors of the control variable are considered in the SMPC framework. The errors are discretised and modelled as a Markov process and the state transition matrix of the errors is generated randomly to capture the error transition dynamics. To solve the SMPC problem more efficiently, a scenario-based SMPC is employed. Moreover, the propulsion and recuperation efficiencies of the lower level controller are calculated at each time step with measurable variables, and fed back to the higher level controller for velocity optimisation in next time step. Simulation results validate the control effectiveness and advantages of the proposed control architecture.

   pose estimation; accuracy
AB To validate the accuracy and reliability of onboard sensors for object detection and localization for driver assistance, as well as autonomous driving applications under realistic conditions (indoors and outdoors), a novel tracking system is presented. This tracking system is developed to determine the position and orientation of a slow-moving vehicle during test maneuvers within a reference environment (e.g., car during parking maneuvers), independent of the onboard sensors. One requirement is a 6 degree of freedom (DoF) pose with position uncertainty below 5 mm (3 sigma), orientation uncertainty below 0.3 degrees (3 sigma), at a frequency higher than 20 Hz, and with a latency smaller than 500 ms. To compare the results from the reference system with the vehicle's onboard system, synchronization via a Precision Time Protocol (PTP) and system interoperability to a robot operating system (ROS) are achieved. The developed system combines motion capture cameras mounted in a 360 degrees panorama view setup on the vehicle, measuring retroreflective markers distributed over the test site with known coordinates, while robotic total stations measure a prism on the vehicle. A point cloud of the test site serves as a digital twin of the environment, in which the movement of the vehicle is visualized. The results have shown that the fused measurements of these sensors complement each other, so that the accuracy requirements for the 6 DoF pose can be met while allowing a flexible installation in different environments.

DE autonomous vehicle; path planning; RRT-Dijkstra-based strategy
ID FRAMEWORK
AB It is challenging to plan paths for autonomous vehicles on half-structured roads because of the vast planning area and complex environmental constraints. This work aims to plan optimized paths with high accuracy and efficiency. A two-step path planning strategy is proposed. The classic planning problem is divided into two simpler planning problems: reduction problems for a vast planning area and solving problems for weighted directed graphs. The original planning area is first reduced using an RRT (Rapidly Exploring Random Tree) based guideline planner. Second, the path planning problem in the smaller planning region is expanded into a weighted directed graph and transformed into a discrete multi-source cost optimization problem, in which a potential energy field based discrete cost assessment function was designed considering obstacles, lanes, vehicle kinematics, and collision avoidance performances, etc. The output path is then obtained by applying a Dijkstra optimizer. Comparative simulations are conducted to assess the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The results shows that the designed strategy balances efficiency and accuracy with enough planning flexibility and a 22% improvement in real-time performance compared to the classic Lattice planner, without significant loss of accuracy.

AB Research in the field of scientific Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) has been underway for over three decades. Much of the original work was funded by the military, and the vehicles were intended for Naval Ordnance Systems Command oceanographic needs, although the payloads were for general scientific use. Over the last decade, several autonomous underwater vehicles have been purpose built for both the science community and industrial operations around the world. Because of the variety of mission requirements, AUV configurations and options available today are numerous.
   Beginning with a brief overview of the history of AUVs for science, the paper continues with discussion of the ocean applications that are suitable to AUVs. Highlighted are some points a potential user might consider when selecting an AUV for a particular science application. An overview of several AUVs available today has been included exploring the cross-section of capabilities offered. This leads into the emerging requirements for AUVs of the future. In conclusion, some insight is given on lessons learned by several members of the oceanographic AUV community and how these lessons might be applicable when considering AUVs as a solution to today's intriguing oceanographic science questions.

AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology started to shift the perception of the transportation systems. However, for AVs to operate at their optimum capabilities, they need to go through a comprehensive testing and verification process. While a large amount of research and funding has been provided for solving this problem, there is still a lack of a systematic method to develop standardized tests that can be used to judge if the decision-making capability functions are within acceptable parameters. To that end, the tests need to cover all possible situations that an AV may run into. This paper focuses on defining the notion of coverage mathematically when using pseudo-randomly generated simulations for testing. The approach defines new equivalence relations between scenes, which are the systems' various states, to achieve this goal. Considering the substantial need for computation, even with the obtained coverage, we also introduce the mathematical definition of a sub-scene and additional strategies, such as expanding the equivalence classes of scenes and combining actors in scenes, to reduce the amount of testing required to certify AVs.

ID ROBOTICS
AB Autonomous driving approaches today are mainly based on perception-planning-action modular pipelines and the End2End paradigm respectively. The End2End paradigm is a strategy that directly maps raw sensor data to vehicle control actions. This strategy is very promising and appealing because complex module design and cumbersome data labeling are avoided. Since this approach lacks a degree of interpretability, safety and practicability. we propose an autonomous driving approach based on trajectory learning using deep neural networks in this paper. In comparison to End2End algorithm, it is found that the trajectory learning algorithm performs better in autonomous driving. As for trajectory learning algorithm, the CNN_Raw-RNN network structure is established, which is verified to be more effective than the original CNN_LSTM network structure. Besides, we propose an autonomous driving architecture of a pilot and copilot combination. The pilot is responsible for trajectory prediction via imitation learning with labeled driving trajectories, while the copilot is a safety module that is employed to verify the effectiveness of the vehicle trajectory by the results of the semantic segmentation auxiliary task. The proposed autonomous driving architecture is verified with a real car on urban roads without manual intervention within 40 km.

AB Understanding the intentions of drivers at intersections is a critical component for autonomous vehicles. Urban intersections that do not have traffic signals are a common epicenter of highly variable vehicle movement and interactions. We present a method for predicting driver intent at urban intersections through multi-modal trajectory prediction with uncertainty. Our method is based on recurrent neural networks combined with a mixture density network output layer. To consolidate the multi-modal nature of the output probability distribution, we introduce a clustering algorithm that extracts the set of possible paths that exist in the prediction output and ranks them according to probability. To verify the method's performance and generalizability, we present a real-world dataset that consists of over 23 000 vehicles traversing five different intersections, collected using a vehicle-mounted lidar-based tracking system. An array of metrics is used to demonstrate the performance of the model against several baselines.

AB The stability of autonomous vehicle platoons with limits on acceleration and deceleration is determined. If the leading-vehicle acceleration remains within the limits, all vehicles in the platoon remain within the limits when the relative-velocity feedback coefficient is equal to the headway time constant [k = 1/h]. Furthermore, if the sensitivity alpha > 1/h, no collisions occur. String stability for small perturbations is assumed and the initial condition is taken as the equilibrium state. Other values of k and alpha that give stability with no collisions are found from simulations. For vehicles with non-negligible mechanical response, simulations indicate that the acceleration-feedback-control gain might have to be dynamically adjusted to obtain optimal performance as the response time changes with engine speed. Stability is demonstrated for some perturbations that cause initial acceleration or deceleration greater than the limits, yet do not cause collisions. (C) 2014 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

AB While public transportation (PT) plays a critical role in urban mobility, the discomfort and the disutility of the last-mile trips make PT unattractive. We study the feasibility of shared autonomous vehicles (AV) as an on-demand alternative to fixed-route buses for last-mile travel. To this end, the bus routes that operate along the edges of the PT network in Bursa, Turkey are selected. The origin and destination (OD) pairs of the trips made on these bus routes are inferred at an individual level. The vehicle routing problem is then formulated by consid-ering the proposed transportation service. Several solution methods are developed for both solution construction and solution improvement phases of the problem. To assess solution methods with real-world data, an agent-based simulation framework is built. It is found that the solution methods successfully solved a dynamic prob-lem. The results show that the integration of PT using AVs is well-suited to improve the service quality and energy efficiency in the last-mile mobility.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) are a critical part of recent progressive marine technologies. Their development demands the capability of optical systems to understand and interpret the surrounding landscape. This capability plays an important role in the navigation of coastal areas a safe distance from land, which demands sophisticated image segmentation algorithms. For this purpose, some solutions, based on traditional image processing and neural networks, have been introduced. However, the solution of traditional image processing methods requires a set of parameters before execution, while the solution of a neural network demands a large database of labelled images. Our new solution, which avoids these drawbacks, is based on adaptive filtering and progressive segmentation. The adaptive filtering is deployed to suppress weak edges in the image, which is convenient for shoreline detection. Progressive segmentation is devoted to distinguishing the sky and land areas, using a probabilistic clustering model to improve performance. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a set of images acquired from the vehicle's operative camera were utilised. The results demonstrate that the proposed method performs with high accuracy regardless of distance from land or weather conditions.

ID APPEARANCE
AB Autonomous ground vehicles are increasingly finding their way into real-life applications, ranging from food/parcel delivery to self-driving vehicles. Given that, understanding the behaviours and intentions of humans are still one of the main challenges autonomous ground vehicles faced with. More specifically, when it comes to complex environments such as urban traffic scenes, inferring the intentions and actions of vulnerable road users such as pedestrians become even harder. In this paper, we address the problem of intent action prediction of pedestrians in urban traffic environments using only image sequences from a monocular RGB camera. We propose a real-time framework that can accurately detect, track and predict the intended actions of pedestrians based on a tracking-by-detection technique in conjunction with a novel spatio-temporal DenseNet model. We trained and evaluated our framework based on real data collected from urban traffic environments. Our framework has shown resilient and competitive results in comparison to other baseline approaches. Overall, we achieved an average precision score of 84.76% with a real-time performance at 20 FPS.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are becoming increasingly popular for ocean exploration, military and industrial applications. In particular, AUVs are becoming an attractive option for underwater search and survey operations as they are inexpensive compared to manned vehicles. Previous attempts on AUV designs have focused primarily on functional designs while very little research has been directed to identify optimum designs. This paper presents an optimization framework for the design of AUVs using two state-of-the-art population based optimization algorithms, namely non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and infeasibility driven evolutionary algorithm (IDEA). The framework is subsequently used to identify the optimal design of a torpedo-shaped AUV with an overall length of 1.3 m. The preliminary design identified through the process of optimization is further analyzed with the help of a computer-aided design tool, CATIA to generate a detailed design. The detailed design has since then been built and is currently undergoing trials. The flexibility of the proposed framework and its ability to identify optimum preliminary designs of AUVs with different sets of user requirements are also demonstrated. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Vehicle automation is a revolutionary trend in urban mobility, and robotaxi-that is, a service providing shared autonomous vehicles (AVs)-are expected to reduce energy consumption and hinder the growth of car ownership. This study investigates consumers' intention to use robotaxi and to buy AVs, particularly focusing on the roles of perceived benefits to multiple stakeholders (i.e., users and pedestrians) and consumers' environmental awareness in the adoption process. Based on a nationwide survey in China, our empirical analysis reveals the following important findings: (1) users' perceptions of the benefits of AVs for pedestrians and users influence their attitude toward and intention to use robotaxi and to buy AVs; (2) perceived drawbacks are negatively related to intention to buy AVs and to use robotaxi, but not to attitude toward AVs; (3) attitude positively predicts intention to use robotaxi, but not intention to buy AVs; (4) intention to use robotaxi is positively associated with intention to buy AVs; (5) incorporating the perceived benefits of AVs for pedestrians significantly improves the behavioral model; and (6) environmental awareness strengthens the positive influence of perceived benefits on attitude, and exacerbates the negative association between perceived drawbacks and intention to use robotaxi. We contribute to the literature on AV adoption by furthering understanding of the influence of benefits to multiple stakeholders and environmental awareness; we also present key business and policy implications relating to facilitating the transition of AVs.

AB Balancing two-wheeled autonomous vehicles at low forward speeds is one of the primary challenges in the development of such vehicles. Gyrostabilizers can be used as actuators to make the balance; however, conventional gyros are not typically able to maintain constant moments and directions to stabilize against constant 'heel'. In this paper, we present an innovative gyrostabilizer including a twin flywheel arrangement that can provide any desired gyroscopic roll moment. The dynamical model of a bicycle together with the gyrostabilizer is derived using Newton-Euler method. The actuator dynamics is included when designing the control system. A robust non-integer sliding mode controller is then developed to guarantee perfect trajectory tracking in the presence of roll disturbance. Extensive comparative simulations (based on the experimentally measured parameters of a typical bike) are conducted to evaluate the method and to show the impact of introducing the novel actuator. Results demonstrate that the proposed system offers superior performance while the control effort also remains within the capacity of normal actuators. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We study an autonomous transport service for population where users buy future time slots in which they are guaranteed service. A bilevel fleet sizing-vehicle routing-time slot pricing model, sensitive to users' activity scheduling decisions in the lower level is developed. Upper level model is solved using Bender's decomposition and the results are sent to lower level finding an equilibrium using the values of willingness to pay by population under different pricing mechanisms. The values of willingness to pay and the reservation of vehicles among users depends on the fleet size and routing/scheduling results obtained from the upper level model, where spatial temporal distribution of the demand for ride by users impacts the solution to fleet sizing problem. Numerical models are used to explain the methods, to test scalability of the proposed solution algorithms, and to illustrate the potential application of the proposed formulation in simultaneous assessment and modeling of population behavior and optimum fleet sizing model.

AB Using the bilevel optimization (BIO) scheme, this paper presents a time-optimal path planner for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operating in grid-based environments with ocean currents. In this scheme, the upper optimization problem is defined as finding a free-collision channel from a starting point to a destination, which consists of connected grids, and the lower optimization problem is defined as finding an energy-optimal path in the channel generated by the upper level algorithm. The proposed scheme is integrated with ant colony algorithm as the upper level and quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization as the lower level and tested to find an energy-optimal path for AUV navigating through an ocean environment in the presence of obstacles. This arrangement prevents discrete state transitions that constrain a vehicle's motion to a small set of headings and improves efficiency by the usage of evolutionary algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed BIO scheme has higher computation efficiency with a slightly lower fitness value than sliding wavefront expansion scheme, which is a grid-based path planner with continuous motion directions.

AB This study proposes a novel integrated local trajectory planning and tracking control (ILTPTC) framework for autonomous vehicles driving along a reference path with obstacles avoidance. For this ILTPTC framework, an efficient state-space sampling-based trajectory planning scheme is employed to smoothly follow the reference path. A model based predictive path generation algorithm is applied to produce a set of smooth and kinematically-feasible paths connecting the initial state with the sampling terminal states. A velocity control law is then designed to assign a speed value at each of the points along the generated paths. An objective function considering both safety and comfort performance is carefully formulated for assessing the generated trajectories and selecting the optimal one. For accurately tracking the optimal trajectory while overcoming external disturbances and model uncertainties, a combined feedforward and feedback controller is developed. Both simulation analyses and vehicle testing are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ILTPTC framework, and future research is also briefly discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recently, research on the hardware system for generating point cloud data through 3D LiDAR scanning has improved, which has important applications in autonomous driving and 3D reconstruction. However, point cloud data may contain defects such as duplicate points, redundant points, and an unordered mass of points, which put higher demands on the performance of hardware systems for processing data. Simplifying and compressing point cloud data can improve recognition speed in subsequent processes. This paper studies a novel algorithm for identifying vehicles in the environment using 3D LiDAR to obtain point cloud data. The point cloud compression method based on the nearest neighbor point and boundary extraction from octree voxels center points is applied to the point cloud data, followed by the vehicle point cloud identification algorithm based on image mapping for vehicle recognition. The proposed algorithm is tested using the KITTI dataset, and the results show improved accuracy compared to other methods.

AB An autonomous measurement outlier detection and exclusion framework for ground vehicle navigation using cellular signals is developed. The ground vehicle aids its onboard inertial measurement unit (IMU) with cellular signals in a tightly-coupled fashion in the absence of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals. First, cellular pseudoranges are characterized from an extensive wardriving campaign collected with a ground vehicle in different environments: open sky, urban, and deep urban. Then, a framework is developed, which accounts for outliers due to line-of-sight blockage and short multipath delays. These outliers induce biases in cellular pseudoranges and compromise the integrity of the navigation solution. Experimental results are presented evaluating the efficacy of the proposed framework on a ground vehicle navigating in the absence of GNSS signals. The results demonstrate the proposed framework detecting and excluding outliers, reducing the position root mean squared error (RMSE) by 41.5% and the maximum position error by 43.1%.

AB Most of the existing research in the field of autonomous vehicles (AVs) addresses decision making, planning and control as separate factors which may affect AV performance in complex driving environments. A hierarchical framework is proposed in this paper to address the problem mentioned above in environments with multiple lanes and surrounding vehicles. Firstly, high-level decision making is implemented by a finite-state machine (FSM), according to the relative relationship between the ego vehicle (EV) and the surrounding vehicles. After the decision is made, a cluster of quintic polynomial equations is established to generate the path connecting the initial position to the candidate target positions, according to the traffic states of the EV and the target vehicle. The optimal path is selected from the cluster, based on the quadratic programming (QP) framework. Then, the speed profile is generated, based on the longitudinal displacement-time graph (S-T graph), considering the vehicle motion state constraints and collision avoidance. The smoothed speed profile is created through another QP formulation, in the space created by the dynamic-programming (DP) method. Finally, the planned path and speed profile are combined and sent to the lower level control module, which consists of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for lateral trajectory tracking control, and a double PID controller for longitudinal control. The performance of the proposed framework was validated in a co-simulation environment using PreScan, MATLAB/Simulink and CarSim, and the results demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of addressing most ordinary scenarios on a structured road, with reasonable decisions and controlling abilities.

AB A common maneuver drivers perform and experience on the road is changing lanes. Autonomous vehicles are required to engage a lane change safely and to react to the other road users' lane changes. To develop autonomous vehicles that change lanes or respond to the lead vehicle's lane changes in a safe and human-like way, one should investigate the factors that affect human driver responses. By reviewing the literature to identify potential factors, this study extracted these factors from a naturalistic driving data set and associated them with driver deceleration and acceleration responses to the lead vehicle's cut-in and cut-out to develop predictive models for the impact of the events on traffic flow. After the events were verified as accurate, the variables associated with the events, including range, range rate, speed, lateral position in the lane, and average acceleration were analyzed using logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), and two forms of decision trees. In total, 799 cut-in events and 684 cut-out events with the necessary variables were applied for analysis. The significant variables influencing driver behavior were found, and using these variables, the predictive models achieved around 80% accuracy for cut-ins, and 73% accuracy for cut-outs on test data. These results will assist in the future design of autonomous vehicle control to minimize detrimental effects on traffic when changing lanes and safe longitudinal control when responding to a lead vehicle's lane changes, allowing for safe integration with human drivers, and better design of driver assistance systems.

AB Vehicle detection and tracking play an important role in autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems. Adverse weather conditions such as the presence of heavy snow, fog, rain, dust or sandstorm situations are dangerous restrictions on camera's function by reducing visibility, affecting driving safety. Indeed, these restrictions impact the performance of detection and tracking algorithms utilized in the traffic surveillance systems and autonomous driving applications. In this article, we start by proposing a visibility enhancement scheme consisting of three stages: illumination enhancement, reflection component enhancement, and linear weighted fusion to improve the performance. Then, we introduce a robust vehicle detection and tracking approach using a multi-scale deep convolution neural network. The conventional Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density filter based tracker is utilized jointly with hierarchical data associations (HDA), which splits into detection-to-track and track-to-track associations. Herein, the cost matrix of each phase is solved using the Hungarian algorithm to compensate for the lost tracks caused by missed detection. Only detection information (i.e., bounding boxes with detection scores) is used in HDA without visual features information for rapid execution. We have also introduced a novel benchmarking dataset designed for research in applications of autonomous vehicles under adverse weather conditions called DAWN. It consists of real-world images collected with different types of adverse weather conditions. The proposed method is tested on DAWN, KITTI, and MS-COCO datasets and compared with 21 vehicle detectors. Experimental results have validated effectiveness of the proposed method which outperforms state-of-the-art vehicle detection and tracking approaches under adverse weather conditions.

AB This article presents novel distributed prescribed performance control for three-dimension (3D) time-varying formation of multiple underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with uncertain dynamics and unknown disturbances. Different from the regular prescribed performance function, a novel form of prescribed performance function is proposed such that the time desired for the formation errors of AUVs to reach and stay within the prescribed tolerant band can be preset exactly and flexibly. Furthermore, a simple error mapping function is constructed to transform the formation errors constrained by the prescribed performance into the unconstrained transformed errors. With the aid of radial basis function neural networks, the uncertain item lumped by uncertain dynamics and unknown disturbances of AUVs is artfully converted into a linearly parametric form with only a single unknown parameter. Based on the above, a robust adaptive 3D time-varying formation control law of AUVs is developed incorporating a second-order sliding mode differentiator into the backstepping method. The theoretical analysis and simulation results validate our developed formation control scheme.

DT Article
AB The safety issue has become a critical obstacle that cannot be ignored in the marketization of autonomous vehicles (AVs). The objective of this study is to explore the mechanism of AV-involved crashes and analyze the impact of each feature on crash severity. We use the Apriori algorithm to explore the causal relationship between multiple factors to explore the mechanism of crashes. We use various machine learning models, including support vector machine (SVM), classification and regression tree (CART), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), to analyze the crash severity. Besides, we apply the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to interpret the importance of each factor. The results indicate that XGBoost obtains the best result (recall = 75%; G-mean = 67.82%). Both XG Boost and Apriori algorithm effectively provided meaningful insights about AV-involved crash characteristics and their relationship. Among all these features, vehicle damage, weather conditions, accident location, and driving mode are the most critical features. We found that most rear-end crashes are conventional vehicles bumping into the rear of AVs. Drivers should be extremely cautious when driving in fog, snow, and insufficient light. Besides, drivers should be careful when driving near intersections, especially in the autonomous driving mode.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore consumers' understanding of autonomous driving by comparing perceptions of occasional drivers (ODs) and frequent drivers (FDs).
   Design/methodology/approach -Data were gathered through semi-structured interviews with 41 drivers. Their responses were categorized into thematic categories or topics on the basis of content analysis, and the topics were structured based on the core-periphery model. Finally, the authors visualized the structure on a perceptual map by adopting a maximum tree approach. Findings - Respondents' understanding of autonomous driving were categorized into 10 topics. There were significant differences in topics and their relationships between ODs and FDs.
   Findings also show that FD can better detect hazardousness from autonomous driving environments than ODs.
   Research limitations/implications - Differently from prior studies' focus on its technological aspect and some derived benefits, the study examines it from the viewpoint of consumers, who are critical participants in the dissemination of autonomous driving.
   Practical implications - The findings suggest that rather than focusing on developing the highest level of autonomous cars, developing in an evolutionary way by adding automated functions to existing cars can be the better strategy to dominate the autonomous vehicle market.
   Originality/value - This study is a pioneering work in that it can be an initial empirical work on autonomous driving from the customer standpoint.

A fuzzy-reasoning-based general technique fcr edge detection is used to classify a pixel in an image into a border region or a uniform region based on luminance differences between this pixel and its neighboring pixels. The idea of this paper is to integrate special knowledge about white line markings into a fuzzy rule base using this general technique. The method is implemented on the THMR-III mobile robot, and experiments show that this method is robust to noise and environment changes. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Pedestrian detection is at the core of autonomous road vehicle navigation systems as they allow a vehicle to understand where potential hazards lie in the surrounding area and enable it to act in such a way that avoids traffic-accidents, which may result in individuals being harmed. In this work, a review of the convolutional neural networks (CNN) to tackle pedestrian detection is presented. We further present models based on CNN and transfer learning. The CNN model with the VGG-16 architecture is further optimised using the transfer learning approach. This paper demonstrates that the use of image augmentation on training data can yield varying results. In addition, a pre-processing system that can be used to prepare 3D spatial data obtained via LiDAR sensors is proposed. This pre-processing system is able to identify candidate regions that can be put forward for classification, whether that be 3D classification or a combination of 2D and 3D classifications via sensor fusion. We proposed a number of models based on transfer learning and convolutional neural networks and achieved over 98% accuracy with the adaptive transfer learning model.

DE Autonomous vehicles; Vehicle dynamics; Road following; Guidance control;
   RISE control; Overtaking
AB Vehicle lane-changing and overtaking are fundamental technology in autonomous driving. This paper proposes an approach that combines guidance navigation and image based visual detection for road following and overtaking maneuver. Two critical issues are considered: Firstly, it is suggested to design a robust constrained road following based line of sight guidance in the presence of unknown time-varying sideslip angle and under unknown dynamic model. Secondly, to trigger the autonomous overtaking manoeuvre. An overtaking procedure is defined as a high-priority task while the road following as a low-priority task. The objective is then to properly switching between the two guidance modes according to the camera vision reading. The adopted control strategy consists of a constrained along and cross-track control law and a nonlinear RISE control law. The closed-loop dynamics of both kinematic errors and the dynamical errors are analyzed in detail using nonlinear interconnected systems theory and the overall system is shown to be input to state stable (ISS). The proposed approach for road following and overtaking are validated in simulations.

AB The introduction and adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs) will likely reshape the transportation system and many economic activities. The economic literature on technology adoption, based on studies in agriculture and other sectors, provides lessons on the diffusion of AVs and its social and economic impacts. We rely on the threshold model of diffusion, where heterogeneous agents make decisions pursuing their self-interests. Applications of the threshold model point to case studies of other technologies where one can gain information and make predictions about the future of AVs. We find that private ownership of AVs may prevail after a transition period, as was the case in other technologies like computers, tractors, and conventional vehicles. With technological progress, the cost of privately owning AVs may decline. Further, there will be an increase in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per capita, there may be more vehicles on the road, and perhaps the transportation user-base will expand to include those currently facing limited mobility. Congestion is likely to depend on the tradeoff between the expansion of VMT and increased efficiency of AVs to communicate and help regulate traffic. Furthermore, differentiation of vehicles will increase as driving time becomes freed for other activities. These trends may lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions and expansion of the transportation sector. Finally, the technology will evolve and may result in complementary innovations needing to be addressed, including the "last 10 feet" problem. It is evident that the future of the transportation system governed by AVs is most likely not going to be sustainable. This necessitates the importance of developing and enforcing rigorous policies at the metropolitan level and TNC levels to ensure a sustainable evolution of the future of transportation mobility.

DE Automotive engineering; Autonomous vehicle navigation; localization;

AB A low-cost automotive radar is often used in autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems. However, the low cost radar often assumes all detected objects to be on the ground plane when estimating radar/vehicle ego-velocity, but when there are elevated background objects present, such as buildings and tall trees, the ego-velocity estimation tends to be biased. Here we analyze the source of estimation error and develop a new algorithm to recognize three types of object reflections using the discrepancy between the estimated ego-velocity and the measured Doppler velocity. We propose an elevation and background aware cost (EBAC) function to formulate an optimization framework which can distinguish the object types to improve ego-velocity estimation. We combine a robust estimation method with the optimization framework to handle outliers in radar readings. We have implemented the algorithm and tested it in both simulation and physical experiments using our autonomous vehicle. The results show that our estimation method significantly reduces ego-velocity estimation error while maintaining a smaller error variance without losing robustness. More specifically, it reduces the ego-velocity estimation error by 49% in the most common driving scenario.

AB Path tracking control is one of the most important functions for autonomous driving. In path tracking control, high accuracy and smooth tracking are required for safe and comfort driving. In order to meet these requirements, model predictive control approaches, which can obtain an optimized solution with respect to a predefined path, have been widely studied. Conventional predictive controllers have been studied based on a simple bicycle model. However, the conventional predictive controllers have a performance limitation in practical challenges due to the difference between the simple bicycle model and the actual vehicle. To overcome this limitation, the actuator dynamics of the steering system should be incorporated into the control design. In this paper, we propose a model predictive control based path tracking control algorithm to achieve the accurate and smooth tracking by incorporating the dynamic characteristics of the steering actuation system. In the proposed control algorithm, an optimal trajectory of the steering command is calculated by applying a quadratic programming optimization method. The proposed controller was verified by computer simulation with various driving scenarios. The simulation results show that the proposed controller can improve the tracking performance.

AB An autonomous vehicle sideslip angle estimation algorithm is proposed based on consensus and vehicle kinematics/dynamics synthesis. Based on the velocity error measurements between the reduced Inertial Navigation System (R-INS) and the global navigation satellite system (GNSS), a velocity-based Kalman filter is formalized to estimate the velocity errors, attitude errors, and gyro bias errors of the R-INS. The observability issue of the heading error, which affects sideslip estimation, is analyzed. Then, to enhance the observability and improve the estimation accuracy of the heading error under normal driving conditions, a consensus Kalman information filter is developed to synthesize the vehicle kinematics and dynamics and estimate the heading error. Within the developed consensus framework, one node augments a novel heading error measurement from a linear vehicle-dynamic-based sideslip estimator and another node adopts the heading error from the GNSS course. Next, based on the vehicle lateral excitation level, a weighting scheme is proposed to fuse the error state estimates from the velocity-based and consensus Kalman state observers. The stability of the proposed state observers is also investigated. Comprehensive experimental studies, including critical slalom, slight/normal double lane change, and normal driving maneuvers, were conducted to verify the proposed estimation framework; they confirm the reliability and accuracy of the estimator in various automated driving conditions even in comparison with state-of-the-art methods that utilize more measurements (dual-antenna GNSS). Also, this novel multisensor framework is extendable to leverage speed information from other sensors such as cameras and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to increase reliability and accuracy.

AB The development of edge computing based autonomous and connected vehicles (CAVs) provides a very promising solution for the construction of intelligent transportation system. Unfortunately, the existing methods are difficult to predict traffic flow accurately in such case due to not only the dynamic nature of the CAVs but also the considerable amount of missing traffic flow data. Based on this, we propose an online rolling traffic flow prediction method to provide support for the CAVs can be seen into practice. The new matrix factorization techniques proposed can learn the low-dimensional embeddings in the online setting and impute missing ones simultaneously. Moreover, instead of directly predicting the high-dimensional traffic flow data, a standard vector autoregressive (VAR) process is employed on low-dimensional embeddings to predict future values. Further, a multidimensional Cadzow method is proposed to solve the coefficient matrices of VAR efficiently even if there is noise. The simulation results on two real datasets show the applicability of the proposed method to online traffic flow prediction for edge computing-enhanced CAVs.

AB It has long been understood that swimming marine animals have evolved capabilities in terms of speed, manoeuvrability, and efficiency which are desirable for underwater vehicles. Despite this, solutions inspired by nature, or bio-inspiration, are very rarely applied to solve engineering challenges. In particular, it is understood that fish have the ability to alter their mode of swimming to interact with naturally produced vortices as a method of conserving energy and in certain instances extracting energy from a flow. This paper considers whether a bio-inspired flexible autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) could exploit unsteady flow features to reduce its cost of transport. An analytical model is developed which allows an AUV designer to predict which flow frequencies excite the natural vibration modes of a flexible cylinder. It is demonstrated that by placing a flexible cylinder in an unsteady flow, such as downstream of a bluff body, a similar mechanism to that used by fish may be exploited to move the cylinder upstream with no power input except that extracted from the flow.

AB Autonomous driving has received much attention in the last decade as a key component of intelligent transportation, and vehicle detection serves as a fundamental task for autonomous driving. Although recent learning-based methods have achieved great advances in terms of accuracy, these methods are usually computationally expensive and cannot be deployed on resource-limited devices. To address this limitation, in this paper, we aim to develop an efficient yet highly accurate vehicle detection method by tailoring a network quantization method. Due to the small objects and diverse scenarios in the real world, we introduce learnable scale parameters for network quantization to achieve flexible adaption. Ablation study is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. In addition, extensive experiments are conducted on the UA-DETRAC and KITTI datasets for performance evaluation. Compared to previous generic network quantization methods, our method produces significantly better performance. Moreover, our quantized network surpasses previous lightweight vehicle detection methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, establishing a new baseline for vehicle detection.

AB Blind intersections have high accident rates due to the poor visibility of oncoming traffic, high traffic speeds, and lack of infrastructure (e.g., stoplights). These intersections are more commonplace in rural areas, where traffic infrastructure is less developed. The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) aims to address such safety concerns through a network of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) that intercommunicate. This paper proposes a Road-Side Unit-based Virtual Intersection Management (RSU-VIM) over 802.11p system consisting of a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) lightweight RSU that is solar power-based and tailored to rural areas. The RSU utilizes the proposed RSU-VIM algorithm adapted from existing virtual traffic light methodologies to communicate with vehicles over IEEE 802.11p and facilitate intersection traffic, minimizing visibility issues. The implementation of the proposed system has a simulated cloud delay of 0.0841 s and an overall system delay of 0.4067 s with 98.611% reliability.

AB This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based framework for mandatory lane changing of automated vehicles in a non-cooperative environment. The objective is to create a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that is able to perform lane-changing maneuvers successfully and efficiently and with minimal impact on traffic flow in the target lane. For this purpose, this study utilizes the double deep Q-learning algorithm structure, which takes relevant traffic states as input and outputs the optimal actions (policy) for the automated vehicle. We put forward a realistic approach for dealing with this problem where, for instance, actions selected by the automated vehicle include steering angles and acceleration/deceleration values. We show that the RL agent is able to learn optimal policies for the different scenarios it encounters and performs the lane-changing task safely and efficiently. This work illustrates the potential of RL as a flexible framework for developing superior and more comprehensive lane-changing models that take into consideration multiple aspects of the road environment and seek to improve traffic flow as a whole.

AB In this paper, two generic line-of-sight (LOS) sensing-based short-range guidance methodologies are presented for the docking of autonomous vehicles. The first method utilizes a passive LOS sensing scheme to provide vehicle corrective motions, while the latter method utilizes active sensing. The novelty of the proposed guidance methodologies is their applicability to situations that do not allow for direct proximity measurements of the vehicle. In such instances, one must employ a guidance-based technique to move the vehicle to its desired pose using corrective actions at the final stages of its motion. The objective of both proposed guidance methods is, thus, to successfully minimize the systematic errors of the vehicle, while allowing it to converge to its desired pose within random noise limits. Both techniques were successfully tested via simulations and are discussed herein in terms of convergence rate and accuracy. in addition to the types of localization problems that each method should be used in.

AB The thermocline, which is common in the ocean, has an important influence on marine fisheries, underwater communication, and submarine activities. This study proposes a method for detecting and tracking a thermocline using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), which follows theSense -> Plan -> Actcontrol methodology. The adaptive control of the vehicle ensures that the AUV can cover the target thermocline as it evolves over time and space. Additionally, this method achieves coverage observation of a highly dynamic water column containing multiple thermoclines through the online evaluation of the vertical thermocline distribution. Computer simulations are conducted to illustrate the advantages of this algorithm. In the field tests, an AUV is deployed in the South China Sea under the guidance of the satellite remote sensing data. And the algorithm is run in real time to track the thermoclines with different structures in various environments. At the same time, a series of ship-based conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) stations are built along the predetermined trajectory of the AUV as the cross-validation of this method. The simulation and field test results demonstrate that the method is effective, practical, and can better perceive variations of a thermocline.

ID EXPERT JUDGMENT; PROBABILITY
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are used increasingly to explore hazardous marine environments. Risk assessment for such complex systems is based on subjective judgment and expert knowledge as much as on hard statistics. Here, we describe the use of a risk management process tailored to AUV operations, the implementation of which requires the elicitation of expert judgment. We conducted a formal judgment elicitation process where eight world experts in AUV design and operation were asked to assign a probability of AUV loss given the emergence of each fault or incident from the vehicle's life history of 63 faults and incidents. After discussing methods of aggregation and analysis, we show how the aggregated risk estimates obtained from the expert judgments were used to create a risk model. To estimate AUV survival with mission distance, we adopted a statistical survival function based on the nonparametric Kaplan-Meier estimator. We present theoretical formulations for the estimator, its variance, and confidence limits. We also present a numerical example where the approach is applied to estimate the probability that the Autosub3 AUV would survive a set of missions under Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica in January-March 2009.

AB This paper proposes a fuzzy logic based autonomous navigation controller for UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles). Three fuzzy logic modules are developed under the main navigation system for the control of the altitude, the speed, and the heading, through which the global position (latitude-longitude) of the air vehicle is controlled. A SID (Standard Instrument Departure) and TACAN (Tactical Air Navigation) approach is used and the performance of the fuzzy based controllers is evaluated with time based diagrams under MATLAB's standard configuration and the Aerosim Aeronautical Simulation Block Set which provides a complete set of tools for rapid development of detailed six-degree-of-freedom nonlinear generic manned/unmanned aerial vehicle models. The Aerosonde UAV model is used in the simulations in order to demonstrate the performance and the potential of the controllers. Additionally, FlightGear Flight Simulator and GMS aircraft instruments are deployed in order to get visual outputs that aid the designer in the evaluation of the controllers. Despite the simple design procedure, the simulated test flights indicate the capability of the approach in achieving the desired performance.

AB This paper investigates the problem of leader-follower formation control of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), where the Line-of-sight (LOS) range and angle are constrained. An observer is involved to estimate the leader velocity in finite time with zero error, alleviating the need of communications between the AUVs. Based on the finite time observer, the formation controllers of the AUVs are designed using time-varying In-type barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) method, which can guarantee that the resulting AUVs formation control system is uniformly ultimately bounded. To deal with the problem of explosion of differentiation terms in backstepping control, we introduce a command filter to realize the derivative of virtual variables. At the same time, a compensating signal is constructed (based on the auxiliary system technique) to compensate for the errors of the command filter. Simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigates the containment control problem of networked autonomous underwater vehicles in the presence of model uncertainty and unknown ocean disturbances. A predictor-based neural dynamic surface control design method is presented to develop the distributed adaptive containment controllers, under which the trajectories of follower vehicles nearly converge to the dynamic convex hull spanned by multiple reference trajectories over a directed network. Prediction errors, rather than tracking errors, are used to update the neural adaptation laws, which are independent of the tracking error dynamics, resulting in two time-scales to govern the entire system. The stability property of the closed-loop network is established via Lyapunov analysis, and transient property is quantified in terms of La norms of the derivatives of neural weights, which are shown to be smaller than the classical neural dynamic surface control approach. Comparative studies are given to show the substantial improvements of the proposed new method. (C) 2015 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Providing persistent intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance of targets is a challenging, but important task when time-critical information is required. In this letter, we provide a decentralized routing algorithm for coordinating multiple autonomous vehicles as they visit a discrete set of pre-defined targets with weighted revisit priorities. The algorithm utilizes a block coordinate ascent algorithm combined with a Monte Carlo tree search to tractably decide each vehicle's route. The result is a non-myopic algorithm for multiple vehicles that is decentralized, computationally tractable, and allows for target prioritization. Guarantees are provided that all targets will have finite revisit times and that the block coordinate ascent algorithm will converge to a block optimal solution. Numerical simulations illustrate the utility of this method by showing that the results are comparable to those of a centralized exhaustive search and that they degrade gracefully with limited communication and scale under increasing numbers of targets and vehicles.

AB This paper studies the path-following problems in autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) through predictive control and neural network modeling. Considering the model of AGVs is usually difficult to construct by first principles accurately, a data-driven approach based on deep neural networks is proposed to deal with the system identification tasks. Although deep neural networks have good representation capability for complex system, they are still hard to use for control area due to their nonconvexities and nonlinearities. Therefore, to make a trade-off between control tractability and model accuracy, the input convex neural networks (ICNNs) are developed to describe the dynamics of AGVs. As the designed neural networks are convex with regard to the inputs, the predictive control problem is converted to a convex optimization problem and thus it's easier to get feasible solutions. Besides, for adapting to different road conditions and some other disturbances, a periodically online learning algorithm is designed to update the neural network. Finally, two driving simulations under CarSim-Simulink platform are conducted to prove the superiority of our proposed techniques.

AB A fuzzy obstacle avoidance controller is designed for an autonomous vehicle. The controller is given the capability for obstacle avoidance by using negative fuzzy rules in conjunction with traditional positive ones. Negative fuzzy rules prescribe actions to be avoided rather than performed. A rule base of positive rules is specified by an expert for directing the vehicle to the target in the absence of obstacles, while a rule base of negative rules is experimentally determined from expert operation of the vehicle in the presence of obstacles. The consequents of the negative-rule system are codified into a chromosome, and this chromosome is evolved using an evolutionary algorithm. The resulting fuzzy system has far fewer rules than would be necessary for an obstacle avoidance controller using purely positive rules, while in addition retaining greater interpretability.

ID HEAVY-DUTY VEHICLES; DESIGN
AB One of the most critical obstacles in the automated operation of commercial heavy vehicles (CHVs) is the presence of significant delays in the fuel and brake actuators. These delays are especially important in longitudinal control of vehicle platoons that do not employ intervehicle communication, because their effect becomes cumulative as it propagates upstream, resulting in considerably degraded performance. Our objective in this paper is to design autonomous controllers which, in the presence of large delays, recover the good performance achieved when the delays are negligible. We propose two different approaches which are tailored to different performance requirements and computational resources. A backstepping-based nonlinear scheme with prediction almost recovers the original "delay-free" performance at the cost of additional controller complexity, while a simpler PED-based nonlinear scheme yields nearly as good performance.

AB A novel line-of-sight sensing-based modelless guidance strategy is presented for the autonomous docking of robotic vehicles. The novelty of the proposed guidance strategy is twofold: 1) applicability to situations that do not allow for direct proximity measurement of the vehicle and 2) ability to generate short-range docking motion commands without a need for a global sensingsystem (calibration) model. Two guidance-based motion-planning methods were developed to provide the vehicle controller with online corrective motion commands: a passive-sensing-based and an active-sensing-based scheme, respectively. The objective of-both proposed guidance methods is to minimize the accumulated systematic errors of the vehicle as a result of the long-range travel, while allowing it to converge to its desired pose within randomnoise limits. Both techniques were successfully tested via simulations and experiments, and are discussed herein, in terms of convergence rate and accuracy, in addition to the types of localization problems for which each method could be specifically more suitable.

AB With a goal to improve transportation safety, this paper proposes a collaborative driving framework based on assessments of both internal and external risks involved in vehicle driving. The internal risk analysis includes driver drowsiness detection and driver intention recognition that helps to understand the human driver's behavior. Steering wheel data and facial expression are used to detect the driver's drowsiness. Hidden Markov models are adapted to recognize the driver's intention using the vehicle's lane position, control, and state data. For the external risk analysis, a co-pilot utilizes a collision avoidance system to estimate the collision probability between the ego vehicle and other nearby vehicles. Based on the risk analyses, we design a novel collaborative driving scheme by fusing the control inputs from the human driver and the co-pilot to obtain the final control input for the ego vehicle under different circumstances. The proposed collaborative driving framework is validated in an assisted-driving testbed, which enables both autonomous and manual driving capabilities.

ID INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
AB In the context of autonomous driving, the iterative linear quadratic regulator (iLQR) is known to be an efficient approach to deal with the nonlinear vehicle model in motion planning problems. Particularly, the constrained iLQR algorithm has shown noteworthy advantageous outcomes of computation efficiency in achieving motion planning tasks under general constraints of different types. However, the constrained iLQR methodology requires a feasible trajectory at the first iteration as a prerequisite when the logarithmic barrier function is used. Also, the methodology leaves open the possibility for incorporation of fast, efficient, and effective optimization methods to further speed up the optimization process such that the requirements of real-time implementation can be successfully fulfilled. In this paper, a well-defined motion planning problem is formulated under nonlinear vehicle dynamics and various constraints, and an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is utilized to determine the optimal control actions leveraging the iLQR. The approach is able to circumvent the feasibility requirement of the trajectory at the first iteration. An illustrative example of motion planning for autonomous vehicles is then investigated. A noteworthy achievement of high computation efficiency is attained with the proposed development; comparing with the constrained iLQR algorithm based on the logarithmic barrier function, our proposed method reduces the average computation time by 31.93%, 38.52%, and 44.57% in the three driving scenarios; compared with the optimization solver IPOPT, our proposed method reduces the average computation time by 46.02%, 53.26%, and 88.43% in the three driving scenarios. As a result, real-time computation and implementation can be realized through our proposed framework, and thus it provides additional safety to the on-road driving tasks.

AB This paper investigates the problem of finite-time trajectory tracking for fully actuated autonomous surface vehicles without the velocity measurements, in the presence of uncertain parameters and complex environmental disturbances. Firstly, a generalized nonlinear finite-time extended state observer is proposed to recover the velocities and synthetic disturbances simultaneously. The generalized structure can further enhance the estimation accuracy and the observation errors are proved to be finite-time uniformly ultimately bounded stable. Then, a two-loop control law is developed by using virtual velocity command and fast non-singular integral terminal sliding controller. The observer is integrated with the controller to overcome the problem of unavailable surge, sway, yaw velocities and to rapidly reject disturbances, thereby contributing to fast and accurate trajectory tracking of the vehicle. Theoretical analysis for finite-time stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously derived through the Lyapunov's stability theory. Finally, comparative simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control approach.

AB In dial-a-ride systems involving autonomous vehicles circulating along a circuit, a fleet of vehicles must serve clients who request rides between stations of the circuit such that the total number of pick-up and drop-off operations is minimized. In this paper, we focus on a unitary variant where each client requests a single place in the vehicles and all the clients must be served within a single tour of the circuit. Such unitary variant induces a combinatorial optimization problem for which we introduce a nontrivial special case that is polynomially solvable when the capacity of each vehicle is at most 2 but it is NP-Hard otherwise. We also study the polytope associated with the solutions to this problem. We introduce new families of valid inequalities and give necessary and sufficient conditions under which they are facet -defining. Based on these inequalities, we devise an efficient branch-and-cut algorithm that outperforms the state-of-the-art commercial solvers.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Autonomous driving; Deep learning; Computer vision
AB Modern autonomous driving techniques harness a variety of visual cues for performing key tasks like vehicle steering and collision avoidance. This work defines for the first time and proposes a solution to the following problem: can one precisely estimate an autonomous vehicle's orientation relative to the road by taking a picture from within the vehicle? Vehicle orientation supplies crucial information for making various driving-related decisions. The key challenge of this problem is the lack of training data, since accurately annotating vehicle's orientation information in an image is in general difficult. To circumvent the data scarcity issue, we propose to leverage publicly-available street panoramas as those found in GoogleMaps. Street panoramas are essentially defined by 2-D plenoptic functions that map the visual environment to a sphere. One can thus effortlessly collect annotated data for the interested task by specifying a direction and reading out corresponding pixels from a panorama. This way we collect a city-scale large benchmark TB500K for studying this problem. Our second contribution is the exposition of a two-stream deep network for attacking this problem. Intuitively, visual/semantic and geometric (e.g., the direction of road lanes) cues are both crucial and complement each other. Our proposed two-stream network can jointly learn from both cues and serves as a reasonable baseline for this novel problem. In addition, several experiments are also conducted to reveal key factors in estimating the vehicle orientation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Underwater dynamic target tracking technology has a wide application prospect in marine resource exploration, underwater engineering operations, naval battlefield monitoring, and underwater precision guidance. Aiming at the underwater dynamic target tracking problem, an autonomous underwater vehicle tracking control method based on trajectory prediction is studied. First, a deep learning-based target detection algorithm is developed. For the image collected by the multibeam forward-looking sonar image, this algorithm uses the YOLO v3 network to determine the target in a sonar image and obtain the position of the target. Then, a time profit Elman neural network (TPENN) is constructed to predict the trajectory information of the dynamic target. Compared with an ordinary Elman neural network, its accuracy of dynamic target prediction is increased. Finally, underwater tracking of the dynamic target is realized using the model predictive controller (MPC), and the tracking result is stable and reliable. Through simulations and experiment, the proposed underwater dynamic target tracking control method is demonstrated to be effective and feasible.

AB A fully autonomous flight vehicle must be capable of accurately tracking a desired trajectory far the safe and effective completion of a given mission. An approach to maneuver autopilot design is presented based on a six-degree-of-freedom nonlinear trimming algorithm coupled with a robust tracking controller Acceleration commands required for closed-loop tracking of a desired trajectory in an Earth-fixed reference frame are provided by a simple guidance strategy. The trimming algorithm generates optimal state commands and feedforward controls to accomplish the maneuver, while assuring that these commands fan be tracked by an inner-loop controller without violating vehicle performance or actuator constraints. This approach is demonstrated in simulated flight of an actual fixed-wing uninhabited aerial vehicle, named Ariel. Excellent tracking performance is achieved for a representative three-dimensional trajectory using a high-fidelity aircraft model with nonlinear dynamics and realistic wind gust disturbances. In addition, an analysis of system robustness to uncertainty in the vehicle model is performed.

AB The pervasiveness of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), from insect to airplane scales, combined with active flow control maturity, has set the scene for vehicles that differ markedly from present-day configurations. Nano and micro air vehicles, with characteristic Reynolds numbers typically less than 105, rely on periodically generated leading-edge vortices for lift generation, propulsion, and maneuvering. This is most commonly achieved by mechanical flapping or pulsed plasma actuation. On larger UAVs, with Reynolds numbers greater than 105, externally driven and autonomous fluidic systems continue to dominate. These include traditional circulation control techniques, autonomous synthetic jets, and discrete sweeping jets. Plasma actuators have also shown increased technological maturity. Energy efficiency is a major challenge, whether it be batteries and power electronics on nano and micro air vehicles or acceptably low compressor bleed on larger UAVs. Further challenges involve the development of aerodynamic models based on experiments or numerical simulations, as well as flight dynamics models.

AB A novel adaptive coordinated platoon control of connected autonomous distributed electric vehicles (CADEVs) on curved roads is proposed to increase traffic security. The nonlinear vehicle dynamic model that can precisely reflect the driving behaviours of CADEVs on curved roads is deduced by the Newton-Euler method. Owing to the fact that CADEVs have the strong coupled, uncertain non-linear and over-actuated features, a novel disturbance observer-based adaptive coordinated optimal dynamic platoon control strategy is presented to supervise the lateral and longitudinal coupled motions of CADEVs on curved roads, in which the switching gains of backstepping sliding mode control term are precisely adjusted by the neural-network technique, and the uniform ultimate boundedness of closed-loop high-level control system is guaranteed through the Lyapunov stability theory. Then, a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) tire distributor is the basic component of the low-level control law, which can realise the dynamic control distribution of over-actuated tire actuators of CADEVs. Finally, the results manifest the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive coordinated platoon control strategy.

AB In this paper, a Neural-Network- (NN) based guidance methodology is proposed for the high-precision docking of autonomous vehicles/platforms. The novelty of the overall online motion-planning methodology is its applicability to cases that do not allow for the direct proximity measurement of the vehicle's pose (position and orientation). In such instances, a guidance technique that utilizes Line-of-Sight(LOS) based task-space sensory feedback is needed to minimize the detrimental impact of accumulated systematic motion errors. Herein, the proposed NN-based guidance methodology is implemented during the final stage of the vehicle's motion (i.e., docking). Systematic motion errors, which are accumulated after a long-range motion are reduced iteratively by executing corrective motion commands generated by the NN until the vehicle achieves its desired pose within random noise limits. The proposed guidance methodology was successfully tested via simulations for a 6-dof (degree-of-freedom) vehicle and via experiments for a 3-dof high-precision planar platform.

AB The industrial development of the last few decades has prompted an increase in the number of vehicles by multiple folds. With the increased number of vehicles on the road, safety has become one of the primary concerns. Inter vehicular communication, specially Vehicle to Everything (V2X) communication can address these pressing issues including autonomous traffic systems and autonomous driving. The reliability and effectiveness of V2X communication greatly depends on communication architecture and the associated wireless technology. Addressing this challenge, a device-to-device (D2D)-based reliable, robust, and energy-efficient V2X communication architecture is proposed with LoRa wireless technology. The proposed system takes a D2D communication approach to reduce the latency by offering direct vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, rather than routing the data via the LoRa WAN server. Additionally, the proposed architecture offers modularity and compact design, making it ideal for legacy systems without requiring any additional hardware. Testing and analysis suggest the proposed system can communicate reliably with roadside infrastructures and other vehicles at speeds ranging from 15-50 km per hour (kmph). The data packet consists of 12 bytes of metadata and 28 bytes of payload. At 15 kmph, a vehicle sends one data packet every 25.9 m, and at 50 kmph, it sends the same data packet every 53.34 m with reliable transitions.

AB When the linear Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm is used for trajectory tracking control of autonomous vehicles in high-speed turning conditions, the tracking accuracy is usually decreased due to the low fidelity of the predictive model. To deal with this problem, a trajectory tracking controller based on Neural Network Predictive Control (NNPC) is designed in this paper. The data collected from driving simulation experiments is used for the Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) training process to obtain the vehicle state predictive models. To reduce the iteration times of the rolling optimization module of NNPC, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with Fitness Allocating Inertia Weights (PSO-FAIW) algorithm is proposed, which can allocate inertia weights in light of the distance between each particle's fitness and the best fitness of the swarm. Finally, the performance of the controller designed in this paper is verified based on MATLAB /Simulink. The simulation results demonstrate that the controller proposed in this paper can give consideration to tracking accuracy and real-time performance.

AB This research proposes a unified guidance and control framework for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) based on the task priority control approach, incorporating various behaviors such as path following, terrain following, obstacle avoidance, as well as homing and docking to stationary and moving stations. The integration of homing and docking maneuvers into the task priority framework is thus a novel contribution of this paper. This integration allows, for example, to execute homing maneuvers close to uneven seafloor or obstacles, ensuring the safety of the AUV, as safety tasks can be given the highest priority. Furthermore, another contribution shown in the paper is that the proposed approach tackles a wide range of scenarios without ad hoc solutions. Indeed, the proposed approach is well suited for both the emerging trend of resident AUVs, which stay underwater for a long period inside garage stations, exiting to perform inspection and maintenance missions and homing back to them, and for AUVs that are required to dock to moving stations such as surface vehicles, or towed docking stations. The proposed techniques are studied in a simulation setting, taking into account the rich number of aforementioned scenarios.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) generally work in complex marine environments. Any fault in AUVs may cause significant losses. Thus, system reliability and automatic fault diagnosis are important. To address the actuator failure of AUVs, a fault diagnosis method based on the Gaussian particle filter is proposed in this study. Six free-space motion equation mathematical models are established in accordance with the actuator configuration of AUVs. The value of the control (moment) loss parameter is adopted on the basis of these models to represent underwater vehicle malfunction, and an actuator failure model is established. An improved Gaussian particle filtering algorithm is proposed and is used to estimate the AUV failure model and motion state. Bayes algorithm is employed to perform robot fault detection. The sliding window method is adopted for fault magnitude estimation. The feasibility and validity of the proposed method are verified through simulation experiments and experimental data.

AB Traditional traffic control systems based on traffic light have achieved a great success in reducing the average delay of vehicles or in improving the traffic capacity. The main idea of these systems is based on the optimization of the cycle time, the phase sequence, and the phase duration. The right-of-ways are assigned to vehicles of one or several movements for a specific time. With the emergence of cooperative driving, an innovative traffic control concept, Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM), has emerged. In the framework of AIM, the right-of-way is customized on the measurement of the vehicle state and the traffic control turns to determine the passing sequence of vehicles. Since each vehicle is considered individually, AIM faces a combinatorial optimization problem. This paper proposes a dynamic programming algorithm to find its optimal solution in polynomial time. Experimental results obtained by simulation show that the proper arrangement of the vehicle passing sequence can greatly improve traffic efficiency at intersections.

ID CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL
AB With rapidly developing autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies, the optimal driving strategy should consider multi-objective optimization problems of large-scale transportation systems, including safety and efficiency. Different driving strategies have different performance, and there is an interaction between vehicles with different strategies. Since the Nash equilibrium is hard to find for an n-player game, it is difficult to get an analytical solution to this multi-objective optimization problem. Therefor a coevolutionary algorithm is proposed to explore the interactions between populations with different strategies and investigate the cooperation and competition among vehicles. Combining the multi-objective optimization algorithm and the incentive mechanism of survival of the fittest reproduction law, the system structure reaches a stable equilibrium state and the optimal group driving strategy evolves. Simulation results, with 40,000 vehicles driving in Luxembourg SUMO Traffic Scenario, demonstrate that the rational-rational strategy performs best among six typical strategies. Meanwhile, the accident rate drops by 56%, while the overall average speed increases by 30%. The results of multi-vehicle and multi-objective coevolution are enlightening in designing optimal driving strategy with AVs.

AB Underwater gliders use a buoyancy engine and symmetric wings to produce lift. During operation, gliders follow a saw-tooth trajectory, making them useful vehicles for profiling ocean chemistry. By operating at low speeds with low hotel loads, gliders achieve a high endurance. Man-portable, propeller-driven autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are capable of level flight and can also follow terrain to yield high-quality benthic imagery. These platforms typically operate at high speeds with high hotel loads resulting in relatively low endurance. Although both vehicles are used to collect oceanographic data, constraints on how these vehicles are used differentiate the nature of data they collect. This article examines whether one method of propulsion can provide an intrinsic advantage in terms of horizontal range at low speed, regardless of sampling design. We employ first-principle analysis that concludes that either class of vehicle can be designed to achieve the same horizontal transit performance regardless of speed. This result implies that the choice of propulsion method should be driven exclusively by the application and operational requirements.

AB We present a learning model predictive controller (LMPC) for autonomous racing. We model the autonomous racing problem as a minimum time iterative control task, where an iteration corresponds to a lap. The system trajectory and input sequence of each lap are stored and used to systematically update the controller for the next lap. In the proposed approach, the race time does not increase at each iteration. The first contribution is to propose a local LMPC which reduces the computational burden associated with existing LMPC strategies. In particular, we show how to construct a local safe set and approximation to the value function, using a subset of the stored data. The second contribution is to present a system identification strategy for the autonomous racing iterative control task. We use data from previous iterations and the vehicle's kinematic equations of motion to build an affine time-varying prediction model. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated by experimental results on the Berkeley Autonomous Race Car (BARC) platform.

AB 6G is the future of intelligent connectivity artefacts with Artificial Intelligence (AI) at its backbone. The Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) based 6G enabled infrastructure helps in achieving the required zero latency for autonomous Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) with features of low power consumption, lower end-to-end latency, minimal processing/transmission overheads, higher throughput and reliability. MEC are prone to a deadlock due to the limited amount of available computational resources, resulting in fatal delays in Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicles to Road Side Unit (RSU) and RSU to ITS communication. The unresolved deadlock may entail higher energy consumption that can adversely affect the Quality of Service (QoS) in terms of safety and reliability with potential threats of causing fatal accidents. Therefore, it is almost imperative to resolve the deadlocks from MEC to comply with the QoS parameters of MEC based autonomous vehicles. The asserted goals can be achieved by employing an intelligent and adaptive deadlock resolution strategy. In this paper, a deadlock-aware, and collaborative edge decision algorithm has been proposed for facilitating the seamless communication of autonomous vehicles over MEC. Additionally, deadlock avoidance and prevention schemes have been evaluated using Bankers resource request avoidance algorithm, wound wait algorithm and wait-die algorithms for resource provisioning in collaborative MEC. Furthermore, the effectiveness of deadlock avoidance and prevention algorithms in real-time scenarios has been analyzed in MEC systems. The metrics used for a comparative analysis in this research include Round-trip time, Queue wait-time and CPU utilization. The proposed algorithm shows promising results when compared with prevalent techniques.

AB The ongoing digitalization of the economy is challenging the value creation process in traditional business. In the mobility-related industry, the disruptive potential of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) has the ca-pacity to transform business models. However, great uncertainty exists regarding the technological evolution and social trends that will condition businesses in the near future. This paper intends to use contingency theory to shed light on this topic and better understand the enhancers and barriers that managers should deal with to create, deliver, and capture value associated to CAV. With this aim, the paper adopts a qualitative approach based on in-depth interviews with high-level managers from different industries. The findings suggest the importance of data management to better understand the needs of the customer and vehicle requirements so that differential value can be provided. Two potential solutions that have emerged are, first, the establishment of alliances between companies competing in different areas and, second, digital platforms in order to enhance customer experience and the evolution from B2C to B2B markets associated with growing servitization.

AB Monitoring offshore infrastructure is a challenging task owing to the harsh ocean environment. To reduce human involvement in this task, this study proposes an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV)-based structural monitoring system for inspecting power cable lines under the ocean surface. The proposed ASV was equipped with multimodal sonar sensors, including a multibeam echosounder (MBES) and side-scan sonar (SSS) for mapping the seafloor, combined with a precisely estimated vehicle pose from navigation sensors. In particular, a globally consistent map was developed using the orthometric height as a vertical datum estimated based on the geoid height received from the GPS. Accordingly, the MBES and SSS generate a map of the target objects in the form of point clouds and sonar images, respectively. Dedicated outlier removal methods for MBES sensing were proposed to preserve the sparse inlier point cloud, and we applied the projection of the SSS image pixels to reflect the geometry of the seafloor. A field test was conducted in an ocean environment using real offshore cable lines to verify the efficiency of the proposed monitoring system.

AB The use of advanced driver assistance systems and the transition towards semi-autonomous vehicles are expected to contribute to a lower frequency of motor accidents and to have a significant impact for the automobile insurance industry, as rating methods must be revised to ensure that risks are correctly measured. Telematics information and usage-based insurance research are analyzed to identify the effect of driving patterns on the risk of accident. This is used as a starting point for addressing risk quantification and safety for vehicles that can control speed. The effect of excess speed on the risk of accidents is estimated with a real telematics data set. Scenarios for a reduction of speed limit violations and the consequent decrease in the expected number of accident claims are shown. If excess speed could be eliminated, then the expected number of accident claims could be reduced to half of its initial value, applying the average conditions of the data used in this study. As a consequence, insurance premiums also diminish.

AB Considering the effectiveness of maritime transportation, a large number of world's trade is carried by sea and ports. Monitoring ports and harbors are essential for 24 hourly loading/unloading of ships. In this regard, bathymetry and monitoring of depth data especially in real time manner would be very valuable and worthy. To plot hydrography map of ports and harbors in the bureau as online and with low cost, a Surface Vehicle (SV) is designed and developed. This vehicle could navigate in four modes. Operator could seat on the boat and run by joystick or stand in slipway and control by Remote Controller (RC) or seat in the office and navigate by a user friend graphical interface. Finally the boat could navigate fully autonomous without any supervision. Comparison accuracy and precision of four mentioned navigation modes was the main objective of this research. Experimental results illustrated that autonomous mode with Standard Deviation (SD) of below 0.5 m was the most precision and comfortable mode, while RC is the more reliable and trustworthy.

AB In this paper, a path planning approach is developed and demonstrated for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); the algorithm is applicable for autonomous robot path planning also. The main contribution of the paper is the development of an extension to the Bellman-Ford algorithm that enables incorporation of constraints directly into the algorithm during run-time. This, therefore, provides a framework for path planning, which does not cause violation of the dynamical constraints of the vehicle (or robot), such as its angle of turn. Furthermore, a procedure for computing a number of sub-optimal paths is developed so that a range of options is available for selection; the optimality of the paths is also proved. These sub-optimal paths are generated in an order of priority (optimality). An objective function is developed that models different conflicting objectives in a unified framework; these objectives can be assigned different weights. The objectives may include minimizing the length of the path, keeping the path as straight as possible, visiting areas of interest, avoiding obstacles, approaching the terminal point from a given direction, etc. The algorithm is tested for complex mission objectives, and results are discussed.

AB Beyond the individual independent unmanned autonomous vehicle (UAV), cooperative control of multiple UAVs has started to receive significant attention from industry, academia and the military. For the sake of UAV cooperation, proper wireless communication is imperative, but incurs several problems. Among them, spatially secure group communication (SSGC), which must maximize spatial UAV group size while minimizing the communication boundary of the group, is a unique problem for multiple UAV control from a security perspective. In particular, the SSGC problem must be considered for military applications such as multiple unmanned aerial or ground vehicle control. In this paper, we investigate the SSGC problem. To provide a solution, an analytical framework is first presented to model the dynamics of multiple UAVs and SSGC. The theoretical analysis and simulation results regarding how communication affects group dynamics and spatial communication security are also discussed. Our contribution is to suggest a new way to view multiple UAV control with spatially secure communication, and to provide a distributed method to address the problem cooperatively.

ID VOLUME
AB An autonomous underwater hovering vehicle (AUH) is a novel, dish-shaped, axisymmetric, multi-functional, ultra-mobile submersible in the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) family. Numerical studies of nonlinear, asymmetric water entry impact forces on symmetrical, airborne-launched AUVs from conventional single-arm cranes on a research vessel, or helicopters or planes, is significant for the fast and safe launching of low-speed AUVs into the target sea area in the overall design. Moreover, a single-arm crane is one of the important ways to launch AUVs with high expertise and security. However, AUVs are still subject to a huge load upon impact during water entry, causing damage to the body, malfunction of electronic components, and other serious accidents. This paper analyses the water entry impact forces of an airborne-launched AUH as a feasibility study for flight- or helicopter-launched AUHs in the future. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis software STAR-CCM+ solver was adopted to simulate AUH motions with different water entry speeds and immersion angles using overlapping grid technology and user-defined functions (UDFs). In the computational domain for a steady, incompressible, two-dimensional flow of water with identified boundary conditions, two components (two-phase flow) were modeled in the flow field: Liquid water and free surface air. The variations of stress and velocity versus time of the AUH and fluid structure deformation in the whole water entry process were obtained, which provides a reference for future structural designs of an AUH and appropriate working conditions for an airborne-launched AUH. This research will be conducive to smoothly carrying out the complex tasks of AUHs on the seabed.

AB LiDAR sensors are almost indispensable for autonomous robots to perceive the surrounding environment. However, the transmission of large-scale LiDAR point clouds is highly bandwidth-intensive, which can easily lead to transmission problems, especially for unstable communication networks. Meanwhile, existing LiDAR data compression is mainly based on rate-distortion optimization, which ignores the semantic information of ordered point clouds and the task requirements of autonomous robots. To address these challenges, this article presents a task-driven Scene-Aware LiDAR Point Clouds Coding (SA-LPCC) framework for autonomous vehicles. Specifically, a semantic segmentation model is developed based on multidimension information, in which both 2-D texture and 3-D topology information are fully utilized to segment movable objects. Furthermore, a prediction-based deep network is explored to remove the spatial-temporal redundancy. The experimental results on the benchmark semantic KITTI dataset validate that our SA-LPCC achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of the reconstruction quality and storage space for downstream tasks. We believe that SA-LPCC jointly considers the scene-aware characteristics of movable objects and removes the spatial-temporal redundancy from an end-to-end learning mechanism, which will boost the related applications from algorithm optimization to industrial products.

AB Microscopic car-following models can be applied in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) to control the real-time longitudinal interactions among individual vehicles. Moreover, they can have a vital role in Advanced Vehicle Control and Safety Systems (AVCSSs) such as collision warning, adaptive cruise control, lane guidance driver assistance, brake assist as well as in modeling simulation of safety studies and capacity analysis in transportation science. In reality, sensor measurements are generally inaccurate. Surprisingly no comparative assessment of the car-following models in presence of sensor (measurement) errors for AVs exist till now to the best of our knowledge. Therefore, in this paper we evaluate the prominent car-following models for Avs in presence of sensor errors in terms of safety, trip times, flow and fuel efficiency through simulations. We show that sensor errors significantly impact safety and flow in all models, while they do increase trip times and fuel consumption of some of the models. None of the models is completely fault-tolerant and suitable for AVs as some models produce collisions and/or negative velocity while all models violate traffic light. Nonetheless, the k-leader Fuel-efficient Traffic Model (kFTM) is the most fault-tolerant negative velocity and collision free model having reasonable trip times and energy consumption among the investigated models.

DE Trajectory prediction; CTRA; HMM; GMM; fusion prediction model
AB At present, accurately predicting the long-term trajectory of traffic vehicles for autonomous vehicles remains a challenging task. Dynamic scenarios often necessitate frequent replanning, which can waste computing resources and increase the risk of traffic accidents. To address this issue, this paper proposes a vehicle trajectory fusion prediction method based on a physical model and driving intention recognition. Firstly, trajectory prediction is based on the Constant Turn Rate and Acceleration (CTRA) model, which is combined with the vehicle's motion state to obtain Trajectory1. Next, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is employed to identify driving intentions. Building upon this, a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is used to perform probability density statistical analysis on driving data, yielding feature parameters Dx and Dy. These parameters are then combined with a Quintic polynomial to predict the trajectory, resulting in Trajectory2. Finally, Trajectory1 and Trajectory2 are fused to obtain the ultimate predicted trajectory, referred to as Trajectory3. To validate the effectiveness of the trajectory prediction method proposed in this paper, the algorithm is tested in both left lane change (LCL) and right lane change (LCR) scenarios. The test results demonstrate that the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and maximum absolute error (MXAE) for Trajectory3, generated using the fusion algorithm, are significantly smaller than those for Trajectory1 and Trajectory2. This indicates the efficacy of the proposed model, which contributes to making high-quality decisions and plans for autonomous vehicles, reducing the probability of traffic accidents, and enhancing public confidence in autonomous vehicle technology.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) represent an emerging and disruptive technology that provides a great opportunity for future transport not only to have a positive social and environmental impact but also traffic safety. AV use in daily life has been extensively studied in the literature in various dimensions, however; it is time for AVs to go further which is another technological aspect of communication. Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) technology is an emerging issue that is expected to be a mutual part of AVs and transportation safety in the near future. V2V is widely discussed by its deployment possibilities not only by means of communication, even to be used as an energy transfer medium. ZalaZONE Proving Ground is a 265-hectare high-tech test track for conventional, electric as well as connected, assisted, and automated vehicles. This paper investigates the use of drones for tracking the cars on the test track. The drones are planned to work as an uplink for the data collected by the onboard sensors of the car. The car is expected to communicate with the drone which is flying in coordination. For the communication 868 MHz is selected to be used between the car and the drone. The test is performed to simulate different flight altitudes of drones. The signal strength of the communication is analyzed, and a model is developed which can be used for the future planning of the test track applications.

AB The design and initial testing of a wind- and solar-powered (WASP) autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) are presented. The concept vehicle is a 4.2-m length overall (L(OA)) monohull keel-boat powered by a rigid wing sail with a 5-m span. It is designed to operate in 7-10 kn of wind and a maximum sea state of 2. Specific attention is placed on the aerodynamic, hydrodynamic, and systems integration aspects of the design. Rigid wing sails are shown to have superior performance to conventional cloth sails for use on ASVs owing to their higher aerodynamic efficiency and robustness. The manual design process involved in selection of the airfoil cross section for the wing sail and the resulting aerodynamic performance predictions are presented. Through mathematical derivation, the optimal angle for switching the sail configuration from an upwind/crosswind lift-generating mode to a downwind drag-generating mode is found to be 135 degrees. To simplify implementation of the control system when operating in the lift-generating sailing mode, a control scheme that decouples heading and speed control by simply setting the wing sail to an angle of attack of 10 degrees and independently controlling heading was used. The simulation results from a velocity prediction program (VPP) used to verify the feasibility of this control approach are presented. Initial field trials of the vehicle using the control approach with autonomous wing control and manual rudder control are presented. It is shown that the measured boat speeds and wind speed/directions are within the range of values expected from the VPP. Temperatures recorded in a thermal plume during the field trials of the ASV are shown as a function of global positioning system (GPS) location and time.

DE underwater navigation; odometry; underwater vehicle
AB In order to autonomously transfer from one point of the environment to the other, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) need a navigational system. While navigating underwater the vehicles usually use a dead reckoning method which calculates vehicle movement on the basis of the information about velocity (sometimes also acceleration) and course (heading) provided by on-board devicesl ike Doppler Velocity Logs and Fibre Optical Gyroscopes. Due to inaccuracies of the devices and the influence of environmental forces, the position generated by the dead reckoning navigational system (DRNS) is not free from errors, moreover the errors grow exponentially in time. The problem becomes even more serious when we deal with small AUVs which do not have any speedometer on board and whose course measurement device is inaccurate. To improve indications of the DRNS the vehicle can emerge onto the surface from time to time, record its GPS position, and measure position error which can be further used to estimate environmental influence and inaccuracies caused by mechanisms of the vehicle. This paper reports simulation tests which were performed to determine the most effective method for correction of DRNS designed for a real Biomimetic AUV.

AB Changing lanes while driving requires coordinating the lateral and longitudinal controls of a vehicle, considering its running state and the surrounding environment. Although the existing rule-based automated lane-changing method is simple, it is unsuitable for unpredictable scenarios encountered in practice. Therefore, using a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, we propose an end-to-end method for automated lane changing based on lidar data. The distance state information of the lane boundary and the surrounding vehicles obtained by the agent in a simulation environment is denoted as the state space for an automated lane-change problem based on reinforcement learning. The steering wheel angle and longitudinal acceleration are used as the action space, and both the state and action spaces are continuous. In terms of the reward function, avoiding collision and setting different expected lane-changing distances that represent different driving styles are considered for security, and the angular velocity of the steering wheel and jerk are considered for comfort. The minimum speed limit for lane changing and the control of the agent for a quick lane change are considered for efficiency. For a one-way two-lane road, a visual simulation environment scene is constructed using Pyglet. By comparing the lane-changing process tracks of two driving styles in a simplified traffic flow scene, we study the influence of driving style on the lane-changing process and lane-changing time. Through the training and adjustment of the combined lateral and longitudinal control of autonomous vehicles with different driving styles in complex traffic scenes, the vehicles could complete a series of driving tasks while considering driving-style differences. The experimental results show that autonomous vehicles can reflect the differences in the driving styles at the time of lane change at the same speed. Under the combined lateral and longitudinal control, the autonomous vehicles exhibit good robustness to different speeds and traffic density in different road sections. Thus, autonomous vehicles trained using the proposed method can learn an automated lane-changing policy while considering safety, comfort, and efficiency.

AB The traditional Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) with constant weight values of the evaluation function leads to the inability of obstacle avoidance for the Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) to perform obstacle avoidance and path planning in the complex environment. Effective avoidance of complex obstacles requires adaptive weight adjustment to address the evaluation function's challenges. This paper proposes an adaptive DWA (ADWA), which introduces neural network training on the basis of the Mamdani DWA (MDWA). Firstly, the Mamdani type fuzzy controller is designed, and then the adaptive neuro-fuzzy controller is obtained by neural network training. Then, experiments are carried out through the MATLAB simulation environment. The simulation experiment results show that the improved DWA compared to traditional DWA can make the AGV pass the obstacle environment with a better trajectory and reduce the time. The improved DWA improves the autonomous obstacle avoidance capability of AGVs, which not only perfectly fits our task requirements, but also has apparent scientific and practical significance in developing AGV autonomous obstacle avoidance technology.

AB Lane detection is necessary for developing intelligent Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). Using vision-based lane detection is more cost-effective, requiring less operational power. Images captured by the moving vehicle include varying brightness, blur, and occlusion caused due to diverse locations. We propose a Vision-based Ingenious Lane Departure Warning System (VILDS) for AV to address these challenges. The Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) of the VILDS choose the most precise features to create images that are identical to the original but have better clarity. The system also uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to learn the average behavior of the samples to forecast lanes based on a live feed of processed images, which predicts incomplete lanes and increases the reliability of the AV's trajectory. Further, we devise a strategy to improve the Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS) by determining the angle and direction of deviation to predict the AV's Lane crossover. An extensive evaluation of the proposed VILDS system demonstrated the effective working of the lane detection and departure warning system modules with an accuracy of 98.2% and 96.5%, respectively.

TI Robust Path Planner for Autonomous Vehicles on Roads With Large

DT Article
DE Constrained motion planning; motion and path planning
AB Path planning in real road traffic refers to the navigation of an autonomous vehicle through an obstacle-filled environment. It is crucial for the comfort, safety, and efficiency of the autonomous driving experience. It is advantageous to plan paths in the reference line-based Frenet frames rather than the Cartesian frame to decouple the 2-dimensional vehicle motion into a lateral and a longitudinal component. Path planning has two important and implicit assumptions: 1) the curvature of the reference line has to be sufficiently small, and 2) the vehicle can not be too far from the reference line. Therefore, the generated paths should follow the reference line and always head in the correct direction. However, these assumptions do not always hold in real road traffic, and the generated paths may demonstrate some unintended behaviors. In this study, we discuss the necessary and sufficient requirements for the generated paths to follow the reference line and head in the correction direction, and then proposed an efficient solution for Frenet-based path planning when the assumptions are not satisfied. Experimental results on simulated driving scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

AB Autonomous-guided vehicles (AGVs) are becoming increasingly prevalent and already helping in a variety of activities, ranging from space exploration to domestic housework. Recent advances in the design of sensors, motors and microelectromechanical systems are bringing us closer to the realization of autonomous multi robot systems which perform complex tasks. In this work, we explored the problem of vehicle routing and motion planning for a fleet of AGVs in a flexible manufacturing system (FMS). Considering concurrently fuzzy demands associated with the workstations and fuzzy travel distances while moving between workstations, the problem is addressed in the context of uncertainty both in demands and travel times. The proposed motion planner is combined with a scheduler allowing each AGV to update its destination resource during navigation in order to complete the transported product. Furthermore, in order to take into account the fuzziness which may arise in the FMS, the proposed planner is integrated with fuzzy theory on fuzzy sets and fuzzy numbers. The efficiency of the solution procedure is demonstrated through numerical examples.

AB The development of a novel adaptive autopilot for the dive-plane control of multi-input multi-output submarines with unmodeled dynamics, based on the L-1 adaptive control theory, is the subject of this article. An L-1 adaptive autopilot is designed for the trajectory control of the depth and pitch angle using bow and stern hydroplanes. Interestingly, the structure of the adaptive controller remains fixed, regardless of the nonlinearities and external disturbance inputs, retained in the model of the submarine. Unlike the traditional adaptive control laws, the L-1 adaptive control input is generated by filtering the estimated control signal. A nice feature of the control law is that it is possible to achieve fast adaptation and desirable performance bounds in the closed-loop system by the choice of large adaptation gains. Simulation results are presented, which show that the autopilot accomplishes precise trajectory control in the dive plane, despite parametric uncertainties, unmodeled nonlinearities, and random disturbance inputs.

AB A longitudinal dynamic model of autonomous vehicle is presented. Based on the dynamics analysis, the engine model, hydraulic variator model, automatic transmission model, and vehicle quality model are built to get the transmission relationship from throttle opening degree to vehicle acceleration. The accuracy and the rationality of this dynamic model are verified by CarSim simulation experiments. Fuzzy PID control method is a common intelligent control algorithm. For typical Type-1 Fuzzy sets, fuzzy variable partition and fuzzy rules are a little less fine. In order to improve PID parameter regulation, decomposed fuzzy system (DFS) is introduced to design PID controller. Furthermore, a simplified decomposed fuzzy PID (SDFPID) controller is designed considering the computational complexity. Finally, this paper simulates the performance of PID, fuzzy PID, and SDFPID, respectively. The experiment results show that SDFPID improves the transient response in consideration of the resistance, the vehicle's own transmission efficiency, transmission ratio, engine inertia, and other parameters. The proposed method has good application.

AB Recent advancements in perception for autonomous driving are driven by deep learning. In order to achieve robust and accurate scene understanding, autonomous vehicles are usually equipped with different sensors (e.g. cameras, LiDARs, Radars), and multiple sensing modalities can be fused to exploit their complementary properties. In this context, many methods have been proposed for deep multi-modal perception problems. However, there is no general guideline for network architecture design, and questions of "what to fuse", "when to fuse", and "how to fuse" remain open. This review paper attempts to systematically summarize methodologies and discuss challenges for deep multi-modal object detection and semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. To this end, we first provide an overview of on-board sensors on test vehicles, open datasets, and background information for object detection and semantic segmentation in autonomous driving research. We then summarize the fusion methodologies and discuss challenges and open questions. In the appendix, we provide tables that summarize topics and methods. We also provide an interactive online platform to navigate each reference: https://boschresearch.github.io/multimodalperception/.

AB Connected vehicles, whether equipped with advanced driver-assistance systems or fully autonomous, require human driver supervision and are currently constrained to visual information in their line-of-sight. A cooperative perception system among vehicles increases their situational awareness by extending their perception range. Existing solutions focus on improving perspective transformation and fast information collection. However, such solutions fail to filter out large amounts of less relevant data and thus impose significant network and computation load. Moreover, presenting all this less relevant data can overwhelm the driver and thus actually hinder them. To address such issues, we present Augmented Informative Cooperative Perception (AICP), the first fast-filtering system which optimizes the informativeness of shared data at vehicles to improve the fused presentation. To this end, an informativeness maximization problem is presented for vehicles to select a subset of data to display to their drivers. Specifically, we propose (i) a dedicated system design with custom data structure and lightweight routing protocol for convenient data encapsulation, fast interpretation and transmission, and (ii) a comprehensive problem formulation and efficient fitness-based sorting algorithm to select the most valuable data to display at the application layer. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype of AICP with a bandwidth-hungry, latency-constrained real-life augmented reality application. The prototype adds only 12.6 milliseconds of latency to a current informativeness-unaware system. Next, we test the networking performance of AICP at scale and show that AICP effectively filters out less relevant packets and decreases the channel busy time.

AB PurposeThis study aims to explore and ranks the factors that might determine attitudes and intentions toward using autonomous vehicles (AVs).Design/methodology/approachThe "technology acceptance model" (TAM) was extended by assessing the moderating influences of personal-related factors. Data were collected from 378 Vietnamese and analysed using a combination of "partial least squares" and the "adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system" (ANFIS) technique.FindingsThe findings demonstrated the power of TAM in explaining the attitude and intention to use AVs. ANFIS enables ranking the importance of determinants and predicting the outcomes. Perceived ease of use and attitude were the most crucial drivers of attitude and intention to use AVs, respectively. Personal innovativeness negatively moderates the influence of perceived ease of use on attitude. Data privacy concerns moderate positively the impact of perceived usefulness on attitude. The moderating effect of price sensitivity was not supported.Practical implicationsThese findings provide insights for policymakers and automobile companies' managers, designers and marketers on driving factors in making decisions to adopt AVs.Originality/valueThe study extends the AVs literature by illustrating the importance of personal-related factors, ranking the determinants of attitude and intention, illustrating the inter-relationships among AVs adoption factors and predicting individuals' attitudes and behaviours towards using AVs.

AB E-commerce retailers face the challenge to assemble a large number of time-critical picking orders. Common parts-to-picker autonomous intelligent warehouses such as automated vehicle storage and retrieval system and robotic mobile fulfillment system are often a little ill-suited for these prerequisites. A mixed-robotic fulfillment system is a hybrid robot picking system based on multi-device collaboration. It is a fusion innovation of traditional automated vehicle storage and retrieval system and robotic mobile fulfillment system. This paper comprehensively considers the characteristics of the system and customer demand, through the construction of a queuing network model to evaluate the performance of the system. A series of problems such as order service time, throughput capacity, and vehicle quantity configuration are analyzed experimentally. The validity of the model is verified by a simulation model.

DT Article
AB The Ocean Technology Southampton Oceanography designed, built and recently successfully field-tested the AUTOSUB-1 autonomous underwater vehicle. This paper describes the development, design, and testing of the navigation and control systems.
   The system is based upon a modular, distributed, architecture, with fourteen network nodes carrying out the essential vehicle navigation, control, monitor and safety functions. The paper will show how the use of this architecture has contributed to the speed of system implementation, lest and integration, and will simplify the integration of future system enhancements.
   The navigation system uses the global positioning system (GPS) or differential GPS (DGPS) position fixes when surfaced, and dead-reckons when submerged, using a Doppler velocity log. Separate nodes control the vehicle depth, position and speed. The mission control mode is an event-driven command interpreter which co-ordinates activities and issues demands to the control nodes via the network.

ID HAMILTONIAN ADAPTIVE-CONTROL
AB Featured Application Autonomous unmanned vehicles, deterministic artificial intelligence. Unmanned ocean vehicles can be guided and controlled autonomously or remotely, and even remote operation can be automated significantly. Classical methods use trajectory tracking errors in negative feedback. Recently published methods are proposed instead. Deterministic (non-stochastic) artificial intelligence (DAI) combines optimal learning with an asserted self awareness statement in the form of the governing mathematical model (based on physics in this instantiation) to allow control that can be alternatively adaptive (i.e., capable of reacting to changing system dynamics) or learning (i.e., able to provide information about what aspects of the system dynamics have changed). In this manuscript, deterministic artificial intelligence is applied to the heading control of a simulated remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV). Research is presented illustrating autonomous control of a Seabotix vLBV 300 remotely operated vehicle within milli-degrees on the very first step of a shaped square wave command, and error decreased an additional sixty-two percent by the third step of the square wave command.

ID COLLISION-AVOIDANCE; GAME-THEORY
AB Collision avoidance is an essential component of an autonomous robotic system. This paper presents CONCORD, a novel decision-making system for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) conflict resolution that uses the notion of correlated equilibrium. Correlated equilibrium is a solution concept in game theory, which is computationally light and gives a better-expected payoff to every player. This paper proposes an intelligent semi-autonomous conflict resolution system for aerial vehicles. The vehicles are the players, and the resolutions are the equilibrium strategies of the game. CONCORD monitors the vehicles to predict conflicts and compute strategies leading to equilibrium. The cases of cooperative, non-cooperative, and multiple vehicles are discussed, emphasizing decision making and its corresponding timelines. Monte Carlo simulations are also performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The proposed framework is compared with two other baselines and a Nash-equilibrium-based resolution to highlight its effectiveness. This work also presents the integration of CONCORD to an existing UAV traffic management system. The proposed module would enable conflict-free flight for a multi-UAV system in an efficient manner.

AB The problem of motion control of underwater vehicles in both the fully actuated and under-actuated configurations is often confronted by the marine technology community. This paper presents a nonlinear control method for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) traveling along a planned planar path in both actuation configurations. The common objectives of path-following control for both fully actuated and under-actuated vehicles are described, and the differences in the necessary path-following control designs are analyzed, showing that the side-slip angle of the vehicle plays an important role in the evolution of the dynamics of AUVs with different actuation configurations. Based on the presented analysis, nonlinear controllers for the two types of AUV configurations are proposed, and the inherent characteristics of under-actuation and full actuation are revealed by a dedicated analysis of numerical simulation paradigms, the results of which will be instrumental in guiding marine technology engineers in the practical design and control of AUVs.

DE Cooperative platoon forming; Vehicle platoon; Mixed traffic flow; Fuel

AB Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) platoon was recently proposed to improve road utilization and reduce fuel consumption. However, the mixed traffic flow of CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) will exist on the road for a long time; thus, the organiza-tion of CAVs needs to be reconsidered from the aspects of the platoon forming strategy. In this paper, a novel cooperative platoon forming (CPF) strategy is proposed to enhance the formation of CAV platoons in mixed traffic flows. A four-lane cellular automaton traffic modeling framework is constructed to simulate the interaction between CAVs and HDVs. Numerical results show that the CPF strategy is effective in enabling CAVs to be assembled into platoons. The increase in the CAV penetration rate can effectively alleviate traffic congestion and improve traffic capacity, thereby improving traffic flow and fuel economy. The findings may help improve the management of vehicle platoons.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SYSTEMS
AB This paper presents an adaptive nonlinear controller for diving control of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). So far, diving dynamics of an AUV has often been derived under various assumptions on the motion of the vehicle. Typically, the pitch angle of AUV has been assumed to be small in the diving plane. However, these kinds of assumptions may induce large modeling errors and further may cause severe problems in many practical applications. In this paper, through a certain simple modification, we break the above restricting condition on the vehicle's pitch angle in diving motion so that the vehicle could take free pitch motion. Proposed adaptive nonlinear controller is designed by using a traditional backstepping method. Finally, certain numerical studies are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of proposed control scheme, and some practical features of the control law are also discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Autonomous vehicles, also known as self-driving cars, have the capability to perceive the environment, locate its position, and safely drive to the destination without any human intervention. This field has made amazing improvements because of the advanced technologies and progress of the artificial intelligence (AI) field. While the existing surveys have addressed many topics, e.g., vehicle sensors, perception, and object detection, none of the existing works summarize the work studying the ability of human-like understanding, e.g., common sense reasoning. Therefore, in this article, we present a novel system flow for empowering autonomous vehicles to understand the traffic scene and summarize the state of the art research.

AB There is an increasing awareness of the need to reduce traffic accidents and fatality due to vehicle collision. Post-impact hazards can be more serious as the driver may fail to maintain effective control after collisions. To avoid subsequent crash events and to stabilize the vehicle, this paper proposes a post-impact motion planning and stability control method for autonomous vehicles. An enabling motion planning method is proposed for post-impact situations by combining the polynomial curve and artificial potential field while considering obstacle avoidance. A hierarchical controller that consists of an upper and a lower controller is then developed to track the planned motion. In the upper controller, a time-varying linear quadratic regulator is presented to calculate the desired generalized forces. In the lower controller, a nonlinear-optimization-based torque allocation algorithm is proposed to optimally coordinate the actuators to realize the desired generalized forces. The proposed scheme is verified under comprehensive driving scenarios through hardware-in-loop tests.

AB This paper focuses on the lateral control of intelligent vehicles; the aim is to minimize the lateral displacement of the autonomous vehicle with respect to a given reference path. The control input is the steering angle and the output is the lateral displacement error. We present the design and validation of a robust lateral controller based on the Immersion and Invariance (I&I) principle in order to ensure robust stability and good performances with respect to parametric variations and uncertainties that are encountered in driving applications. To validate our control law, tests were performed on SCANeR Studio, a driving simulation engine, according to several real driving scenarios. Simulations were also performed using experimental data acquired by the DYNA vehicle (a Peugeot 308) belonging to the Heudiasyc laboratory. The validation demonstrates the robustness and good performances of the proposed control approach and clearly shows the improvement due to the 1811 controller. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

DE Automated driving; V2X; cooperative collision avoidance
ID PERFORMANCE; NETWORKS
AB In this paper, we consider a cooperative autonomous driving system where a vehicle overtakes the one in front based on collective perception. To avoid collisions with vehicles on the other lane, we propose a V2X-based cooperative collision avoidance scheme. The overtaking vehicle estimates the distance between itself and the neighbors via V2V communications and decides whether to overtake or not. Two cases where the distance information is obtained independently and cooperatively are taken into account. We derive the probability of collision avoidance and analyze the influence of different factors such as speed and density of vehicles on the system performance. Simulation results verify our analysis and show that our V2X-based cooperative collision avoidance scheme performs better than traditional GNSS-based collision avoidance scheme. The performance gain brought by the cooperative case compared to the independent case in our scheme can also be observed.

AB This work presents a possible solution to one of the major causal of traffic accidents in urban environment as well as in highways: the high speed on the part of the drivers. The developed system is based on the combination of on easy low-cost sensor-data wireless network and a commercial vehicle that has been modified in order to carry out an autonomous driving. The system here presented is based on the combination of sensory information coming from the infrastructure - Zigbee sensors - with the communication of this information to the vehicles to adapt the speed in function of the external environment. The system has been tested in the private driving circuit at the IAI-CSIC facilities through a vehicle equipped with the necessary instrumentation to carry out the longitudinal control of the vehicle break and throttle pedals - autonomously. There have been realized three experiments in real traffic conditions: a speed control before a risk curve, on automatic control of a pedestrian crossing and a crossing vehicle. They show the good behavior of the designed system.

AB In public road tests of autonomous vehicles in California, rear-end crashes have been the most common type of crash. Collision avoidance systems, such as autonomous emergency braking (AEB), have provided an effective way for autonomous vehicles to avoid collisions with the lead vehicle, but to avert false alarms, AEB tends to apply late and hard brake only if a collision becomes unavoidable. Automatic preventive braking (APB) is a new collision avoidance method used in Mobileye's Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) model that aims to reduce crashes with a milder brake and decreased impact on traffic flow, but APB's safety performance is inferior to that of AEB. This study therefore proposes three safety improvement strategies for APB, the addition of response time, safety buffer, and minimum following distance; and combines them in different ways into four improved APB systems, IP1-IP4. Simulating car-following safety-critical events (SCEs) extracted from the Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study in MATLAB's Simulink, the safety performance, conservativeness, and driving comfort of the four systems were evaluated and compared with the original APB system, two AEB systems, and human drivers. The results show that 1) IP4, the system that integrated all three strategies, outperformed the baseline APB and IP1IP3 and prevented all SCEs from becoming crashes; 2) IP4 was slightly more conservative than AEB, but less conservative than RSS; 3) APB's jerk-bounded braking profile improved driving comfort; and 4) higher deceleration was found in the two AEB systems (both 8.1 m/s2) than in IP4 (6.7 m/s2), but they failed to prevent all crashes. Our proposed APB system, IP4, can provide safe, efficient, and comfortable braking for AVs in carfollowing SCEs, and has the potential to be practically applied in vehicle collision avoidance systems.

AB Communication delays are a crucial issue in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) formation control. To solve this issue, this article for the first time develops an active communication delay compensation (ACDC) mechanism with an innovatively developed data-driven state predictor (DDSP) of AUVs. The DDSP of each AUV can online estimate the current motion states of its neighbors solely depending on its received delayed motion state information of its neighbors. Incorporating the ACDC, prescribed performance control method, and neural networks into the backstepping approach, this article proposes a distributed 3-D time-varying formation prescribed performance control strategy, where a novel auxiliary dynamic system is created to alleviate the adverse effect of input saturations. The proposed formation control strategy ensures AUVs to maintain the desired 3-D time-varying formation pattern, while achieving the asymptotic stability with respect to formation errors and satisfying the performance constraints simultaneously. Simulations are performed to validate our proposed formation control strategy.
