ID EXTENDED OBJECT TRACKING; TARGET TRACKING
AB High-resolution radar sensors are able to resolve multiple detections per object and, therefore, provide valuable information for vehicle environment perception. For instance, multiple detections allow us to infer the size of an object or to measure the object's motion more precisely. Yet, the increased amount of data raises the demands on tracking modules; measurement models that are able to process multiple detections for an object are necessary and measurement-to-object associations become more complex. This paper presents a new variational radar model for tracking vehicles using radar detections and demonstrates how this model can be incorporated into a randomfinite-set-based multi-object filter. The measurement model is learned from actual data using variational Gaussian mixtures and avoids excessive manual engineering. In combination with the multi-object tracker, the entire process chain from raw measurements to the resulting tracks is formulated probabilistically. The presented approach is evaluated on experimental data, and it is demonstrated that the data-driven measurement model outperforms a manually designed model.

ID HYDRODYNAMIC COEFFICIENTS
AB Rapid control systems prototyping have been used to develop controllers for numerous applications. However, most methods are constrained by programming language, embedded systems configurations, and types of operating systems used. These constraints often make the modeling, control systems design and testing difficult to accomplish, and inflexible when dealing with complex mechatronics systems such as an underwater robotic vehicle (URV) before it has been fully developed. With the proposed xPC Target platform, dynamics of the URV including the hydrodynamics parameters can be experimentally determined, simulated and validated easily with computational fluid dynamic method. The experiment with a robust sliding-mode control of the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) using the dynamic model obtained is first shown. In the pool trials, the sliding-mode controller deems to be robust enough to control the top control surface angular position despite of the uncertainties in the hydrodynamic parameters obtained and the external disturbance during pool test.

AB The emerging connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technology is likely to bring significant changes to the transportation world. This study helps understand how the anticipated emergence of CAVs will affect various aspects of society and transportation, including travel demand, vehicle miles traveled, energy consumption, and emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. We design a set of future system configurations under the California Statewide Travel Demand Model framework to simulate scenarios for the deployment of passenger CAVs in California by 2050. These scenarios consider the ownership and operational type (e.g., private and shared) of CAVs, as well as additional policies such as pricing and the use of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) to curb potential impacts. The scenarios are: 0. Baseline (no automation); 1. Private CAV; 2. Private CAV + Pricing; 3. Private CAV + ZEV; 4. Shared CAV; 5. Shared CAV + Pricing; 6. Shared CAV + ZEV. Impacts of the introduction of CAVs across the transportation system are quantitatively estimated. The results indicate that the mode shares of public transit and in-state air travel will likely sharply decrease, while total vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and emissions will likely increase, because of the relative convenience of CAVs. The results also show that VMT could be substantially affected by a modification in auto travel costs. This means that the implementation of pricing strategies and congestion pricing policies, together with policies that support the deployment of shared and electric CAVs, could help reduce tailpipe pollutant emissions in future scenarios.

AB To address the safety and efficiency issues of vehicles at multi-lane merging zones, a cooperative decision-making framework is designed for connected automated vehicles (CAVs) using a coalitional game approach. Firstly, a motion prediction module is established based on the simplified single-track vehicle model for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the decision-making algorithm. Then, the cost function and constraints of the decision making are designed considering multiple performance indexes, i.e. the safety, comfort and efficiency. Besides, in order to realize human-like and personalized smart mobility, different driving characteristics are considered and embedded in the modeling process. Furthermore, four typical coalition models are defined for CAVS at the scenario of a multi-lane merging zone. Then, the coalitional game approach is formulated with model predictive control (MPC) to deal with decision making of CAVs at the defined scenario. Finally, testings are carried out in two cases considering different driving characteristics to evaluate the performance of the developed approach. The testing results show that the proposed coalitional game based method is able to make reasonable decisions and adapt to different driving characteristics for CAVs at the multi-lane merging zone. It guarantees the safety and efficiency of CAVs at the complex dynamic traffic condition, and simultaneously accommodates the objectives of individual vehicles, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is an important tool for intelligent ocean applications, which can be applied to detect underwater environment and search target. Path planning is the key technology to realize AUV intelligence, which has important research significance. Aiming at the dynamic path planning problem, the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) was first applied to the AUV three-dimensional (3D) dynamic path planning, and a Gate Recurrent Unit Proximal Policy Optimization with Local Vision (GPPO-LV) model based on local vision is proposed. The 3D ocean current environment is constructed based on the ROMS simulation data. The local vision matrix is constructed based on underwater images, and the features of local vision are extracted using convolutional neural network. Furthermore, Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) network is used to mine the hidden information between observation states. Finally, the Actor network for strategy output and the Critical network for action value evaluation are constructed, and strategies are optimized in the process of interaction with the environment. The experiment shows that under various unknown environments, AUV can carry out real-time path planning under real ocean current data, and has good obstacle avoidance ability.

AB Currently, the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in natural and complex environments has been increasing, because they are appropriate and affordable solutions to support different tasks such as rescue, forestry, and agriculture by collecting and analyzing high-resolution monocular images. Autonomous navigation at low altitudes is an important area of research, as it would allow monitoring parts of the crop that are occluded by their foliage or by other plants. This task is difficult due to the large number of obstacles that might be encountered in the drone's path. The generation of high-quality depth maps is an alternative for providing real-time obstacle detection and collision avoidance for autonomous UAVs. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of four supervised learning deep neural networks and a combination of two for monocular depth map estimation considering images captured at low altitudes in simulated natural environments. Our results show that the Boosting Monocular network is the best performing in terms of depth map accuracy because of its capability to process the same image at different scales to avoid loss of fine details.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB To solve the long-tail problem and improve the testing efficiency for autonomous navigation systems of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), a visual image-based navigation scene complexity perception method is proposed. In this paper, we intend to accurately construct a mathematical model between navigation scene complexity and visual features from the analysis and processing of image textures. First, the typical complex elements are summarized, and the navigation scenes are divided into four levels according to whether they contain these typical elements. Second, the textural features are extracted using the gray level cogeneration matrix (GLCM) and Tamura coarseness, which are applied to construct the feature vectors of the navigation scenes. Furthermore, a novel paired bare bone particle swarm clustering (PBBPSC) method is proposed to classify the levels of complexity, and the exact value of the navigation scene complexity is calculated using the clustering result and an interval mapping method. By comparing different methods on the classical and self-collected datasets, the experimental results show that our proposed complexity perception method can not only better describe the level of complexity of navigation scenes but also obtain more accurate complexity values.

AB The emergence of autonomous vehicles (AVs) may shape the future landscape of urban mobility. Although there is a growing literature on public opinions with regard to self-driving, little attention has been explicitly given to the commuters and their preferences for their commute trips. Using data from the 2015 and 2017 Puget Sound Regional Household Travel Studies, this study investigates the factors associated with employees' propensity for using AVs. We develop a bivariate ordered probit model to jointly estimate the determinants of levels of interest in (i) commuting alone using AVs and (ii) commuting with others using shared AVs. Not surprisingly, it was found that current solo drivers are more likely to commute alone using AVs compared with other mode users. Significant differences were not found between current drivers and other commuters when it comes to the potential use of shared AVs. The results also reveal that, controlling for other factors, commuters surveyed in 2017 are less likely to be interested in shared AVs compared with their 2015 counterparts. The conclusion is that more planning efforts are needed to support the market penetration of shared AVs.

AB This paper addresses the robust stabilization of a relative equilibrium for an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with disturbances rejection. The AUV's dynamics is described by the Hamiltonian equation in the presence of unknown external disturbances and uncertain hydrodynamic damping. The disturbances arising from slowly varying currents are assumed to be constant, which consists of matched disturbances and unmatched disturbances, simultaneously. The unmatched disturbances and the uncertain damping that make the realization of the system stabilization become more challenging. To achieve the control objective, first, a new Hamiltonian equation, which is stable around the desired relative equilibrium, is designed to serve as the closed-loop dynamics in which an integral action is added to suppress the disturbances. By matching the closed-loop equation and the open-loop equation, an anti-disturbance stabilizing controller is presented, which requires the knowledge of the uncertain damping. Then, the adaptive control method is employed to propose an improved controller, which enhances the robustness of the uncertain damping. The stability is analyzed by the Lyapunov method. The numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the obtained result.

AB It is a challengeable task to plan multi-objective optimization paths for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in an unknown environments, which involves reducing travel time, shortening path length, keeping navigation safety, and smoothing trajectory. To address the above challenges, a real-time path planning approach combining particle swarm optimization and waypoint guidance is proposed for AUV in unknown oceanic environments in this paper. In this algorithm, a multi-beam forward looking sonar (FLS) is utilized to detect obstacles and the output data of FLS are used to produce those obstacles' outlines (polygons). Particle swarm optimization is used to search for appropriate temporary waypoints, in which the optimization parameters of path planning are taken into account. Subsequently, an optimal path is automatically generated under the guidance of the destination and these temporary waypoints. Finally, three algorithms, including artificial potential field and genic algorithm, are adopted in the simulation experiments. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can generate the optimal paths compared with the other two algorithms.

AB Instrumented unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) represent a new way of conducting atmospheric science, particularly within the atmospheric boundary layer where the air is turbulent. However, using autonomous UAVs for airborne measurement requires active control methods capable of following altitude commands despite unknown and turbulent disturbances to the air. Filtered dynamic inversion (FDI) is a control method with desirable command-following and disturbance-rejection properties for this application. FDI requires limited model information and is thus robust to parametric uncertainty, which arises in modeling UAV dynamics. In this paper, FDI is implemented in an altitude-flight-control system for an autonomous fixed-wing UAV. The control system is validated in simulation with a nonlinear dynamic model of a small fixed-wing UAV. The control system is also implemented and validated in flight experiments with turbulent wind conditions. Experimental results show that FDI yields improved altitude and pitch command following as compared to a classical (e.g., proportional-integral) flight-control system. In particular, experimental data demonstrate that the average power of the altitude and pitch command following errors with FDI is smaller than those with proportional-integral control.

TI Autonomy in unmanned air vehicles
SO AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL

DT Article
AB The paper describes a key risk area threatening the widespread deployment of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), that of attaining high levels of autonomy. Autonomy is loosely defined in the context of UAVs and the meaning of 'level of autonomy' discussed. The paper argues that the achievement of high levels of autonomy is not merely a function of increasing machine intelligence but also of maintaining the human operator's engagement with the decision making process and retaining human authority. An assumption is that a human being in the loop will be a requirement for safety, flight clearance and legal reasons on early systems. Therefore, developers of highly autonomous systems are presented with a paradox. It will be argued that the human must be placed at the centre of the design process and consequently human factors, the human machine interface and the system architecture become critical to achieving high levels of autonomy. This quality impacts on the entire knowledge acquisition and design cycle and broadens what is meant by that term placing it as a discipline firmly in the systems design community. The paper concludes by outlining the key barriers to the successful development of highly autonomous UAVs.

AB The low-speed high automation (LSHA) is foreseen as a development path for new types of mobility, improving road safety and addressing transit problems in urban infrastructures. As these automation approaches are still in the development phase, methods to improve their design and validation are required. The use of vehicle simulation models allows reducing significantly the time deployment on real test tracks, which would not consider all the scenarios or complexity related to automated driving features. However, to ensure safety and accuracy while evaluating the proper operation of LSHA features, adequate validation methodologies are mandatory. In this study a two-step validation methodology is proposed: Firstly, an open-loop test set attempts to tune the required vehicle simulation models using experimental data considering also the dynamics of the actuation devices required for vehicle automation. Secondly, a closed-loop test strives to validate the selected automated driving functionality based on test plans, also improving the vehicle dynamics response. To illustrate the methodology, a study case is proposed using an automated Renault Twizy. In the first step, the brake pedal and steering wheel actuators' behavior is modeled, as well as its longitudinal dynamics and turning capacity. Then, in a second step, an LSHA functionality for Traffic Jam Assist based on a Model Predictive Control approach is evaluated and validated. Results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is capable not only to tune vehicle simulation models for automated driving development purposes but also to validate LSHA functionalities.

AB In this article, the problem of autonomous vehicle trajectory optimization with flexible final time is concerned under the consideration of stochastic disturbances. Stochastic differential dynamic programming (SDDP) has been widely applied to address this type of problem due to its fast convergence and capability to handle model errors. Typically, traditional SDDP is designed with a deterministic final time, which is mainly assigned based on expert experiences. However, this may limit the implementation of this approach. To deal with this issue, we define the final time as a new optimal variable and propose an enhanced version of SDDP, named flexible final-time SDDP. The stochastic dynamic system is then characterized as a deterministic one with random state perturbances. An unscented transform approach is utilized to cope with the perturbed expected values. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a 3-D missile trajectory optimization problem is tested as an example. The simulation results show that the proposed method is able to address the stochastic trajectory optimization problem and can provide stronger robustness compared to other algorithms.

AB In view of the requirements on control precision of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in different operations, the improvement of AUV motion control accuracy is the focus of this paper. In regard to the unsatisfying robustness of traditional control methods, an interactive network based on Least Square Support Vector Regression (LSSVR) is therefore put forward. The network completed the identification of the strong nonlinear AUV dynamic characteristics based on the LSSVR theory and by virtue of the interactions between the offline and online modules, it achieved offline design and online optimization of the AUV control law. In addition to contrastive numerical simulations and sea trials with the classic S-plane method in AUV velocity and heading control, the LSSVR network was also tested in path following and long-range cruise. The precision and robustness and of the proposed network were verified by the high-accuracy control results of the aforesaid simulations and trials. The network can be of practical use in AUV control especially under unfamiliar water conditions with access to a limited number of control samples or little information of the operation site.

AB Pervasive computing techniques provides application guidance and support for intelligent transportation systems. On the basis of connected autonomous vehicles, a extended model has been proposed. This paper focuses on studying the effects of the electronic throttle and driver's memory. In order to show the influence of these two factors on the model, the extended model is studied by theoretical analysis and numerical methods. Stability conditions are obtained by adding perturbation to the linear analysis, the TDGL equation and mKdV equation are derived by nonlinear analysis, which shows that the phase change behavior of traffic jams can be described by both of them. The numerical simulation results show the correctness of the analysis results. Numerical results show that the effects of driver's memory and electronic throttle play an key role in the stability of traffic flow, which is consistent with the theoretical analysis results.

AB This study aims to develop a fuzzy-based visual intelligent guidance system (VIGS) that executes missions involving the identification and tracking of underwater target objects for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). To demonstrate the VIGS functions, a series of tests were conducted in the stability tank and towing tank at National Cheng Kung University. The characteristic of the VIGS is to immediately capture continuous real-time images from the bow to calculate and identify visual information concerning the AUV's surroundings. By mapping the target's information in the AUV visual coordinate system (two-dimensional) onto the earth-fixed coordinates (three-dimensional), the relationships of corresponding distance and azimuth between the target and the AUV were defined. Eventually, this information was used to calculate the control parameters of the AUV's moving speed and heading angle, completing the visual motion control framework. In the dynamic guidance experiments, the moving speed of the target object is proved to be a predominant factor leading to different trends of AUV's steering performances for pitch and yaw controls.

AB Human error is one of the leading causes of accidents. Distraction, fatigue, poor visibility, speeding, and other such errors made by drivers can cause accidents. With the rapid advancements in automation technologies, transportation planners have strived to use Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to minimize human error. In this study, the effect of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) on the number of potential conflicts at two unsignalized intersections is investigated by using a microsimulation model in PTV Vissim software. For human-driven cars, the factor that is considered for calibration is driver distraction mainly caused by reading or writing text messages on a cellphone while driving. This factor can be estimated using driving simulators. In this paper, five different scenarios were defined for simulation, in addition to the primary state, according to the different market penetration rates of AVs in Vissim. Safety assessment was performed by the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM) using Tune to Collision (TTC) and Deceleration Rate to Avoid Crashes (DRAC) indicators to determine the number of accidents. It was concluded that the presence of 100% of AVs could reduce the potential for accidents by up to 93%.

AB The crown jewel of intelligent transportation is achieving autonomous driving that can ultimately become accident- and congestion-free through CAVs and the associated traffic management systems. Recently, this vision has sparked huge research interest, such as IoV, LTE-V2X, and 5G. However, the huge amount of traffic data generated by CAVs poses challenges for the current networks and even the upcoming 5G communication networks.In this article, we first analyze the communication requirements of CAVs and present the progress of vehicular communication networks, and on that basis propose the novel concept of VMBS and a VMBS-CCNA for CAVs. The VMBS plays multiple roles of a user node and edge computing node for external communication networks, and a base station and information caching node for CAVs, thus achieving the fusion of communication and computing for CAVs. To this end, we present both the VMBS-enabled wireless communication and computing for CAVs, and the VMBS-assisted wireless communication for other wireless devices. Several research challenges and some open research issues are highlighted and discussed. Finally, simulation results reveal that the proposed VMBS-CCNA can bring a significant improvement in terms of throughput, delay, and average number of links.

AB This paper addresses the problem of autonomous cooperative localization, grasping and delivering of colored ferrous objects by a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In the proposed scenario, a team of UAVs is required to maximize the reward by collecting colored objects and delivering them to a predefined location. This task consists of several subtasks such as cooperative coverage path planning, object detection and state estimation, UAV self-localization, precise motion control, trajectory tracking, aerial grasping and dropping, and decentralized team coordination. The failure recovery and synchronization job manager is used to integrate all the presented subtasks together and also to decrease the vulnerability to individual subtask failures in real-world conditions. The whole system was developed for the Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC) 2017, where it achieved the highest score and won Challenge No. 3-Treasure Hunt. This paper does not only contain results from the MBZIRC 2017 competition but it also evaluates the system performance in simulations and field tests that were conducted throughout the year-long development and preparations for the competition.

AB This paper investigates adaptive fault tolerant control and fault reconstruction problem for AUV subject to ocean current disturbance and modelling uncertainty. At first, a virtual closed-loop system based adaptive fault tolerant control method is developed. In this method, the constructed virtual closed-loop system is mainly used to deal with the influence of the initial tracking error in an ideal environment and avoid the serious chattering phenomenon in control output. Then with respect to fault reconstruction in the framework of fault tolerant control, an improved second-order sliding mode observer is constructed to estimate the thruster fault effect. The feedback of the developed observer consists of different functions of the estimation errors, including fractional function, signature function and integral function etc. Furthermore, the stability analysis is given based on Lyapunov theory. Finally, a series of simulations are performed on an over-actuated AUV for different desired trajectories and different types of thruster faults under the condition of the simulated ocean current environment. The comparative simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the new design.

AB In many applications, the industrial environments are typically 3-D indoor spaces enclosed by shell style structures, which are highly complex with known or unknown non-convex obstacles. GPS signal is unreliable or even unavailable inside, which poses significant technical challenges for the state estimation of micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) performing exploration and modeling tasks in such environments. In this paper, requirements and challenges for 3-D enclosed industrial environments exploration are analyzed firstly, and then state-of-art developments of MAV systems, environment modeling, visual navigation and guidance technologies are reviewed. A robust RGB-D odometry is introduced into the system to provide airborne 6-DOF state estimates of the MAV, which are fused with inertial measurements. Then the fused state information is used to assist the RGB-D based real time 3-D environment modeling. An improved closed-loop RRT based path planning approach (BI-RRT) is developed for information-efficient environment explorations. A flight experimental platform is constructed and the proposed system is validated in flight experiments. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Modern auto-vehicles are built upon a vast collection of sensors that provide large amounts of data processed by dozens of Electronic Control Units (ECUs). These, in turn, monitor and control advanced technological systems providing a large palette of features to the vehicle's end-users (e.g., automated parking, autonomous vehicles). As modern cars become more and more interconnected with external systems (e.g., cloud-based services), enforcing privacy on data originating from vehicle sensors is becoming a challenging research topic. In contrast, deliberate manipulations of vehicle components, known as tampering, require careful (and remote) monitoring of the vehicle via data transmissions and processing. In this context, this paper documents an efficient methodology for data privacy protection, which can be integrated into modern vehicles. The approach leverages the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) as a core data transformation algorithm, accompanied by filters and additional transformations. The methodology is seconded by a Random Forest-based regression technique enriched with further statistical analysis for tampering detection in the case of anonymized data. Experimental results, conducted on a data set collected from the On-Board Diagnostics (OBD II) port of a 2015 EUR6 Skoda Rapid 1.2 L TSI passenger vehicle, demonstrate that the restored time-domain data preserves the characteristics required by additional processing algorithms (e.g., tampering detection), showing at the same time an adjustable level of privacy. Moreover, tampering detection is shown to be 100% effective in certain scenarios, even in the context of anonymized data.

AB The lack of visual information from the driver of the target vehicle makes it difficult to detect the intention of the target vehicle early before the start of the lane-change maneuver. Moreover, in current studies, the prerequisite for the successful application of intention detection models is to obtain a sufficient number of lane-change maneuver samples covering various scenarios and characteristics. Thus, a universal detector may not be optimal for lane-change intention detection in different scenarios in the real world. In this paper, we propose an intent detection method based on online transfer learning (OTL). First, a passive-aggressive (PA) algorithm is adopted to construct a lane-change source classifier with a large number of lane-change maneuvers as training samples. These samples contain the motion parameters of the vehicle before changing lanes, and the relative motion relationship between the target vehicle and the surrounding vehicles. Then, an OTL strategy that automatically and dynamically updates the weights is designed to detect the intention of the target vehicle to change lanes. The construction of the source classifier is supported by Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) natural driving data, and the verification of the intention predictions exploits data collected from real natural driving experiments. The performance analysis results demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully detect lane-change intention 3 s before the start of the lane-change maneuver, with an accuracy of 93.0%.

AB Unmanned aircraft or drones as they are sometimes called are continuing to become part of more real-life applications. The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles in public airspace is becoming an important issue that should be addressed. As the number of unmanned aerial vehicles and their applications are largely increasing, air traffic with more unmanned aircraft has to be given more attention to prevent collisions and maintain safe skies. Unmanned aerial vehicle air traffic integration and regulation has become a priority to different regulatory agencies and has become of greater interest for many researchers all around the world. In this research, a sampling-based air traffic integration, path planning, and collision avoidance approach is presented. The proposed algorithm expands an existing 2D sampling-based approach. The original 2D approach deals with only two unmanned aircraft. Each of the two aircraft shares location information with a ground-based path planner computer, which would send back the avoidance waypoints after performing the 2D sampling. The algorithm proposed in this article can handle any number of drones in the 3D space by performing either 2D or 3D sampling. The proposed work shows a 10-fold enhancement in terms of the number of unmanned aerial vehicle collisions. The presented results also contribute to enabling a better understanding of what is expected of integrating more drones in dense skies.

ID FRAMEWORK; FUSION
AB Accurately predicting maneuvers and trajectory of vehicles are essential prerequisites for intelligent systems such as autonomous vehicles to achieve safe and high-quality decision making and motion planning. Motions of each vehicle in a scene is governed by the traffic context, that is, the motion and relative spatial positions of neighboring vehicles, and is also affected by its motion inertia, that is, the trajectory history. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme based on Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) to conduct online multi-modal driving maneuvers and trajectory prediction. The motivation for this BiGRU based method relies on its enhanced prediction accuracy and computational efficiency in outputting the predicted results within the limited prediction horizon. We utilize a BiGRU to extract the complete history and future information of every point in the trajectory history sequence, apply dilated convolutional social (DCS) for learning interdependencies in vehicle motion, and subsequently use a GRU decoder model to make predictions. Additionally, our model simultaneously outputs a multi-modal predictive distribution over future trajectory and vehicle's behavior prediction results. We evaluate our model using the publicly available NGSIM US-101and I-80 datasets. Our results show improvements over the state-of-the-art in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values and Negative Log-Likelihoods (NLL). We also present a qualitative analysis of the model's predicted maneuvers and multi-model trajectories for various traffic scenarios.

AB The study proposes a cooperative lane changing strategy to improve traffic operation and safety at a diverging area nearby a highway off-ramp in an environment with connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). The cooperative strategy was implemented by the coordination of behaviors between the diverging vehicle and its cooperative vehicle on the target lane. The Minimizing Overall Braking Induced by Lane Changes Model (MOBIL) and Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) were modified to develop a simulation platform for a CAV environment. The optimal cooperative lane changing zones were firstly calculated by a heuristic algorithm, and then were applied in the simulation platform to implement the cooperative strategy. Various metrics were considered to evaluate the proposed strategy, including: total travel time, surrogate safety measures and traffic waves in the system. The experimental results showed that the length of the optimal cooperative zones obtained in our strategy were smaller than the fixed zone required in modified MOBIL strategy. Moreover, the results indicated that the cooperative strategy with the optimal zones, could improve traffic operation, traffic safety and traffic oscillation as compared to the modified MOBIL strategy with the fixed zone. The cooperative strategy can be potentially implemented nearby highway off-ramps by vehicle-based control, with the applications of the aforementioned cooperative zones.

AB The flocking and navigation control of large-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms have received a lot of research interest due to the wide applications of UAVs in many fields. Compared to traditional non-learning-based flocking and navigation control methods, reinforcement learning-based methods have advantages in model-free, flexibility, and adaptability. In this paper, we formulate the flocking and navigation control of the UAV swarm as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use multi-agent reinforcement learning methods to solve the problem. There are two significant challenges introduced by reinforcement learning: the scalability issue and the partial observations of each UAV. We adopt the independent learning and parameter sharing scheme to tackle the scalability issue, which extends the single-agent reinforcement learning algorithms to the multi-agent scenario. For the partial observations, we propose an oracle-guided two-stage training and execution scheme, which utilizes the flock center during the training phase but avoids the dependence on the flock center during the execution phase. We design the oracle-guided observations and rewards and build a highly efficient simulation environment to conduct experiments. Simulation results show that the policy trained with our method performs well with up to thirty-two UAVs and outperforms the policy trained with local observations.

DE Autonomous vehicles; collision avoidance; marine vehicles; motion
   planning; polygonal collision-avoidance constraints; trajectory
   optimization; trajectory planning
AB We propose a method for energy-optimized trajectory planning for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs), which can handle arbitrary polygonal maps as obstacle constraints. The method comprises two stages: The first is a hybrid A search that finds a dynamically feasible trajectory in a polygonal map on a discretized configuration space using optimal motion primitives. The second stage uses the resulting hybrid A trajectory as an initial guess to an optimal control problem (OCP) solver. In addition to providing the OCP with a warm start, we use the initial guess to create convex regions encoded as halfspace descriptions, which converts the inherent nonconvex obstacle constraints into a convex and smooth representation. The OCP uses this representation in order to optimize the initial guess within a collision-free corridor. The OCP solves the trajectory planning problem in continuous state space. Our approach solves two challenges related to optimization-based trajectory planning: The need for a dynamically feasible initial guess that can guide the solver away from undesirable local optima and the ability to represent arbitrary obstacle shapes as smooth constraints. The method can take into account external disturbances such as wind or ocean currents. We compare our method to two similar trajectory planning methods in simulation and have found significant computation time improvements. Additionally, we have validated the method in full-scale experiments in the Trondheim harbor area.

DE Autonomous underwater vehicle; multivariate time series classification;
   fault detection; hybrid feature; adaptive fusion
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) acquire large-scale multivariate time series (MTS) data during navigation, which can be utilised to realise fault diagnosis, condition monitoring, and other functions by means of classifying the monitoring data. However, due to the complexity and time-variation of relationships between many variables of the MTS, we propose a MTS classification method, namely hybrid feature adaptive fusion network (HFAF). Specifically, a multi-scale method is first proposed to generate monitoring windows with different scales, and the spatiotemporal information is then fully obtained by dilated convolutional neural network (D-CNN) and dilated recurrent neural network (D-RNN). Subsequently, an adaptive feature fusion network based on an attention mechanism is introduced to address the redundancy and conflict between different scales. Finally, the hybrid feature network and adaptive fusion network are stacked up to form HFAF. The effectiveness and superiority of HFAF in AUV fault detection are demonstrated by the experiments conducted on Haizhe AUV, which yields more than 96% precision and more than 95% recall for various faults, outperforming other fault detection methods.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with onboard embedded platforms and camera sensors provide access to difficult-to-reach areas and facilitate in remote sensing and autonomous decision-making capabilities in disaster recovery and management applications. Onboard computations are preferred due to connectivity, privacy, and latency problems. However, edge implementation becomes challenging because of limited onboard hardware resources (in terms of area, power, and storage). In this article, we propose a UAV assisted edge computation framework that compresses the convolutional neural network (CNN) models to be run on an onboard embedded graphics processing unit (GPU) for real-time disaster scenario classification. We use an imbalanced dataset named, Aerial Image Database for Emergency Response (AIDER), to replicate real-world disaster scenarios. Our experimental results show that optimized compressed model's throughput is increased by about 99% which is up to 92x faster than the native model. Furthermore, the model size reduction enabled through the proposed framework is about 84% without compromising accuracy and thus makes it suitable for edge GPUs.

AB We present TraEDITS, a novel traffic trajectory editing framework for autonomous vehicle testing, which can generate new traffic behaviors by controlling each vehicle interactively to increase the diversity or irregularity of traffic testing data. Given a traffic flow with its original trajectories, user's edits, environmental constraints, and physical constraints as input, our framework is able to generate an edited traffic flow through a global path planning module and a data-driven microscopic traffic flow simulation module. With the way-points from the user, our global planning module generates lane-level navigation by heuristic-based path planning in discrete space. By taking internal properties of the vehicle, velocity continuity, reference path, and collision avoidance into consideration, our simulation module generates vehicles' motions based on energy optimization driven by real traffic data. Given edits of the desired speed, the lateral deviation, or the reference path, our approach can generate a new trajectory of the selected vehicle, and adjust the surrounding vehicles' trajectories accordingly. As a result, our framework is able to simulate irregular or even rare events existing in real traffic. Meanwhile, our framework can enhance the diversity and irregularity of traffic behaviors and interactions by creating challenging scenarios like swerve, nudge, and U-turn. We validate the usability and plausibility of our framework through extensive experiments and user studies.

AB Guided transport vehicle (GTV) uses satellite positioning technology, lidar, and high performance video sensors to achieve real-time positioning and tracing, these devices cost a lot. In addition, GTV shifts left and right during operation due to there is no fixed orbits constraint. It is very important to detect the lateral offset in real time to ensure the accurate tracing of the vehicle along the dotted line. Aiming at the above issues, this paper proposes a low-cost high precision tracing method for GTV based on integrated positioning, high resolution estimation of the vehicles positioning information is implemented by Cubature Kalman filters (CKF) with a loosely coupled mode based on GPS/SINS in this method; Considering that GTV has a fixed driving route, a two-stage map matching algorithm based on Hidden Markov model (HMM) is proposed, which further improves the accuracy; The lateral offset distance is detected based on the positioning information, which provides theoretical support for the subsequent control of the precise operation of the vehicle. The algorithm's feasibility has been verified by real vehicle experiments, the results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a centimeter-level positioning accuracy, and when the lateral offset distance is not less than 65cm, the detection accuracy of the lateral offset distance is more than 92%.

AB In this paper, an advanced-and-reliable vehicle detection-and-tracking technique is proposed and implemented. The Real-TimeVehicle Detection-and-Tracking (RT_VDT) technique is well suited for Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) applications or Self-Driving Cars (SDC). The RT_VDT is mainly a pipeline of reliable computer vision and machine learning algorithms that augment each other and take in raw RGB images to produce the required boundary boxes of the vehicles that appear in the front driving space of the car. The main contribution of this paper is the careful fusion of the employed algorithms where some of them work in parallel to strengthen each other in order to produce a precise and sophisticated real-time output. In addition, the RT_VDT provides fast enough computation to be embedded in CPUs that are currently employed by ADAS systems. The particulars of the employed algorithms together with their implementation are described in detail. Additionally, these algorithms and their various integration combinations are tested and their performance is evaluated using actual road images, and videos captured by the front-mounted camera of the car as well as on the KITTI benchmark with 87% average precision achieved. The evaluation of the RT_VDT shows that it reliably detects and tracks vehicle boundaries under various conditions.

AB In recent years the application of driver steering models has extended from the off-line simulation environment to autonomous vehicles research and the support of driver assistance systems. For these new environments there is a need for the model to be adaptive in real time, so the supporting vehicle systems can react to changes in the driver, their driving style, mood and skill. This paper provides a novel means to meet these needs by combining a simple driver model with a single-track vehicle handling model in a parameter estimating filter - in this case, an unscented Kalman filter. Although the steering model is simple, a motion simulator study shows it is capable of characterising a range of driving styles and may also indicate the level of skill of the driver. The resulting filter is also efficient - comfortably operating faster than real time - and it requires only steer and speed measurements from the vehicle in addition to the reference path. Adaptation of the steer model parameters is demonstrated along with robustness of the filter to errors in initial conditions, using data from five test drivers in vehicle tests carried out on the open road.Abbreviations: ADAS: advanced driver assistance systems; CG: centre of gravity; CAN: controller area network; EKF: extended Kalman filter; GPS: global positioning system; UKF: unscented Kalman filter

AB While full automation of road vehicles remains a future goal, shared-control and semiautonomous driving-involving transitions of control between the human and the machine-are more feasible objectives in the near term. These alternative driving modes will benefit from new research toward novel steering control devices, more suitably where machine intelligence only partially controls the vehicle. In this article, it is proposed that when the human shares the control of a vehicle with an autonomous or semiautonomous system, a force control, or nondisplacement steering wheel (i.e., a steering wheel which does not rotate but detects the applied torque by the human driver) can be advantageous under certain schemes: tight rein or loose rein modes according to the H-metaphor. We support this proposition with the first experiments to the best of our knowledge, in which human participants drove in a simulated road scene with a force control steering wheel (FCSW). The experiments exhibited that humans can adapt promptly to force control steering and are able to control the vehicle smoothly. Different transfer functions are tested, which translate the applied torque at the FCSW to the steering angle at the wheels of the vehicle; it is shown that fractional order transfer functions increment steering stability and control accuracy when using a force control device. The transition of control experiments is also performed with both: a conventional and an FCSW. This prototypical steering system can be realized via steer-by-wire controls, which are already incorporated in commercially available vehicles.

AB Currently, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) utilizes global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) in conjunction with other modalities for localization purposes. Nevertheless, this approach faces robustness issues when GNSS signals become unavailable or sensors malfunction. Clearly, the robustness of the system increases considerably when multiple UAV agents are employed to perform collaborative positioning. In this work, an online distributed solution is proposed for relative localization, which incorporates multiple UAVs together with Signals of Opportunity (SOPs) as well as inertial, visual, and optical flow measurements. The proposed localization system includes relative self-localization of each UAV agent, as well as a reliable distributed relative positioning system (DRPS) for each UAV based on the relative positions from other UAV agents in its vicinity. The latter positioning strategy is required in case the relative self-localization fails, mainly due to such problems as inertial measurement unit (IMU) accumulated error drift, camera sensor errors, or SOP shortfalls due to multipath or antenna obstruction. Extensive field experiments validate the proposed technique and demonstrate increased localization accuracy and robustness when compared to the benchmark approach that does not include cooperation between UAVs.

ID ENTRY
AB Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) enables autonomous vehicles to perform complex decision making using neural networks. However, previous DRL networks only output decisions, so there is no way to determine whether the decision is proper. Reinforcement learning agents may continue to produce wrong decisions in unexpected environments not encountered during the learning process. In particular, one wrong decision can lead to an accident in autonomous driving. Therefore, it is necessary to indicate whether the action is a reasonable decision. As one such method, uncertainty can inform whether the agent's decision is appropriate for practical application where safety must be guaranteed. Therefore, this paper provides uncertainty in the decision by proposing DeepSet-Q with Gaussian mixture (DwGM-Q), which converges the existing DeepSet-Q and mixture density network (MDN). Calculating uncertainty with the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) produced from MDN made it possible to calculate faster than the existing ensemble method. Moreover, it verified how the agent responds to the unlearned situation through the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) simulator and compared the uncertainty of the decision between the learned and nontrained situation.

However, how to achieve UAV-enabled data dissemination and also ensure safe navigation synchronously is a new challenge. In this paper, our goal is minimizing the whole weighted sum of the UAV's task completion time while satisfying the data transmission task requirement and the UAV's feasible flight region constraints. However, it is unable to be solved via standard optimization methods mainly on account of lacking a tractable and accurate system model in practice. To overcome this tough issue, we propose a new solution approach by utilizing the most advanced dueling double deep Q network (dueling DDQN) with multi-step learning. Specifically, to improve the algorithm, the extra labels are added to the primitive states. Simulation results indicate the validity and performance superiority of the proposed algorithm under different data thresholds compared with two other benchmarks.

ID ROUTING PROBLEM; ALGORITHM
AB With the development of e-commerce, the last-mile delivery has become a significant part of customers' shopping experience. In this paper, an autonomous last-mile delivery method using multiple unmanned ground vehicles is investigated. Being a smart logistics service, it provides a promising solution to reduce the delivery cost, improve efficiency, and avoid the spread of airborne diseases, such as SARS and COVID-19. By using a cooperation strategy with multiple heterogeneous robots, contactiess parcel delivery can be carried out within apartment complexes efficiently. In this paper, the last-mile delivery with heterogeneous UGVs is formulated as an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the maximum makespan to complete all tasks. Then, a heuristic algorithm combining the Floyd's algorithm and PSO algorithm is proposed for task assignment and path planning. This algorithm is further realized in a distributed scheme, with all robots in a swarm working together to obtain the best task schedule. A good solution with an optimized makespan is achieved by considering the constraints of various robots in terms of speed and payload. Simulations and experiments are carried out and the obtained results confirm the validity and applicability of the developed approaches.

ID AUTOMATIC COLLISION-AVOIDANCE; DOMAIN
AB Unmanned vehicles have become a part of everyday life, not only in the air, but also at sea. In the case of sea, until now this usually meant small platforms operating near shores, usually for surveying or research purposes. However, experiments with larger cargo vessels, designed to operate on the high seas are already being carried out. In this context, there are questions about the threats that this solution may pose for other sea users, as well as the safety of the unmanned vehicle itself and the cargo or equipment on board. The problems can be considered in the context of system reliability as well as the resilience to interference or other intentional actions directed against these objects-for example, of a criminal nature. The paper describes the dangers that arise from the specificity of systems that can be used to solve navigational problems, as well as the analysis of the first experiences of the authors arising from the transit of an unmanned surface vessel (USV) from the United Kingdom to Belgium and back, crossing the busiest world shipping route-the English Channel.

AB An analysis is presented in this paper for a two-axis rate gyro subjected to linear feedback control mounted on a space vehicle, which is spinning with uncertain angular velocity omega(z)(t) about its spin of the gyro. For the autonomous case in which omega(z)(t) is steady, the stability analysis of the system is studied by Routh-Hurwitz theory. For the non-autonomous case in which omega(z)(t) is sinusoidal function, this system is a strongly non-linear damped system subjected to parametric excitation. By varying the amplitude of sinusoidal motion, periodic and chaotic responses of this parametrically excited non-linear system are investigated using the numerical simulation. Some observations on symmetry-breaking bifurcations, period-doubling bifurcations, and chaotic behavior of the system are investigated by various numerical techniques such as phase portraits, Poincare maps, average power spectra, and Lyapunov exponents. In addition, some discussions about chaotic motions of this system can be suppressed and changed into regular motions by a suitable constant motor torque are included. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In recent years, the integration of air vehicles and ground vehicles has been a technological development with huge potential. However, making both types of vehicle work together concurrently is a major challenge. Therefore, we have developed a novel cooperative communication protocol to efficiently implement the collaborative operation between an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). Through position sensing and time sensing, the UAV and UGV can achieve autonomous control by sending commands to each other. For example, the UGV can instantly pass a sensing-related task such as gas detection or obtaining a view of the ground from the air to the UAV, and the user can track the trajectory of the UAV flight through position sensing and time sensing to determine whether the UAV has done a task. Similarly, the UAV can send commands to the UGV to carry out sensing-related tasks such as face recognition and infrared thermal imaging of people on the ground. The UAV and UGV are not only equipped with a gas sensor and camera sensor, but they also have the built-in functions of position sensing and time sensing. According to experiments on the collaborative operation between UAVs and UGVs, the proposed approach enables the group deployment of unmanned vehicles to execute successfully three-dimensional collaborative operations that can be operated via an app without a ground control station. As a result, the proposed cooperative communication protocol through position sensing and time sensing efficiently realizes the IoT-connected group deployment of unmanned vehicles with sensing units.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are rapidly transforming the automotive industry due to rising consumer interest in these vehicles worldwide. However, few studies have compared different countries in terms of public acceptance of AVs. This study compares public acceptance of AVs as a function of risk perceptions in two countries leading the AV industry-Japan and Israel. We set our study within the risk-as-feelings framework. In contrast to "risk as analysis," which invokes factual reasoning to bear on risk assessment and decision making, "risk as feelings" takes affective cues such as the sense of dread and unfamiliarity into judgments of risk. To this end, we conducted two web-based surveys in Japan in 2017 and Israel in 2021. In a between-subjects design, we manipulated introductory video information to portray various combinations of risk factors commonly associated with AVs: system errors, external interferences with car controls (e.g., hacking), and the inability of the AV to cope with unexpected events. Next, participants were surveyed about how they perceive the risks of AVs and other well-known technologies and activities. Results showed that acceptable risk, perceived risk, and perceived benefit of AVs were all generally higher in Israel than in Japan. The opposite pattern was found for a "risk adjustment factor," suggesting that the Japanese seek more safety before acceptance than Israelis. Furthermore, we conducted a factor analysis on seven risk dimensions, resulting in a two-factor model of dread and unfamiliarity. Cognitive mapping of AVs and other technologies and activities in the two-factor plane revealed that the AV technologies we studied (i.e., AV-car levels 3 and 4; AV-bus levels 3 and 4) have high unfamiliarity risk but moderate dread risk compared to technologies and activities such as smoking, flying, and handguns. After exposure to video-based educational content, unfamiliarity risk was less influential but dread risk-in particular, related to human-made risks-became more influential. The results indicated that manufacturers and policymakers should emphasize mitigating human-made risks instead of focusing on improving public familiarity with AVs to garner trust and improve public acceptance of the technology.

AB Automated Vehicles (AVs) will change the transportation landscape in still-uncertain ways. The timeline for this change depends not just on the pace of technological advancement, but also on public attitudes about AVs. These attitudes include perceptions of safety and tolerance of new vehicle ownership structures that will likely emerge when and if fully self-driving models are available. This study aims to determine the extent to which young people are open to using AVs and forgoing ownership of conventional personal vehicles in favor of AV-based shared mobility. With the potential for widespread AV deployment in the near term, the perspectives of this age group are important for understanding the impacts of AVs on the mobility landscape. An online survey was distributed through professional networks across the country in early 2020 to gauge comfort levels in riding in AVs, relying on shared mobility, and owning an AV. Univariate and bivariate chi-square tests were performed to test the correlation between explanatory variables and perceptions of AVs. The responses revealed ambivalence toward AVs. Significant relationships indicate that gender identity and urbanicity matter when it comes to willingness to use AVs and shared mobility. Results also show that young adults may not be as ready for AVs as some have hypothesized. The results of this study help address gaps in AV perception research and gauge current attitudes of young adults toward a future of transportation that includes connected and automated vehicles.

AB Understanding how drivers behave at stop-controlled intersection is of critical importance for the control and management of an urban traffic system. It is also a critical element of consideration in the burgeoning field of smart infrastructure and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV). A number of past efforts have been devoted to investigating the driver behavioral patterns when they pass through stop-controlled intersections. However, the majority of these studies have been limited to qualitative descriptions and analyses of driver behavior due to the unavailability of high-resolution vehicle data and sound methodology for classifying various driver behaviors. In this paper, we introduce a methodology that uses computer-vision vehicle trajectory data and unsupervised clustering techniques to classify different types of driver behaviors, infer the underlying mechanism and compare their impacts on safety. Two major types of behaviors are investigated, including vehicle stopping behavior and vehicle approaching patterns, using two clustering algorithms: a bisecting K-means algorithm for classifying stopping behavior, and the improved density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm for classifying vehicle approaching patterns. The methodology is demonstrated using a case study involving five stop-controlled intersections in Montreal, Canada. The results from the analysis show that there exist five distinctive classes of driver behaviors representing different levels of risk in both vehicle stopping and approaching processes. This finding suggests that the proposed methodology could be applied to develop new safety surrogate measures and risk analysis methods for network screening and countermeasure analyses of stop-controlled intersections.

AB This paper examines the performance of multiple autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation using a static landmark AUV with respect to estimation accuracy, survey efficiency, and system cost. An alternating landmark navigation system has previously been developed in which moving AUVs estimate their states from a stationary AUV on the seafloor. Observational coverage can be expanded by alternating the landmark role among all AUVs. This paper focuses on how to extend the method in two or more AUV cases. In the extended method, two AUVs alternate between the moving and landmark roles, while other AUVs move and estimate their own states from the landmark AUV. It is expected that as the number of AUVs increased, survey efficiency would be improved because all AUVs except the landmark AUV can navigate simultaneously. All the AUVs can achieve accurate state estimation because of the landmark AUV. Through navigational simulation in cases of 3 to 30 AUVs, the performance was examined in terms of estimation accuracy, efficiency, and cost of the system. It was verified that the method can achieve low-cost high-performance seafloor surveying by selecting the most suitable navigation style for each mission.

AB Bathymetric simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) holds high potential for accurate navigation in long endurance autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) missions. Due to nearly flat seabed topography, the occurrence of invalid loop closures is unavoidable in bathymetric SLAM. Thus, invalid loop closure identification is a crucial component of bathymetric SLAM, a procedure that normally requires a substantial amount of computational resources. An efficient bathymetric SLAM method considering invalid loop closures is proposed in this article, which identifies invalid loop closures via PF-Backend, a robust back end method based on particle filtering theory. Using this set-up, all beliefs of historical loop closures are estimated by a small number of particles and, for each particle, the corresponding map consistency calculated via a global graph optimizer is applied as the measurement update in the particle filter. A loop closure solidification procedure is also discussed to decrease the number of particles in the PF-Backend. The new algorithm is shown to be efficient and capable of providing accurate location and mapping results using play-back experiments.

ID CHALLENGED ENVIRONMENTS; WIRELESS; COMMUNICATION; CAPACITY
AB Underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) based on magnetic induction (MI) have been recently proposed as a promising candidate for underwater networking due to its benefits, such as small transmission delay, low vulnerability to environment changes, multipath fading negligibility, and high bandwidth. Most of the UWSN applications are location dependent and, thus, localization plays an important functionality for obtaining sensor positions. In this paper, we first study an MI-based monitoring network in shallow sea, then focus on how to design an optimal node deployment strategy and a clustering algorithm to prolong network lifetime for a 3D-UWSN by reducing the network energy consumption. Using the Voronoi diagram, we propose a high-energy node priority clustering algorithm, in which a cluster head would be selected according to the remaining energy of sensor nodes and the geometry distance among them. Moreover, in order to improve the efficiency of data collection, we use the ant colony optimization to find the shortest path for autonomous underwater vehicle. The simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms other conventional protocols in some certain scenarios.

ID SIDESCAN; CLASSIFICATION; FEATURES
AB Identifying fixed bed roughness scales of hydrodynamic relevance to waves and currents is challenging around coral reefs due to their highly inhomogeneous bathymetry. In order to characterize the spatial variability in reef roughness, a quantitative analysis of high-resolution sidescan sonar backscatter is performed for the identification of distinct substrates around a tropical reef and is related to echo sounder-based roughness measurements. Data were collected in the vicinity of the Kilo Nalu Observatory on the south shore of Oahu using sidescan sonar and a narrow beam echo sounder incorporated in a REMUS-100 (Remote Environmental Monitoring UnitS) autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). With basic statistics and principal component analysis of variables derived from the backscatter data, it is possible to discriminate between areas of rough reef, bare reef, and rippled sand. Echo sounder-derived spectral analysis did not reveal dominant length scales. However, by combining the seabed classification obtained from sidescan measurements with echo sounder data, spectral root mean square (RMS) height values of approximately 3.3 cm and 7.3 cm are assigned to the bare reef and rough reef areas, respectively, for roughness with wavelengths between 0.2 and 6 m.

AB While bringing convenience to people, the growing number of vehicles already on roads causes inevitable traffic congestion. Traffic congestion can happen for both observable reasons, such as accidents, or occur naturally due to human driving style in high vehicles density scenarios. In the latter case, traffic congestion are referred to as phantom jams. To alleviate the traffic instability caused by phantom jams, bilateral control models have been proposed with the development of intelligent transportation system (ITS) in ideal situations. However, in road scenarios, some factors that severely affect the performance of existing models cannot be ignored, such as uncertainties of vehicle state measurements caused by on-board sensors, time delay caused by intervehicle communications and control systems of vehicles. In this paper, a novel predictable bilateral control model (PBCM) with local wireless communication, which consists of best estimation and state prediction, is proposed to accurately control the host vehicle in traffic flow to alleviate traffic instability. Compared with other models, theoretical analysis and simulation results show that more accurate control decisions could be obtained with the PBCM, which could distribute all vehicles more evenly, and our model could maintain higher velocities when disturbances occurred. The experimental results also reveal that our proposed model could more effectively suppress traffic instability (i.e., the improvement in control decision a is more than 10%) and could restore traffic balance 20% faster than other models on average.

AB The development of battery electric (BE) heavy-duty trucks (HDTs) is highly limited to the short cycling life of batteries. In this paper, we propose a battery aging-conscious control strategy for extended battery life by optimizing the speed trajectory of BE HDT. A state-space model is constructed by connecting the vehicle dynamics and battery state of charge, and a mechanism-based aging model of battery is then introduced to formulate the optimization problem for minimal battery aging and energy consumption. The optimization problem is solved within a model predictive control framework for the real-time speed control of the vehicle A non-cooperative platooning controller is further developed for the vehicle in adaptation to the traffic, where the intervehicular distance is controlled for reducing the air drag coefficient so that both the energy consumption and battery aging are improved. Simulation results show that for the single-vehicle controller, the battery degradation and energy consumption are, respectively, reduced by up to 25.7% and 3.2% compared with the cruise control strategy. Based on the non-cooperative controller, the HDT is able to follow preceding vehicles with different parameters with battery aging and energy consumption further, respectively, reduced by 2%-5% and 9%-10% compared with those of the single-vehicle controller.

AB Marine animals have been the bio-inspirational source for some novel concepts for locomotion, sensing, and the intelligent control of undersea vehicles. There has been little (if any) research in the area of bio-inspired energy utilization strategies applied to undersea vehicles. For example, there are reasons why some fish swim at a specific cruise speed; why some fish move by burst acceleration to higher speeds followed by coasting; and why some negatively buoyant fish alternately glide downwards, and then swim upward. The goal of this study is td develop the theory and models of the climb and glide form of autonomous undersea vehicle transit in a form that can permit assessment of future practical technology insertions (such as drag reduction and wing design). In addition, existing theory was expanded to address vehicles with significant wet weight and the effect of hotel load (equivalent to the basal metabolic rate of animals). Several observations from this preliminary analysis for climb/ glide operation of practical vehicles were made. Over a practical and useful range of hotel loads and net vehicle lift-to-drag ratios, energy savings benefits relative to level flight transit from 10% to excess of 40% can be expected. This translates directly into a 10-40% increase in range if a climb/glide strategy is employed instead of level flight transit under the right operating conditions.

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

ID TRAFFIC-FLOW; AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; MODEL
AB Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) vehicle string operations have the potential to improve significantly the mobility and energy consumption performance of congested freeway corridors. This study examines the impact of CACC string operations on vehicle speed and fuel economy on the 13-mi SR-99 corridor, near Sacramento, CA. It extends the existing body of knowledge by performing a multi-scenario simulation analysis of the freeway corridor. A simulation study evaluated the performance of the corridor under various CACC market penetration scenarios and traffic demand inputs. The CACC string operation was also analyzed when vehicle awareness device (VAD) and CACC managed lane (ML) strategies were implemented. The case study revealed that the average vehicle speed increased by 70% when the CACC market penetration increased from 0% to 100%. The highest average fuel economy, expressed in miles per gallon (mpg), was achieved under the 50% CACC scenario where mpg was 27. This was 10% higher than the baseline scenario. However, when the CACC market penetration was 50% or higher, the vehicle fuel efficiency only had minor increases. When CACC market penetration reached 100%, the corridor allowed 30% more traffic to enter the network without experiencing reduced average speed. Results also indicate that the VAD strategy increased the speed by 8% when the CACC market penetration was 20% or 40%, while there was a minor decrease in mpg. The ML strategy decreased the corridor performance when implemented alone.

ID ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
AB Vehicle platoons (VPs) are groups of vehicles driving together with a short inter-vehicle gap and a harmonized velocity. For a long period, the VPs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) will coexist in mixed traffic flow, where the cut-in maneuver of the HDVs towards the VPs can be frequently expected. In this paper, to handle such cut-ins, we propose an intention prediction-based control method for the VPs by considering the tradeoff between the platoon integrity and traffic safety. Particularly, the proposed method is designed to prevent as many cut-ins as possible while taking care of the road safety. It consists of a cut-in prediction part, including intention and trajectory prediction algorithms, and a finite state machine (FSM)-based predictive control part, including a high-level FSM and a low-level predictive control. Driver-in-the-loop experiments were conducted in the VP-based driving scenarios to train the intention prediction algorithm and test the proposed method. We show the results detailing the control behavior of the proposed method in a no cut-in test, a mandatory cut-in test, and three discretionary cut-in tests. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can predict the cut-in intention of human drivers in real time. Besides, according to the prediction results, the proposed method can prevent cut-ins for the VPs while taking care of the road safety.

AB In this paper, the potential effects of automated driving that are relevant to policy and society are explored, findings discussed in literature about those effects are reviewed and areas for future research are identified. The structure of our review is based on the ripple effect concept, which represents the implications of automated vehicles at three different stages: first-order (traffic, travel cost, and travel choices), second-order (vehicle ownership and sharing, location choices and land use, and transport infrastructure), and third-order (energy consumption, air pollution, safety, social equity, economy, and public health). Our review shows that first-order impacts on road capacity, fuel efficiency, emissions, and accidents risk are expected to be beneficial. The magnitude of these benefits will likely increase with the level of automation and cooperation and with the penetration rate of these systems. The synergistic effects between vehicle automation, sharing, and electrification can multiply these benefits. However, studies confirm that automated vehicles can induce additional travel demand because of more and longer vehicle trips. Potential land use changes have not been included in these estimations about excessive travel demand. Other third-order benefits on safety, economy, public health and social equity still remain unclear. Therefore, the balance between the short-term benefits and long-term impacts of vehicle automation remains an open question.

AB This paper presents a modular autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platform called the Multi-robot System (MRS) Drone that can be used in a large range of indoor and outdoor applications. The MRS Drone features unique modularity changes in actuators, frames, and sensory configuration. As the name suggests, the platform is specially tailored for deployment within a MRS group. The MRS Drone contributes to the state-of-the-art of UAV platforms by allowing smooth real-world deployment of multiple aerial robots, as well as by outperforming other platforms with its modularity. For real-world multi-robot deployment in various applications, the platform is easy to both assemble and modify. Moreover, it is accompanied by a realistic simulator to enable safe pre-flight testing and a smooth transition to complex real-world experiments. In this manuscript, we present mechanical and electrical designs, software architecture, and technical specifications to build a fully autonomous multi UAV system. Finally, we demonstrate the full capabilities and the unique modularity of the MRS Drone in various real-world applications that required a diverse range of platform configurations.

AB A mathematical model for the target tracking problem is proposed. The model makes it possible to describe conditions when the time for an observer to receive the results of indirect observations of a moving object depends not only on the state of the observation environment but also on the state of the object itself. The source of such a model is the observation process, by stationary means, of an autonomous underwater vehicle, in which the time for obtaining up-to-date data depends on the unknown distance between the object and the observer. As part of the study of the problem, the equations of the optimal Bayesian filter are obtained. But this filter is not possible to implement. For practical purposes, it is proposed to use the conditionally minimax nonlinear filter, which has shown promising results in other complex tracking models. The conditions for the filter's evaluation and its accuracy characteristics are given. A large-scale numerical experiment illustrating the filter's operation and the observation system's features with random delays are described.

AB Conflict prediction is a vital component of path planning for autonomous vehicles. Prediction methods must be accurate for reliable navigation, but also computationally efficient to enable online path planning. Efficient prediction methods are especially crucial when testing large sets of candidate trajectories. We present a prediction method that has the same accuracy as existing methods, but up to an order of magnitude faster. This is achieved by rewriting the conflict prediction problem in terms of the first-passage time distribution using a dimension-reduction transform. First-passage time distributions are analytically derived for a subset of Gaussian processes describing vehicle motion. The proposed method is applicable to 2-D stochastic processes where the mean can be approximated by line segments, and the conflict boundary can be approximated by piece-wise straight lines. The proposed method was tested in simulation and compared to two probability flow methods, as well as a recent instantaneous conflict probability method. The results demonstrate a significant decrease of computation time. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fault-tolerant control of actuator faults in over-actuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) during trajectory tracking has involved problems. First, the fault-tolerant control method of controlling typical rudder faults, including lost, jammed, and/or deformed rudders, is introduced to reconstruct the control input , a complete scheme of self-diagnosis , fault-tolerant control is proposed based on a sliding mode observer (SMO). Secondly, an efficient nonlinear saturation constraint sequential quadratic programming (SC-SQP) algorithm is proposed to solve the control allocation problem of multi-constraint quadratic programming, in particular with the motion in the initial or kinetic cycle transition stages. Considering the time-varying and unknown disturbances that occur in oceans, the control moments are compensated by the SMO to resist the perturbation of the hydrodynamic coefficient. Finally, the simulations show that the SC-SQP algorithm is efficient and can be used to solve the typical rudder faults with perturbation of the hydrodynamic coefficient during the fault-tolerant trajectory tracking control for over-actuated AUVs.

AB Left turning at unsignalized intersectionis one of the most challenging tasks for urban automated driving, due to the various shapes of intersections and rapidly changing nature of the driving scenarios. This article addresses the challenges of decision making at highly uncertain intersections of different shapes by proposing a generalized critical turning point (CTP)-based hierarchical decision-making and planning method. The high-level planner takes the road map information and generates CTPs using a parameterized extraction model that is proposed and verified by naturalistic driving data. The CTPs are used to generate behavior-oriented paths that could be adapted to various intersections. These modifications help to assure high searching efficiency of the planning process. The low-level planner makes real-time, 2-D planning using a partially observable Markov decision process solver, which can handle the uncertainties of the intersections and make less conservative yet safe actions. With proper modifications, our proposed method can make commute-efficient 2-D planning decisions at unsignalized intersections of various shapes in real time.

AB Autonomous systems with nonlinear dynamics need to be extremely resilient to errors in sensors, actuators and on-board electronics for the purpose of overall vehicle safety. Prior research has focused on control-theoretic methods with significant computational burden with a focus on failures in actuation. In contrast, we propose the use of hierarchical machine learning driven state space checks that detect and diagnose errors in control program execution, sensors and actuators with high sensitivity and low latency. Each check produces a time-varying error signal that facilitates effect-cause diagnosis of the system, while allowing rapid parameter estimation from each check. Since the checks are over small subsets of system parameters, estimation is fast and accurate. The estimated parameters are then used to reconfigure the system controller parameters for rapid system recovery. We use a quadcopter system to demonstrate and validate our approach. Controller, sensor and actuator errors can be detected, diagnosed and compensated using a common checking platform with low computational overhead. The technique is validated on a quadcopter hardware test vehicle.

AB This paper is concerned with the human-machine shared control issue for vehicle lane keeping systems via a new fuzzy observer-based event-triggered method. In order to capture system nonlinear and uncertain characteristics such as nonlinear tire dynamics, varying velocity and driver behavioral uncertainties, Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy approach is employed to model the global driver-vehicle-road system. After system modeling, the fuzzy observer-based control structure is considered because a full states information is not available in practical driving environment. Then, most existing human-machine shared control methods are based on the periodic sampling communication mechanism. However, since the network bandwidth is limited, the above mechanism may cause oversampling and communication congestion. Thus, an adaptive event-triggered mechanism is introduced between the observer and the controller to mitigate the communication burden and improve the bandwidth utilization. Based on Lyapunov functional theory, a set of sufficient conditions are given to calculate desired human-machine shared controllers. Finally, simulation tests are implemented on Matlab/Simulink-CarSim platform and simulation results illustrate that the proposed method can achieve a favorable improvement in the lane keeping capability, the driver handling comfort and the network bandwidth utilization.

AB Localization of the vehicle with respect to road lanes plays a critical role in the advances of making the vehicle fully autonomous. Vision based road lane line detection provides a feasible and low cost solution as the vehicle pose can be derived from the detection. While good progress has been made, the road lane line detection has remained an open one, given challenging road appearances with shadows, varying lighting conditions, worn-out lane lines etc. In this paper, we propose a more robust vision-based approach with respect to these challenges. The approach incorporates four key steps. Lane line pixels are first pooled with a ridge detector. An effective noise filtering mechanism will next remove noise pixels to a large extent. A modified version of sequential RANdom Sample Consensus) is then adopted in a model fitting procedure to ensure each lane line in the image is captured correctly. Finally, if lane lines on both sides of the road exist, a parallelism reinforcement technique is imposed to improve the model accuracy. The results obtained show that the proposed approach is able to detect the lane lines accurately and at a high success rate compared to current approaches. The model derived from the lane line detection is capable of generating precise and consistent vehicle localization information with respect to road lane lines, including road geometry, vehicle position and orientation.

AB This article presents a mathematical model for real-time platoon recognition using the connected vehicle (CV) technology. Platoon information is a crucial part of traffic signal coordination and is difficult to obtain with traditional technologies such as loop detectors. The past work on platoon recognition using CV is very limited and lacked verification on the applicable range or evaluation of the performance of algorithms. The proposed algorithm is focused on estimating platoon characteristics for signal coordination and adaptive signal control with CV's vehicle-to-vehicle communication and an onboard GPS device. First, the detected platoon is identified by a modified critical time-headway. Then, platoon size and starting and ending times are estimated. Lastly, the filtering process for "qualified" detected platoon is proposed to optimize detectability. The results show that the proposed algorithm can estimate well in various traffic conditions and under both fixed-time and actuated signal control without the need for recalibration. Furthermore, two analytical models to estimate the detection rate are proposed and shown to be close to the numerical results and can be used to estimate the required market penetration ratio for the application without field experiments or microscopic simulation. The accuracy of both the recognition algorithm and detection rate estimation is obtained without relying on inputs that are hard to obtain in practice. Accordingly, the proposed algorithm can be an important part of adaptive signal control focusing on real-time coordination in CV environment.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE
AB A methodology for optimizing the inertial characteristics, propeller, battery capacity and PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) controller for propeller of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is proposed in this paper. The AUV is launched at high speed in horizontal orientation, thereafter it pitches bow down and finally hovers at a particular desired water depth. The study involves both positively and negatively buoyant AUV. Four quadrant propeller open water model and quaternion are incorporated in the Maneuvering Modeling Group (MMG) type maneuvering model to make it suitable for 7 degree of freedom (DoF) dynamics. The bow down orientation is performed due to the inertial characteristics of the AUV, while the depth control maneuvering of the AUV is carried out by using PID controller for propeller revolutions. A cost function is proposed in terms of energy consumed and the distance traveled by AUV during the desired maneuver. The numeral value of cost function can be computed by carrying out numerical simulations. The numerical simulations can estimate when the AUV's propeller works in turbine mode. This information is useful for protecting the electric/electronic components of the AUV.

TI 3D Object Detection Based on Proposal Generation Network Utilizing
   Monocular Images
SO IEEE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Monocular 3-D object detection is a low-cost and challenging task for autonomous vehicles and robotics. Utilizing a monocular image for 3-D object detection is served as an auxiliary module for autonomous vehicles and is a growing concern recently. Currently, the expensive lidar and stereo cameras have a predominant performance on accurate 3-D object detection, whereas monocular-based methods are considerably lower in performance. This performance gap is minimized by reforming the monocular-based method as a single internal network. We exploit the correlation between 2-D and 3-D detection spaces, enabling 3-D boxes to leverage feature maps generated in image space. The 2-D and 3-D proposals are extracted through a proposal generation network that is enhanced and utilized for estimating accurate 3-D detection and localization. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that in comparison to other monocular object detection methods the proposed method considerably improved the accuracy of 3-D object detection. The mean average precision of 3-D object detection in front view is improved to 25% and the bird's eye view to 32% for the car class on a moderate difficulty level.

AB Localization is one of the most critical tasks for an autonomous vehicle, as position information is required to understand its surroundings and move accordingly. Visual Odometry (VO) has shown promising results in the last years. However, VO algorithms are usually evaluated in outdoor street scenarios and do not consider underground railway scenarios, with low lighting conditions in tunnels and significant lighting changes between tunnels and railway platforms. Besides, there is a lack of GPS, and it is not easy to access such infrastructures. This research proposes a method to create a ground truth of images and poses in underground railway scenarios. Second, the EnlightenGAN algorithm is proposed to face challenging lighting conditions, which can be coupled with any state-of-the-art VO techniques. Finally, the obtained ground truth and the EnlightenGAN have been tested in a real scenario. Two different VO approaches have been used: ORB-SLAM2 and DF-VO. The results show that the EnlightenGAN enhancement improves the performance of both approaches.

AB Development of control algorithms for enhancing performance in safety-critical systems such as the Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) system is an important issue in the emerging field of automated electric vehicles. In this study, we model a safety distance-based hierarchical AEB control system constituted of a high-level Rule-Based Supervisory control module, an intermediate-level switching algorithm and a low-level control module. The Rule Based supervisor determines the required deceleration command that is fed to the low-level control module via the switching algorithm. In the low-level, two wheel slip control algorithms were developed, a Robust Sliding Mode control algorithm with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for nonlinear parameter estimation and a Gain-Scheduled Linear Quadratic Regulator. For the needs of this control design, a non-linear dynamic vehicle model was implemented whereas a constant tireroad friction coefficient was considered. The proposed control system was validated in Simulink, assuming a straight-line braking maneuver on a flat dry road. The simulation results demonstrated satisfactory emergency braking performance with full collision avoidance in both proposed control system combinations.

TI Real-time Image Contrast Enhancement VLSI Design for Intelligent

SO JOURNAL OF IMAGING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB A novel hardware-oriented image contrast enhancement algorithm is proposed in this study for intelligent autonomous vehicles. It utilizes a weighted filter and calculates the brightness values of an image based on the adjusted image. The brightness values are processed to either reduce or increase the brightness values of the points. To further improve the quality of an image, the algorithm implements a block-based pixel processing as opposed to a per image frame processing. The brightness values for each block or area in the image are used to improve the contrast of the image. This is accomplished by reducing or increasing the different brightness values of the pixel or lifting point in each block. Simulation results showed that compared with previously proposed algorithms, this work improved on the average discrete entropy by 1% and increased the average color enhancement factor by 8.5%. The proposed novel algorithm was realized using TSMC 0.18 mu m CMOS cell process. The VLSI design has a total gate count of 6028 and operates with a frequency of 201 MHz and a power rating of 17.47 mW. (C) 2020 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.

AB The multiple depot ring-star problem (MDRSP) is an important combinatorial optimization problem that arises in optical fiber network design and in applications that collect data using stationary sensing devices and autonomous vehicles. Given the locations of a set of customers and a set of depots, the goal is to (i) find a set of simple cycles such that each cycle (ring) passes through a subset of customers and exactly one depot, (ii) assign each non-visited customer to a visited customer or a depot, and (iii) minimize the sum of the routing costs, i.e., the cost of the cycles and the assignment costs. We present a mixed integer linear programming formulation for the MDRSP and propose valid inequalities to strengthen the linear programming relaxation. Furthermore, we present a polyhedral analysis and derive facet-inducing results for the MDRSP. All these results are then used to develop a branch-and-cut algorithm to obtain optimal solutions to the MDRSP. The performance of the branch-and-cut algorithm is evaluated through extensive computational experiments on several classes of test instances.

AB This study analyses an Adaptive Trajectory Control (ATC) system in case of a sudden change in mu(max) (maximum tyre-road friction coefficient) during an emergency lane change manoeuvre in order to maintain the driving safety. Autonomous front wheel steering (FWS) systems have been developed for emergency steering situations. The trajectory design is also a part of these systems. Moreover, in this study ATC has been designed by sensing mu(max) to complete the emergency steering manoeuvre successfully. Therefore, the originality of this paper arises from the necessity of a trajectory change in case of a sudden change in mu(max) to minimize the distance between the desired and the actual path. Suitable cases were designed by using a two-track model in IPG/CarMaker (MATLAB/Simulink). Results show that ATC could be used during an emergency steering manoeuvre in case of a sudden decrease in mu(max) as it can be advantageous in certain critical traffic situations. Therefore, ATC could be used as an alternative system instead of Electronic Stability Program.

AB In the water jet propulsion system of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), the nozzle is an important energy conversion component to generate reaction thrust, which consists of momentum thrust and pressure thrust. This paper presents a numerical investigation into four different nozzles (cos, exponent, cylindrical and conical ones) for the water jet propulsion system of AUVs. The effects of geometric parameters (length L and wall roughness K-s) and dynamic parameter (backpressure with constant pressure difference) of four different nozzles on the momentum thrust, average fluid velocity and vapor mass flow rate are analyzed. The governing equations are solved through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software Fluent 14.0. The results show that cos nozzle which produces more momentum thrust is the most appropriate, and the nozzle length L is proposed to set 36 mm. The effects of wall roughness Ks are different on four nozzles, and the smooth inner wall is proposed for cos nozzles. This study provides instructional principles for the design of nozzle in water jet propulsion system of AUVs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we propose and develop a small-scale research platform for intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). Our platform has four main parts, i.e., an arena, an indoor localization system, automated radio-controlled (RC) cars, and roadside monitoring facilities. First, to mimic traffic environments, we build an arena with a wooden floor, mock buildings, and streets. Second, to facilitate feedback control for trajectory following, an indoor localization system is set up to track the RC cars. Third, both autonomous driving RC cars and human driving RC cars are developed, based on an automated RC car design. The automated RC cars can receive control signals from a computer through an Xbee RF module and control the front and rear wheels through motors. A new control algorithm is developed to allow the RC cars to track predefined trajectories. Finally, we implement an example of roadside monitoring, which uses a fish-eye camera associated with advanced video processing for image segmentation, object identification, and tracking. Experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed platform. We also discuss possible ITS research problems that can be studied in this testbed.

AB The last decade has seen an exponential interest in conventional and unconventional energy issues. This trend has also extended to road transport issues and is driven by expectations to minimize fuel and/or energy consumption and negative environmental impact. In the global literature, much attention is focused on the work of autonomous transport, both passenger and trucks, and on the phenomena of platooning. The paper presents original aerodynamic and aeroacoustic tests of heterogeneous vehicle columns. In the work, models of a car, a van and a truck were built, followed by heterogeneous columns with different distances between the vehicles. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods and two turbulence models, k - omega shear stress transport (SST) and large eddy simulation (LES), were used in this study. The study enabled the determination of drag coefficients and lift force. Application of the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FW-H) analogy allowed for the determination of the distributions of sound pressure levels generated by moving vehicles and columns of vehicles. In order to verify the developed models, acoustic field measurements were made for the following passages: passenger car, van, and truck. Acoustic pressure level and A-weighted sound level (SPL) were measured in Krakow and in its vicinity. Research has shown that grouping vehicles into optimal columns and maintaining distances between vehicles using modern control systems can result in significant energy savings and reduce harmful emissions to the environment.

AB Vehicles are being equipped with more and more smart devices, which help the driver in his tasks. Alongside the trend to more and more autonomous vehicles emerges the possibility of making vehicles that move together as a platoon, which can be defined as a spatio-temporal organization of a set of vehicles based on a specific predetermined geometrical configuration. Basically, there are two main approaches for performing platoon control and these depend on the reference frame used (local or global). Even if the literature about platoon control is abundant, the most commonly used metrics are only tied to the stability of the platoon, that is, to the lateral and longitudinal distances between vehicles. However, these metrics are sufficient enough for a first evaluation of one algorithm; a deeper evaluation of a platoon control solution requires more well-defined metrics and perturbations that allow for the testing of algorithms with various parametrized conditions. The goal of this article is to present definitions of metrics, perturbations, spatial configurations, and scenarios that are aimed at helping scientists in the field to determine strong and precise evaluations of their platoon control algorithms. The work presented in this article stems directly from thinking performed during the institutional projects in which the authors have been involved and also takes inspiration from numerous articles on the subject and experiments made both in simulation and with real vehicles.

AB To build an over-actuated vehicle, the chosen equipment is composed of an active four-wheel drive and steering systems, a torque vectoring system, and an active braking system. In general, the goal of the over-actuated vehicle is to improve stability and handling performance for both conventional and autonomous vehicles. This paper presents an active geometry control suspension system (AGVS), based on a 3-DOF parallel mechanism, which is capable of acting simultaneously on the camber, the rear-wheel steering and the body roll angles. The aim of this study is to analyse the performance and feasibility of this active suspension mechanism when assembled in a C-class vehicle. These analyses were developed through a co-simulation scheme implemented in CarSim and Simulink software for three different manoeuvres: steady-state cornering, fishhook and double lane change. The performance analysis provides a comparison of the same C-class vehicle equipped with different systems, from the original to the fully actuated one. The conducted simulations reveal how superior a multi-purpose control system is when compared to the other single-actuated systems, and how it can manage the necessary trade-off among the selected metrics, namely, the roll gradient, the understeer gradient, the yaw rate, the body roll angle, and the lateral acceleration. In the feasibility analysis of AVGS the demanded actuator power and force in typical manoeuvres was assessed. In addition, the required ranges for the camber and rear-wheel steering actuations, as well as for the mechanism joints, were determined. The vehicle equipped with AGVS demonstrates improvements of dynamic behaviour in both steady-state and transient manoeuvres.

AB Pedestrian detection plays an essential role in the navigation system of autonomous vehicles. Multisensor fusion-based approaches are usually used to improve detection performance. In this study, we aimed to develop a score fusion-based pedestrian detection algorithm by integrating the data of two light detection and ranging systems (LiDARs). We first evaluated a two-stage object-detection pipeline for each LiDAR, including object proposal and fine classification. The scores from these two different classifiers were then fused to generate the result using the Bayesian rule. To improve proposal performance, we applied two features: the central points density feature, which acts as a filter to speed up the process and reduce false alarms; and the location feature, including the density distribution and height difference distribution of the point cloud, which describes an object's profile and location in a sliding window. Extensive experiments tested in KITTI and the self-built dataset show that our method could produce highly accurate pedestrian detection results in real-time. The proposed method not only considers the accuracy and efficiency but also the flexibility for different modalities.

AB Despite the increasing use of sensor technologies in border surveillance applications, there is a lack of systematic methodology and its implementation with the effective control system. The challenge arises due to information heterogeneity and uncertainty caused by the usage of different sensors. This paper extends the authors' previous dynamic-data-driven adaptive multi-level simulation (DDDAMS) framework to overcome this challenge using unmanned vehicles (UVs), sensors, and multi-level simulation. Specifically, the detection and classification algorithms are employed to process real-time data generated by fixed (e.g. geophone) and mobile (e.g. UV camera) sensors for the adequate monitoring. Also, physics-based simulation (PBS) is utilized to provide uncertainties for robust planning and control of UVs. The environmental effects as well as target's proactive behavior against the surveillance system are incorporated into the framework using utility-based decision-making model. Finally, we provide a detailed description regarding field demonstration, where autonomous control of UVs and real-time communications among all system components are attained through PBS.

AB This paper presents the development, evaluation, calibration, and field application of a novel, relatively inexpensive, vision-based sensor system employing commercially available off-the-shelf devices, for enabling the autonomous data acquisition of road surface conditions. Detailed evaluations and enhancements of a variety of technical approaches and algorithms for overcoming vision-based measurement distortions induced by the motion of the monitoring platform were conducted. It is shown that the proposed multi-sensor system, by capitalizing on powerful data-fusion approaches of the type developed in this paper, can provide a robust cost-effective road surface monitoring system with sufficient accuracy to satisfy typical maintenance needs, in regard to the detection, localization, and quantification of potholes and similar qualitative deterioration features where the measurements are acquired via a vehicle moving at normal speeds on typical city streets. The proposed system is ideal to be used for crowdsourcing where several vehicles would be equipped with this cost-effective system for more frequent data collection of road surfaces. Suggestions for future research needs to enhance the capabilities of the proposed system are included.

AB Planning an autonomous vehicle's (AV) path in a space shared with pedestrians requires reasoning about pedestrians' future trajectories. A practical pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithm for the use of AVs needs to consider the effect of the vehicle's interactions with the pedestrians on pedestrians' future motion behaviours. In this regard, this paper systematically reviews different methods proposed in the literature for modelling pedestrian trajectory prediction in presence of vehicles that can be applied for unstructured environments. This paper also investigates specific considerations for pedestrian-vehicle interaction (compared with pedestrian-pedestrian interaction) and reviews how different variables such as prediction uncertainties and behavioural differences are accounted for in the previously proposed prediction models. PRISMA guidelines were followed. Articles that did not consider vehicle and pedestrian interactions or actual trajectories, and articles that only focused on road crossing were excluded. A total of 1260 unique peer-reviewed articles from ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus databases were identified in the search. 64 articles were included in the final review as they met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. An overview of datasets containing trajectory data of both pedestrians and vehicles used by the reviewed papers has been provided. Research gaps and directions for future work, such as having more effective definition of interacting agents in deep learning methods and the need for gathering more datasets of mixed traffic in unstructured environments are discussed.

AB During the automatic driving of a vehicle, the vehicle's positional information is important for vehicle driving control. If fixed-point land markers such as magnetic markers are used, the vehicle's current position error can be calculated only when a marker is detected while driving, and this error can be used to correct the estimation position. Therefore, correction information is used irregularly and intermittently according to the installation intervals of the magnetic markers and the driving speed. If the detected errors are corrected all at once using the position correction method, discontinuity of the position information can occur. This problem causes instability in the vehicle's route guidance control because the position error fluctuates as the vehicle's speed increases. We devised a time-division position correction method that calculates the error using the absolute position of the magnetic marker, which is estimated when the magnetic marker is detected, along with the absolute position information from the magnetic marker database. Instead of correcting the error at once when the position and heading errors are corrected, the correction is performed by dividing the errors multiple times until the next magnetic marker is detected. This prevents sudden discontinuity of the vehicle position information, and the calculated correction amount is used without loss to obtain stable and continuous position information. We conducted driving tests to compare the performances of the proposed algorithm and conventional methods. We compared the continuity of the position information and the mean error and confirmed the superiority of the proposed method in terms of these aspects.

AB Future car purchase can determine an array of things ranging from CO2 emissions to urban life quality. For this reason, models and methods predicting car purchase are valuable to policy makers. This paper examines the future car purchase choice, using modules and different levels of attributes that construct a car, and measures the effect on the purchase choice of personality traits such as symbolic/exuberant attitudes towards vehicles. The results may enable policy makers to focus on certain market segments when promoting alternative fuel and automated vehicles. The paper proposes a hybrid choice model, with latent variables capturing the pro-environmental, exuberant and tech-friendly attitudes of individuals. The questionnaire presented to the respondents is in the form of a menu, from which participants may choose five different types of vehicle characteristics (engine size, type of car, fuel type, car edition and level of automation) to construct their ideal vehicle. Results indicate a negative correlation between symbolic, exuberant attitudes towards automobiles, the view of cars as symbols, and willingness to purchase a hybrid or electric vehicle. The findings further suggest that there is a correlation between symbol-driven exuberant attitudes and the desire to buy a larger vehicle. This paper examines the relationship between the symbolic perception of cars and, simultaneously, a range of characteristics, to discover which car attributes the symbolic perception affects. It also proposes an integrated framework for the modeling of future car purchase, with the hypothesis that each of the three presented latent variables can affect different modules of the individual's ideal car concept.

AB Communication among road users smooths interactions, improves efficiency, and mitigates risk. Eye contact and waving may be the most salient of this communication, but more often road users use their movement or position as implicit signals. Vehicle automation may disrupt these signals by introducing unfamiliar or unclear interactions that may not align with other road user expectations. This creates a need to evaluate how effectively vehicle automation communicates and how this affects safety and efficiency. Vehicle automation with effective communication can enter the roadway ecology more naturally and facilitate acceptance across society. We modeled the outcomes of vehicle-pedestrian encounters where drivers yielded for pedestrians. Models of the initial conditions revealed that drivers and pedestrians jointly contribute to safety and efficiency; however, the initial conditions were generally poor predictors, suggesting that dynamic interaction may be an important determinant of those outcomes. An interdependence model of wait times revealed that driver and pedestrian influence on one another varied across traffic control devices. During the nonintersection encounters, pedestrian wait time depended on their own speed and distance when entering the encounter, indicating that they may linger away from the road and choose the encounter conditions. The stop sign encounters showed a division of influence, with pedestrian and driver initial conditions influencing their own wait time. The unprotected encounters showed negotiation, with pedestrian initial conditions influencing the driver wait time. We demonstrate the need and methods to understand interdependence between road users and the implications for vehicle automation communication.

AB This paper presents real-time obstacles detection and their status classification method for collision warning in the vehicle active safety system. Specifically, stereo cameras and millimeter wave (mmw)-radar are fused to help the driving ego-vehicle to find "Danger" or "Potential Danger" in a timely way through combining with the vehicle kinematic model. The proposed method makes full use of the unique advantages of stereo cameras and mmw-radar to sense the environment through several modules. Cameras are mainly used to detect the near or lateral dynamic objects and to obtain the obstacles region of interest (ROI) considering its rich information and high sensitivity to the lateral displacement, while far or longitudinal relative dynamic objects are detected by mmw-radar according to its observational ability to make up for the disadvantage of cameras. In detail, a cameras detector utilizes "error vectors" rather than the optical flow to obtain dynamic classes through two times clustering. Mmw-radar mainly detects relative dynamic objects, whose absolute speed can be computed according to the ego-vehicle's state. Then, the detected objects of these two detectors are integrated in an obstacles ROI map, which is obtained through an UV-disparity obstacles detection algorithm to get the final dynamic and relative dynamic objects. Finally, they are classified by comparing them with a dangerous area that is acquired according to the vehicle kinematic model in a special vehicle coordinate system, which is fixed to the ground temporarily. This method is tested on our mobile platforms and the results prove that it can work effectively even though the ego-vehicle drives quickly.

AB Adaptive cruise control (ACC) system, as one of the most fundamental modules of automated vehicles, is widely used in commercially available vehicles. It inevitably influences the traffic flow, from both the individual perspective, that is, its interaction with other traffic participants, and the traffic system perspective, that is, traffic string stability and road capacity. However, subject to limited data availability, no consistent conclusions on these impacts have been reached in the literature. Meanwhile, the similarities and differences between ACC vehicles and human-driven vehicles (HDV) have not been fully discussed and comparisons among different commercially available ACC systems remain to be untangled. Therefore, to fill this gap, this study investigates the car-following characteristics of various ACC systems and compares them with human drivers based on the open-access OpenACC database. We first identify the proper surrogate car-following model for denoting the driving behaviors of ACC vehicles and HDVs from five widely used car-following models, among which the best-fitted one is the intelligent driver model. Then, we implement the Gaussian mixture model and Jensen-Shannon divergence to describe the similarities between ACC systems and human drivers. Moreover, the string stability of different ACC platoons in various traffic conditions are investigated with a series of simulation experiments. Results show that all the ACC systems are string unstable, and more unstable than human drivers. The behavior of the Ford-ACC system is most similar to human drivers with a relative low instability, while the Peugeot-ACC system behaves most differently to human drivers, and aggressively with the highest instability.

AB Connectivity is a key element enabling intelligent vehicles to communicate with each other and the Smart Road. In general, the connectivity is allowed by an On-Board Unit enabling the Vehicle to Everything communication. This paper proposes an innovative unit acting not only as a device allowing connectivity but also as an intelligent electronic control unit to perform advanced and adaptive control strategies able to give reference trajectories and actuator set-points to the low-level control systems of power-train and vehicle dynamics. In particular, based on a cascade model predictive control, an adaptive control strategy is proposed, considering time-varying parameters and information related to vehicle kinematics and dynamics. Such a strategy allows the vehicle to follow a certain origin-destination path in the inertial frame, based on an upper controller that considers a vehicle kinematic model so as to give speed references and target values for the steering angle at the wheels to the inner predictive control loop acting on both longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics. To check the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a comparison is made with existing cascade control strategies. The results show better safety and lane-keeping performance. Then, using Hardware-In-the-Loop testing for the proposed Intelligent On-Board Unit, the considered approach demonstrates robustness against parametric variations, signal delay and noise both in the Global Positioning System and in the yaw rate sensor. The achieved results show good robustness properties, safety performances and confirm the real-time execution of the cascade control strategy, paving the way to future developments necessary before tests in a real road scenario.

ID MODEL
AB As a core function of autonomous driving (AD) and the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), accurately predicting the trajectory of vehicles can significantly improve traffic safety and reduce crash injuries. In this article, we propose an intention-aware non-autoregressive Transformer model with multi-attention learning for multimodal vehicle trajectory prediction. We first present social attention learning (SAL) where graph attention is properly integrated with the Transformer encoder so as to model the social interaction between vehicles. Then, the social and temporal dependency across consecutive frames is captured by temporal attention learning (TAL). The above social and temporal attention modules can be interleaved and stacked to achieve the coupled modeling and thus extract abundant features from trajectory data. To implement precise prediction as well as efficient inference, we further put forward an intention-aware decoder query generation approach to produce multiple possible trajectories concurrently. Finally, cross-attention learning (CAL) is devised to make full use of the encoded features, therefore, yielding future predictions. The proposed model is evaluated on two large-scale vehicle trajectory datasets and the experimental results verify that our algorithm achieves better performance compared with some state-of-the-art models. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the predicted trajectory over 5-s time horizon for the next generation simulation (NGSIM) and HighD datasets is 3.43 and 1.10 m, respectively.

   Cooperative Localization
SO IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS

DE Localization; multi-robot SLAM
ID KALMAN FILTER; ICP
AB Cooperative localization is still an open problem for autonomous vehicle driving tasks. Generally, there are two essential issues to be handled for multi-vehicle cooperative localization: one is how to use extra information shared by neighbour vehicles to augment ego-vehicle localization; the other is how to handle data sources of various error types used for state estimation, such as nonlinearity, dynamic noises, and correlation which may exist simultaneously. Previous works usually evaluate performance under one of the issues at one time, or they do not perform well under some extreme situations with both of the two types of problems. This paper presents an accurate and robust cooperative localization system with a decentralized framework, which not only takes advantages of inter vehicle relative pose estimation via shared information, but also ensures the performance under data sources of various error types simultaneously. We adopt a state-of-the-art point cloud registration method to obtain the cooperative relative pose estimation using shared information. In addition, we use the adaptive cubature split covariance intersection filter (ACSCIF) to estimate the vehicle state. This algorithm can approximate nonlinearity and deal with dynamic measurement noise by a third-order term using cubature transformation and innovation-based adaptive estimation (IAE) theory, also considering correlations among estimated sources inevitably exists in the decentralized mechanism. Finally, a comparative study based on the CARLA simulation platform demonstrates the potential and advantage of the proposed multi-vehicle cooperative localization system using ACSCIF in terms of accuracy, robustness and efficiency.

AB The robustness of deep neural networks is an increasingly essential issue as they become more and more prevalent in several real-world applications like autonomous vehicles. If traffic signs turn to adversarial examples, an autonomous vehicle will probably be misled and cause fatal accidents. To improve adversarial robustness, a new cost function for training convolutional neural recognition networks is proposed in this paper. Recent works proved that by employing the classifier probabilities on the complement (incorrect) classes as well as the ground-truth class in Softmax Cross Entropy, the model achieves better performance on adversarial inputs. In this paper, we show that in addition to using the information from Softmax layer, the extracted features from convolutional layers also enhance the robustness. In our new cost function, Regularized Guided Complement Entropy (RGCE), by decreasing the output of convolutional layers' activation functions alongside utilizing Softmax layer output in training phase, we reach better model performance on adversarial attacks. Our proposed algorithm is evaluated on CIFAR-10 and GTSRB datasets. The performances of different convolutional neural networks on clean and adversarial images are reported and compared with other methods.

AB Path planning is particularly important for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the marine environments. Due to the existence of flow fields, many conventional path planning methods are not effective. As the flow distributions vary slowly in large spatial scales, this paper considers the influence of static non-uniform vector field and studies the time-optimal path planning of AUV. The method proposed in this paper is called GK-OPM (Graph and K-means based Optimization Method). GK-OPM generates initial paths for minimum-time path optimization using digraph and K-means method, which benefit optimality and efficiency, respectively. To discuss the parameters in GK-OPM and compare the performance with genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), Monte Carlo simulation is carried out under the ocean currents simulated by the Lamb-vertex function. The feasibility is verified on discrete ocean data and three-dimensional environments, too. The results show that GK-OPM has about 6-8 times better efficiency than GA and PSO and maintains optimality at the same time.

DT Article
ID DIAGNOSIS
AB To deal with thrusters' faults of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), an iterative learning algorithm fault-tolerant control (FTC) based on the linear extended states observer (LESO) is proposed. In this control scheme, the non-linear feedback mechanism of the LESO is transplanted into iterative learning processes to estimate fault. Compared to our previous work, LESO is used to substitute classic non-linear extended state observer to make the establishment of the whole system more structured; moreover, the number of parameters need to be tuned can be reduced by the conception of observer bandwidth of LESO. To enhance the controllability and robustness of whole scheme, a new saturated sliding mode controller is proposed based on the Lyapunov theory. Then to achieve online parameter self-tuning for the control system, fuzzy logic controllers are introduced to find optimal relationship between LESO's parameter and tracking errors. The performance of the proposed controller is tested by some comparison experiments on Zhuhai A18D AUV; the results show that the proposed control scheme can ensure better stability than classical control and our previous control scheme when AUV suffers faults.

Far from business-as-usual, we explain how Big Tech is reshaping the traditional automotive industry by making the car "platform ready," as imposed on the web before it. The article considers how this novel transformation of automobility is increasingly significant for critical scholars of social media, platforms, and platformization, as bespoke forms of mediated, datafied, and platformized, sociality emerge. Specifically, we identify six levels upon which this platformization of automobility is unfolding and through which Big Tech is reorganizing the automotive industry according to platform logics concerning programmability, modularity, connectivity, data collection, and developmental partnerships. We do so by analyzing academic and technical literature, industry reports, and initiatives with a stake in platform automobility. Finally, we suggest directions for further research into Big Tech's stake in the future of automobility, as these new dynamics begin to reshape the automotive industry at large.

AB Autonomous exploration requires robots to generate informative trajectories iteratively. Although sampling-based methods are highly efficient in unmanned aerial vehicle exploration, many of these methods do not effectively utilize the sampled information from the previous planning iterations, leading to redundant computation and longer exploration time. Also, few have explicitly shown their exploration ability in dynamic environments even though they can run real-time. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel dynamic exploration planner (DEP) for exploring unknown environments using incremental sampling and Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM). In our sampling strategy, nodes are added incrementally and distributed evenly in the explored region, yielding the best viewpoints. To further shortening exploration time and ensuring safety, our planner optimizes paths locally and refine them based on the Euclidean Signed Distance Function (ESDF) map. Meanwhile, as the multi-query planner, PRM allows the proposed planner to quickly search alternative paths to avoid dynamic obstacles for safe exploration. Simulation experiments show that our method safely explores dynamic environments and outperforms the benchmark planners in terms of exploration time, path length, and computational time.

AB This paper focuses on planning a three-dimensional (3-D) path for the autonomous underwater vehicle in ocean environment with complicated static and dynamic obstacles as well as the ocean current. Imitating the principle of natural flow avoiding rocks, we develop a submerged path planning method based on improved interfered fluid dynamical system (IIFDS). In view of the particular feature of ocean environment, the obstacles and ocean current are modeled first. The flow field weight coefficient is then proposed to add the current into the confluence of IIFDS, so that the planned path could make use of the current. In order to obtain the energy-optimal path, the improved genetic algorithm whose mutation operator is modified by grey wolf optimizer is proposed to optimize the repulsive and tangential reaction coefficient, tangential direction coefficient, and flow field weight coefficient. Furthermore, a reverse-avoidance strategy is applied to real-time path planning to avoid dynamic obstacles, combined with IIFDS. Finally, the good performance of our proposed method is verified by simulations in various scenarios.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE STORAGE
AB The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of two material handling systems (MHSs) - autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RSs) and traditional, crane-based, automated storage and retrieval systems (CBAS/RSs) - with respect to key performance measures. First, the two MHSs are simulated using ARENA 12.0, commercial software, via 198 experiments based on the rack configurations of the warehouses, number of storage and retrieval (S/R) devices and S/R transaction rates. Five performance measures are considered - average flow time, S/R device utilisation, average waiting time in S/R device queue, average number of jobs waiting in S/R device queue and cost. We also complete a paired-t test comparison to find out the best warehouse design based on cost, flow time and utilisation of the S/R devices. An examination of the results, specifically the flow time of the S/R devices, suggests that in many cases the AVS/RS performs better than the CBAS/RS. However, the best design, when the system costs are considered, is obtained with a CBAS/RS.

AB Vibration-control techniques generally fall into two categories: passive methods that optimize the structure of the suspension to absorb any impact from the ground, and active methods that directly control the vertical force of the suspension by hydraulic or electric actuators when the vehicle traverses a bumpy road. In this study, a vibration-control method is described that employs both an optimal controller and suspension parameter optimization. Continuous speed bumps are implemented to simulate more complex and realistic driving conditions. First, a vehicle system is modeled using a semi-recursive multibody formulation, which allows for a more precise description of the longitudinal-vertical dynamics. Then, an optimal control method for vehicle vibration control is introduced. Second, the Latin hypercube design is utilized to analyze the response surface methodology (RSM) model. For suspension optimization, the RSM model and the non-linear programming with a quadratic Lagrangian (NLPQL) algorithm are employed. Thirdly, both passive suspension optimization and active motion control are employed for vibration control. The results indicate that the presented method can effectively control vehicle vibration, decreasing the average vibration by 30.8%. The results suggest that the novel approach can also enhance the ride comfort in autonomous vehicles traversing, e.g., a series of speed bumps.

AB Data sharing is essential for future autonomous vehicles in vehicular networks. Building trust in the shared data can be challenging among mutually unknown vehicles in an open and distributed environment. Blockchain is the key to establish trusted data sharing in a decentralized vehicular environment. However, the low efficiency (e.g., transaction per second, TPS) of blockchain is the bottleneck for the efficient data sharing. Moreover, the highly dynamic topology, the imperfect wireless links, and the limited radio coverage may further slow down the blockchain consensus process. To improve the efficiency and trustworthiness of data sharing in a vehicular network, we propose a sharding-enabled vehicular blockchain system. Specifically, the blockchain-enabled vehicles are dynamically allocated to different shards based on their geographical locations so that transactions are processed in parallel. We design an efficient and trusted sharding-enabled blockchain consensus mechanism by integrating a reputation-assisted intra-shard consensus and a vehicle-assisted inter-shard consensus. The reputation assistance in intra-shard consensus is designed to defend against the collusive false-block attack that may happen in a small-scale shard environment. The vehicle-assisted inter-shard consensus is designed to tackle the issues caused by defective roadside units (RSUs). Simulation results demonstrate the improved performance on efficiency and trustwor-thiness of the proposed system. In addition, trusted data sharing can be established even under the conditions of malicious vehicles or attacked RSUs.

AB With the development of technologies in recent decades and the imposition of international standards to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, car manufacturers have turned their attention to new technologies related to electric/hybrid vehicles and electric fuel cell vehicles. This paper focuses on electric fuel cell vehicles, which optimally combine the fuel cell system with hybrid energy storage systems, represented by batteries and ultracapacitors, to meet the dynamic power demand required by the electric motor and auxiliary systems. This paper compares the latest proposed topologies for fuel cell electric vehicles and reveals the new technologies and DC/DC converters involved to generate up-to-date information for researchers and developers interested in this specialized field. From a software point of view, the latest energy management strategies are analyzed and compared with the reference strategies, taking into account performance indicators such as energy efficiency, hydrogen consumption and degradation of the subsystems involved, which is the main challenge for car developers. The advantages and disadvantages of three types of strategies (rule-based strategies, optimization-based strategies and learning-based strategies) are discussed. Thus, future software developers can focus on new control algorithms in the area of artificial intelligence developed to meet the challenges posed by new technologies for autonomous vehicles.

AB In order to enable emerging vehicular Internet of Things (IoT) applications, including fully autonomous driving, more efforts should be done in collecting driving experiences in different road situations. This requires the exchange of information between vehicles as each vehicle has very limited experience. Due to the decentralized feature of vehicular environment, an efficient management of collaborative behaviors among the vehicles becomes particularly important. Blockchain has been attracting great interest recently because it provides a way to reach consensus in decentralized systems. However, existing blockchain systems assume high communication capabilities for vehicles, which is difficult to achieve in a decentralized vehicular environment. Existing studies also assume the existence of networking infrastructure, such as roadside units (RSU). In this paper, we propose a scheme to empower blockchain in vehicular environments without depending on the existing networking infrastructure. The proposed scheme uses a distributed clustering approach to select some vehicles as edge nodes, and the edge nodes maintain the blockchain used to record transactions in a decentralized way. The proposed scheme employs a distributed approach that guides vehicle clustering with the consideration of multiple metrics based on a fuzzy logic algorithm. By using the edge nodes, the proposed scheme solves the communication problem of maintaining a blockchain in a totally decentralized vehicular environment. We use computer simulations to clarify the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of communication performance by comparing it with existing baselines.

AB This paper proposed a unified model including yaw and roll dynamics for any axle or articulation configuration of buses by using a reconfigurable approach. First, all the possible existing configurations of buses are introduced, including the axle/articulation configuration, powertrain configuration, and active chassis control configuration. Consequently, the research is motivated by a key question: how can we develop a unified model that is inclusive and configurable to all of the above bus configurations? To develop the model, three layers of the modeling process are presented step by step. The magic formula and vertical load transfer are discussed to formulate the tyre model. It is noted that the case of the articulated bus is presented in an independent section but how it is included and unified in a general form is also explained. Finally, a modeling validation of axle or articulation configuration cases is performed and the comparative results to high-fidelity models show the feasibility, efficiency, and convenience of the reconfigurable approach. As the crucial feature, the resulting model can be potentially applied to model-based controller design in any buses without reformulating the model. This will greatly benefit the vehicle dynamics control and also future autonomous buses. Although the focus of this paper is buses, the proposed approach actually covers any multi-axle/articulated vehicles, like trucks, tractor-trailers.

AB Autonomous route following with road vehicles has gained popularity in the last few decades. In order to provide highly automated driver assistance systems, different types and combinations of sensors have been presented in the literature. However, most of these approaches apply quite sophisticated and expensive sensors, and hence, the development of a cost-efficient solution still remains a challenging problem. This work proposes the use of a single monocular camera sensor for an automatic steering control, speed assistance for the driver and localization of the vehicle on a road. Herein, we assume that the vehicle is mainly traveling along a predefined path, such as in public transport. A computer vision approach is presented to detect a line painted on the road, which defines the path to follow. Visual markers with a special design painted on the road provide information to localize the vehicle and to assist in its speed control. Furthermore, a vision-based control system, which keeps the vehicle on the predefined path under inner-city speed constraints, is also presented. Real driving tests with a commercial car on a closed circuit finally prove the applicability of the derived approach. In these tests, the car reached a maximum speed of 48 km/h and successfully traveled a distance of 7 km without the intervention of a human driver and any interruption.

AB This study presents a fuel-economical driving strategy for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and investigates its impacts on human-driven platoon's fuel efficiency, considering driver behavioral diversity. In mixed traffic where a limited number of CAVs and many human-driven vehicles share the road, the Eco-Driving strategy of CAVs, accomplished through vehicle connectivity and longitudinal dynamics control, can significantly reduce fuel consumption of CAVs, particularly during transient traffic conditions, by avoiding unnecessary braking and acceleration maneuvers which lead to excessive fuel consumption. This is implemented and Validated by a vehicle longitudinal dynamic control design with an instantaneous power-based fuel rate estimation model. Moreover, such an Eco-Driving strategy will also help most of the following human-driven vehicles to improve fuel performance despite a highly diverse and uncertain driving characteristics spectrum. The car-following behaviors of a human-driven platoon are described by a microscopic traffic model with dedicated representations of the individual drivers' preferences. A comprehensive statistical investigation shows the fuel-saving benefits for a human-driven platoon by adopting the proposed Eco-Driving strategy for CAVs. Some special cases are discussed, as well. The results collectively demonstrate the positive impacts of CAVs, even with a low penetration rate, could potentially have on the energy efficiency of the transportation sector within the foreseeable future.

AB Event-based communication strategies for vehicles navigating by aiding their inertial navigation systems (INSs) with terrestrial signals of opportunity (SOPs) are developed. The following problem is considered. Multiple navigating vehicles with access to global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals are aiding their on-board INSs with GNSS pseudoranges. While navigating, vehicle-mounted receivers draw pseudorange measurements from terrestrial SOPs with unknown emitter positions and unknown and unsynchronized clocks. The vehicles share INS data and SOP pseudoranges to collaboratively estimate the SOPs' states through an extended Kalman filter (EKF). After some time, GNSS signals become unavailable, at which point the navigating vehicles use shared INS and SOP information to continue navigating in a collaborative inertial radio simultaneous localization and mapping (CIRSLAM) framework. Two event-based communication strategies to share this information are developed, where instead of sharing information at a fixed-rate when measurements become available, information is only shared whenever any vehicle's position error could violate a user-specified position error threshold with some desired probability. Simulation results are presented demonstrating the tradeoff between localization performance and the accumulated transmitted data when the event-based transmission scheme is employed versus sharing data at the fixed-rate. Experimental results are presented demonstrating two unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) navigating in a CIRSLAM framework with SOP pseudoranges drawn from terrestrial cellular towers. The event-based communication scheme reduced the cumulative communicated data by 86.6% compared to a fixed-rate scheme, while maintaining the specified error constraint.

AB This study investigated the operational impact of heavy commercial vehicle (HCV) platooning on urban arterials. HCV platooning is an important application of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) technology, with urban arterials facilitating an essential component of HCV movements when picking up and delivering goods. HCV platooning has the potential to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. Moreover, the increasing HCV driver shortage problem can be alleviated if the vehicle following behind a lead vehicle can function without a driver by using autonomous technology enabling Society of Automotive Engineers Level 4 or higher. PTV VISSIM was used to develop a set of micro-simulation models that investigated the impact of traffic signal priority (TSP) and low levels (0%, 5%, and 10%) of HCV platooning. The performance measures include travel time and the number of stops. With the existing traffic control system, HCV platooning increased travel time and increased the number of stops for all vehicles including passenger cars and HCVs. TSP with 5% HCV platooning improved travel time and decreased the number of stops for all vehicles. TSP with 10% HCV platooning, however, only decreased travel time and the number of stops for passenger vehicles. The results suggest that a higher penetration rate of HCV platooning may create significant delays and overwhelm the traffic system even with the assistance of TSP. The findings of this study highlight the potential for TSP to mitigate the impact of HCV platooning on traffic congestion. However, the TSP system may not be a panacea that works for all traffic compositions.

AB The accurate sensor localization is one of the most basic requirements for the Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs) in many applications. However, in harsh underwater environment, the existence of propagation speed variation with depth (i.e., stratification effect) and asynchronous clock generally affects the ranging estimation, and in turn significantly decreases localization accuracy. Taking into account these specific characteristics of UASNs, we first propose an efficient Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) aided joint localization and time synchronization solution for UASNs, subjected to stratification effect constraint, in which AUV acts as a mobile anchor and broadcasts beacon signals periodically to provide localization reference for unknown target sensors. Next, since the estimation accuracy of localization and synchronization is very sensitive to the accuracy of the AUV locations, the joint localization and synchronization method in the case of inaccurate AVU locations is considered. Then, Cramer Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) analyses are presented for both accurate and inaccurate AVU locations cases. Finally, numerical simulation results show that the proposed method in this paper outperforms the existing ones in terms of estimation errors.

AB This article proposes a new method for estimating the extrinsic calibration parameters between any pair of multibeam LiDAR sensors on a vehicle. Unlike many state-of-the-art works, this method does not use any calibration pattern or reflective marks placed in the environment to perform the calibration; in addition, the sensors do not need to have overlapping fields of view. An iterative closest point (ICP)-based process is used to determine the values of the calibration parameters, resulting in better convergence and improved accuracy. Furthermore, a setup based on the car learning to act (CARLA) simulator is introduced to evaluate the approach, enabling quantitative assessment with ground-truth data. The results show an accuracy comparable with other approaches that require more complex procedures and have a more restricted range of applicable setups. This work also provides qualitative results on a real setup, where the alignment between the different point clouds can be visually checked. The open-source code is available at https://github.com/midemig/pcd_calib.

TI Multi-Camera 3D Object Detection for Autonomous Driving Using Deep

AB In the absence of depth-centric sensors, 3D object detection using only conventional cameras becomes ill-posed and inaccurate due to the lack of depth information in the RGB image. We propose a multi-camera perception solution to predict the 3D properties of the vehicle obtained from the aggregated information from multiple static infrastructure-installed cameras. While a multi-bin regression loss has been adopted to predict the orientation of a 3D bounding box using a convolutional neural network, combining it with the geometrical constraints of a 2D bounding box to form a 3D bounding box is not accurate enough for all the driving scenarios and orientations. This paper leverages a vision transformer that overcomes the drawbacks of convolutional neural networks when there are no external LiDAR or pseudo-LiDAR pre-trained datasets available for depth map estimation, particularly in occluded regions. By combining the predicted 3D boxes from various cameras using an average weighted score algorithm, we determine the best bounding box with the highest confidence score. Comprehensive simulations for performance analysis are shown from the results obtained by utilizing the KITTI standard data generated from the CARLA simulator.

AB The controller area network (CAN) is the most widely used intra-vehicular communication network in the automotive industry. Because of its simplicity in design, it lacks most of the requirements needed for a security-proven communication protocol. However, a safe and secured environment is imperative for autonomous as well as connected vehicles. Therefore CAN security is considered one of the important topics in the automotive research community. In this article, we propose a four-stage intrusion detection system that uses the chi-squared method and can detect any kind of strong and weak cyber attacks in a CAN. This work is the first-ever graph-based defense system proposed for the CAN. Our experimental results show that we have a very low 5.26% misclassification for denial of service (DoS) attack, 10% misclassification for fuzzy attack, 4.76% misclassification for replay attack, and no misclassification for spoofing attack. In addition, the proposed methodology exhibits up to 13.73% better accuracy compared to existing ID sequence-based methods.

AB This article addresses the problem of autonomous servoing control of an unmanned aerial manipulator with the capability of grasping target objects using computer vision. Specifically, a practical visual servo control using a spherical projection model is proposed. The aerial manipulator is an unmanned aerial vehicle equipped with a robotic arm that greatly increases the freedom and operational flexibility of the end-effector. However, it also increases the complexity of the kinematics, dynamics, and control design of the complete system. A novel passivity-like error equation of the image features is established by using the spherical camera geometry dynamics with an eye-in-hand configuration. To further improve the grasping performance, a task-priority control scheme is utilized with one main task and several subtasks, i.e., controlling the gripper position and orientation, vertically aligning the center of gravity, and avoiding the joint limitation. Simulation results are provided to illustrate and assess the performance of the proposed visual servo control. The practicability and effectiveness of autonomous aerial manipulation are well supported by the experimental results acquired through outdoor environments.

AB The drastic price reduction in variable renewable energy, such as wind and solar, coupled with the ease of use of smart technologies at the consumer level, is driving dramatic changes to the power system that will significantly transform how power is made, delivered, and used. Distributed energy resources (DERs)-which can include solar photovoltaic (PV), fuel cells, microturbines, gensets, distributed energy storage (e.g., batteries and ice storage), and new loads [e.g., electric vehicles (EVs), LED lighting, smart appliances, and electric heat pumps]-are being added to electric grids and causing bidirectional power flows and voltage fluctuations that can impact optimal control and system operation. Residential solar installations are expected to increase approximately 8% annually through 2050. Customer battery systems are anticipated to reach almost 1.9 GW by 2024, and current forecasts project that approximately 18.7 million EVs will be on U.S. roads in 2030. With numbers like these, it is not unreasonable to imagine a residential electricity customer having at least five controllable DERs. In future

AB In this work, the authors propose a novel decentralised coordination scheme for autonomous ground vehicles to enable map building and path planning with a network of smart overhead cameras. Decentralised indoor smart camera mapping and hierarchical navigation supports the automatic generation of waypoint graphs for each camera in an environment and allows path planning through the environment across multiple camera fields of view, or subviews. The proposed solution utilises the growing neural gas algorithm to learn the topology of unoccupied working space in each subview for maintaining a dynamic waypoint graph on each camera. The authors' pathing solution leverages a modified version of the A* algorithm to compute paths in a decentralised and hierarchical fashion. Waypoint generation was simulated and analysed on a generated environment to ensure it is both effective and efficient, while path planning was simulated on various randomised hierarchical graphs to effectively compare the proposed Decentralised-A* (D-A*) algorithm against standard greedy search. The proposed method efficiently handles the cases where other robot navigation methods are otherwise weak and ineffective, while still providing avenues for further optimisation of resource overhead for both the smart camera network as well as the robots themselves.

AB This Paper discusses energy harvesting from atmospheric phenomena for small unmanned aerial vehicles, theoretically through simulations and practically through experimental flights. A comparison between different scenarios for flight within the sinusoidal wind profile is presented. A significant improvement in performance with active control of command surfaces has been found for an energy-harvesting mode when compared to autostabilization or fixed-stick flight. Moreover, a detailed decomposition of the stochastic wind profile generated from the Kaimal spectrum has shown which frequencies and magnitudes of wind time series have the highest contribution to the energy-transfer process. It is found that wind profiles with higher turbulence intensity potentially provide more energy for transfer to the aircraft. Furthermore, the Paper reveals a biologically inspired sensory system for wind field estimation. It describes the necessary equipment and control algorithms for the exploitation of atmospheric energy. Initial flight tests were performed to determine the average power consumption of the motor for altitude hold tasks and to evaluate the performance of sensors. Moreover, additional flights for autonomous exploitation of several atmospheric phenomena are presented and analyzed.

DE traffic sign; detection; real time
AB Traffic sign detection is one of the key components in autonomous driving. Advanced autonomous vehicles armed with high quality sensors capture high definition images for further analysis. Detecting traffic signs, moving vehicles, and lanes is important for localization and decision making. Traffic signs, especially those that are far from the camera, are small, and so are challenging to traditional object detection methods. In this work, in order to reduce computational cost and improve detection performance, we split the large input images into small blocks and then recognize traffic signs in the blocks using another detection module. Therefore, this paper proposes a three-stage traffic sign detector, which connects a BlockNet with an RPN-RCNN detection network. BlockNet, which is composed of a set of CNN layers, is capable of performing block-level foreground detection, making inferences in less than 1 ms. Then, the RPN-RCNN two-stage detector is used to identify traffic sign objects in each block; it is trained on a derived dataset named TT100KPatch. Experiments show that our framework can achieve both state-of-the-art accuracy and recall; its fastest detection speed is 102 fps.

AB This work considers a general fully coupled autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for applying nonlinear suboptimal control. In most cases, AUV models are nonlinear and affine in control, especially without modeling rudders and fins. The aim of this work is to address the challenges of nonlinear non-affine AUVs for implementing the controllers, as this aspect of control design has received little attention in this field of research. The NPS Ills a well-known AUV that is often mentioned in research on nonlinear, non-affine modeling. This model is considered for applying the state-dependent Riccati equation (SDRE) controller with a non-affine structure for point-to-point motion that generates a suboptimal path. Furthermore, the control, design and simulation results are provided without any simplification or decoupling of the entire system. The design approach of this paper is implemented on NPS II; nonetheless, this point of view can be actualized on any AUV using the same technique. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes novel cooperative navigation solutions for an Intervention Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (I-AUV) working in tandem with an Autonomous Surface Craft (ASC). The I-AUV is assumed to be moving in the presence of constant unknown ocean currents, and aims to estimate its position relying on measurements of its range to the ASC. Two different scenarios are considered: in the first scenario, the ASC transmits its position and velocity to the I-AUV, and the I-AUV has access to readings of its velocity relative to the water. In the second scenario, the ASC transmits only its position, and the I-AUV has access to measurements of its velocity relative to the ASC. In both cases, it is assumed that an Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) mounted on-board the I-AUV provides measurements of its attitude and angular velocity. A sufficient condition for observability and a method for designing state observers with Globally Asymptotically Stable (GAS) error dynamics are presented for both problems. Finally, simulation results are included and discussed to assess the performance of the proposed solutions in the presence of measurement noise.

AB This paper reports on various aspects of the Intelligent Vehicle Systems (IVS) team's involvement in the recent 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge, wherein our platform, the autonomous "XAV-250," competed as one of the 11 finalists qualifying for the event. We provide a candid discussion of the hardware and software design process that led to our team's entry, along with lessons learned at this event and derived from participation in the two previous Grand Challenges. In addition, we give an overview of our vision-, radar-, and LIDAR-based perceptual sensing suite, its fusion with a military-grade inertial navigation package, and the map-based control and planning architectures used leading up to and during the event. The underlying theme of this article is to elucidate how the development of future automotive safety systems can potentially be accelerated by tackling the technological challenges of autonomous ground vehicle robotics. Of interest, we will discuss how a production manufacturing mindset imposes a unique set of constraints upon approaching the problem and how this worked for and against us, given the very compressed timeline of the contests.

AB The development of new assessment methods for the performance of automated vehicles is essential to enable the deployment of automated driving technologies, due to the complex operational domain of automated vehicles. One contributing method is scenario-based assessment in which test cases are derived from real-world road traffic scenarios obtained from driving data. Given the complexity of the reality that is being modeled in these scenarios, it is a challenge to define a structure for capturing these scenarios. An intensional definition that provides a set of characteristics that are deemed to be both necessary and sufficient to qualify as a scenario assures that the scenarios constructed are both complete and intercomparable. In this article, we develop a comprehensive and operable definition of the notion of scenario while considering existing definitions in the literature. This is achieved by proposing an object-oriented framework in which scenarios and their building blocks are defined as classes of objects having attributes, methods, and relationships with other objects. The object-oriented approach promotes clarity, modularity, reusability, and encapsulation of the objects. We provide definitions and justifications of each of the terms. Furthermore, the framework is used to translate the terms in a coding language that is publicly available.

AB This paper presents a "cooperative vehicle sorting" strategy that seeks to optimally sort connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in a multi-lane platoon to reach an ideally organized platoon. In the proposed method, a CAV platoon is firstly discretized into a grid system, where a CAV moves from one cell to another in discrete time-space domain. Then, the cooperative sorting problem is modeled as a path-finding problem in the graphic domain. The problem is solved by the deterministic A* algorithm with a stepwise strategy, where only one vehicle can move within a movement step. The resultant shortest path is further optimized with an integer linear programming algorithm to minimize the sorting time by allowing multiple movements within a step. To improve the algorithm running time and address multiple shortest paths, a distributed stochastic A* algorithm (DSA*) is developed by introducing random disturbances to the edge costs to break uniform paths (with equal path cost). Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DSA* method. The results report shorter sorting time and significantly improved algorithm running time due to the use of DSA*. In addition, we find that the optimization performance can be further improved by increasing the number of processes in the distributed computing system.

AB The rise of the intelligent transportation system (ITS) brings golden opportunity to accelerate the development of environment-friendly smart mobility eco-system. The intelligent control of connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) platoon with V2V communication as the core technology exhibits superior energy-saving potential. However, there still exist plentiful technologies of the emerging vehicle platoon need to be improved. Hence, this paper describes a predictive optimization strategy as ecological cooperative adaptive cruise control (eCACC) based on nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to minimize the energy consumption of an electrified CAV platoon considering V2V topological communication structure of leader predecessor follower. The cost function for NMPC includes the following velocity, range deviation and energy consumption. Through the simulation analysis under various drive cycles, the advantage of the proposed scheme emerges that the platoon consisted of three vehicles possesses the nice string stability, excellent following performance and significant energy-saving potential at same time. Moreover, the acceleration of the following vehicles is in a small range, improving the drive comfort. By the comparison with the existed Eco ACC controller, the simulation results demonstrate the proposed controller owns better following performance and energy-saving behavior of 16.1%, 6.2% and 11.7% under full UDDS, HWFET and NEDC drive cycle, respectively.

AB Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) systems can significantly improve traffic safety and roadway capacity utilizing short following gaps of vehicles enabled by inter-vehicle communications. However, due to merging processes occurring at freeway merging areas, existing CACC operation approaches are generally not applicable and the operation will have to revert back to Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) or human-driven mode, which in turn will result in a capacity drop. This paper proposes an optimal trajectory optimization strategy for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) to cooperatively carry out mainline platooning and on-ramp merging. Firstly, a control framework of the CACC is adopted for a longitudinal control of CAVs, which helps individual CAVs to join platoons and to maintain platoon operations. Secondly, to ensure smooth lane-changing executions while achieving stable platoons, an optimal controller that considers lane-changing motivation of merging vehicles and impact of merging on platoons, is proposed. Third, a Legendre pseudo-spectral algorithm is applied to transform the controller into a simpler nonlinear programming problem and to efficiently solve it. Simulation assessments of the proposed method are conducted at both individual vehicle level and traffic-flow level. At the individual vehicle level, the proposed method has the potential to improve the traffic safety without compromising fuel consumption and emissions compared with unoptimized feasible schemes. At a traffic-flow level, an online evaluation platform is implemented, and a typical freeway on-ramp area is studied. The simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed controller provides significant improvements in terms of efficiencies in traffic operations.

AB The emerging intelligent connected technology provides conditions for obtaining the trajectory of vehicles. To reduce the adverse effects of stop-and-go vehicles in the bottleneck section of expressways, a strategy of coordinated speed control based on trajectory is proposed in a single-lane. Firstly, the trajectories of the connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) in the downstream vehicle cluster are offset and modified to predict the trajectory of the last human vehicle (HV) based on the information collected by the road side traffic sensors and combined with the speed of traffic wave and the driver's reaction time. Then, according to the predicted trajectory, the velocity distribution of the first CAV in the vehicle cluster upstream at different time points is planned to restrain the propagation of velocity oscillation, the CAV can gradually merge into the downstream traffic flow at a more reasonable and smooth speed. Finally, the influence of different factors on the suppression of speed oscillation are analyzed by numerical simulation. The results show that: within the numerical simulation range of the designed CAV permeability of 0%similar to 25% and the starting position of the bottleneck is 575 m similar to 975 m, the higher the permeability, the farther the starting position of the bottleneck and the smoother the speed curve selected by CAV, the stronger the suppression of speed oscillations, and at the same time it proves that the strategy of coordinated speed control can effectively reduce the fluctuation of traffic flow, improve driver comfort and overall efficiency of vehicle queue.

AB This paper presents a stochastic and predictive control design approach for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in a mixed-autonomy traffic environment, where CAVs are able to react properly to uncertain maneuvers of human-driven vehicles (HVs). The proposed fully-automated cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) design leverages a discrete hybrid stochastic model predictive controller that automatically determines the vehicle's operating mode based on onboard sensors data and information received through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. Operating modes include free following, warning, danger, emergency braking, and lane change. Although the controller mainly focuses on maintaining the desired velocity and distance among CAVs, it also allows HVs to perform lane-change maneuvers and merge into the platoon's lane when needed. In response to an HV's position in the lane and its probabilistic behavior, the controller may switch the CAV's operating mode to react accordingly. Considering free-following and emergency-braking modes leads to efficient and safe autonomous driving. Switching between warning, danger, and lane-change modes along with adjusting the steering angle to perform a lane-change maneuver, when needed, robustifies the platoon's performance against unexpected human-driven vehicle maneuvers. Simulation studies are conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed control design approach. The performance of the proposed control design approach is also compared to a switching control using simulation studies.

AB When planning the path of a non-urbanized road, the default ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm does not consider complex road state function such as uneven surface, road attachment coefficient, and vehicle turning angle limit. Based on the actual situation of roads and vehicles, a pavement state function that considers uneven areas such as road bumps and pavement attachment is proposed to improve the description of path length. Then, a heuristic function based on the A* algorithm and an improved mechanism for the initialization of pheromone distribution is proposed, which changes the blindness of ant colony search, accelerates the convergence of the ACO, and improves the search efficiency. The global search capability of the algorithm is enhanced by improving the path selection strategy and path transition probability function. The pheromone updating method is improved by using the MAX-MIN Ant System, which increases the algorithm diversity and avoids local optima. Further, using the pruning algorithm to reduce the number of paths significantly increases the convergence speed. Simulation results show that the improved ACO algorithm has better convergence speed and global search ability. Combining road state processing with vehicle corner processing can effectively improve the safety, adaptability, and reliability of autonomous vehicles. And the global optimal path planning of unmanned vehicles on complex roads can also be realized.

AB The broadcasting services of vehicles in both vehicular networks and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks can be seen as the typical applications of all-to-all (A2A) scenario. In order to achieve efficient information broadcasting in A2A scenarios, this study proposes a two-stage resource allocation scheme. In the first stage, to improve the frequency spectrum reusability, the communication area is divided into as many non-overlapping square regions as possible based on the reliability requirements and power constraints of the vehicles, where the nonadjacent square regions share the same frequency spectrum. In the second stage, the vehicles belonging to the same region broadcast information with distributed time division multiplexing, and an improved coded slotted ALOHA scheme is proposed based on full-duplex, where each vehicle can detect whether its broadcasted information is successful. Thus, the number of retransmissions and collision probability can be reduced and therefore the system energy can be saved. Results indicate that the two-stage resource allocation scheme significantly improves the resource reusability while guaranteeing the communication reliability.

AB This paper presents a new real-time hierarchical (topological/metric) simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system. It can be applied to the robust localization of a vehicle in large-scale outdoor urban environments, improving the current vehicle navigation systems, most of which are only based on Global Positioning System (GPS). Then, it can be used on autonomous vehicle guidance with recurrent trajectories (bus journeys, theme park internal journeys, etc.). It is exclusively based on the information provided by both a low-cost, wide-angle stereo camera and a low-cost GPS. Our approach divides the whole map into local submaps identified by the so-called fingerprints (vehicle poses). In this submap level (low-level SLAM), a metric approach is carried out. There, a 3-D sequential mapping of visual natural landmarks and the vehicle location/orientation are obtained using a top-down Bayesian method to model the dynamic behavior. GPS measurements are integrated within this low-level improving vehicle positioning. A higher topological level (high-level SLAM) based on fingerprints and the MultiLevel Relaxation (MLR) algorithm has been added to reduce the global error within the map, keeping real-time constraints. This level provides nearly consistent estimation, keeping a small degradation with GPS unavailability. Some experimental results for large-scale outdoor urban environments are presented, showing an almost constant processing time.

DE gaussian process; context-aware target classification; cooperative
   vehicle safety systems; scalable V2X communication
AB Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication has been proposed as a potential solution to improve the robustness and safety of autonomous vehicles by improving coordination and removing the barrier of non-line-of-sight sensing. Cooperative Vehicle Safety (CVS) applications are tightly dependent on the reliability of the underneath data system, which can suffer from loss of information due to the inherent issues of their different components, such as sensors' failures or the poor performance of V2X technologies under dense communication channel load. Particularly, information loss affects the target classification module and, subsequently, the safety application performance. To enable reliable and robust CVS systems that mitigate the effect of information loss, a Context-Aware Target Classification (CA-TC) module coupled with a hybrid learning-based predictive modeling technique for CVS systems is proposed. The CA-TC consists of two modules: a Context-Aware Map (CAM), and a Hybrid Gaussian Process (HGP) prediction system. Consequently, the vehicle safety applications use the information from the CA-TC, making them more robust and reliable. The CAM leverages vehicles' path history, road geometry, tracking, and prediction; and the HGP is utilized to provide accurate vehicles' trajectory predictions to compensate for data loss (due to communication congestion) or sensor measurements' inaccuracies. Based on offline real-world data, a finite bank of driver models that represent the joint dynamics of the vehicle and the drivers' behavior is learned. Offline training and online model updates are combined with on-the-fly forecasting to account for new possible driver behaviors. Finally, the framework is validated using simulation and realistic driving scenarios to confirm its potential in enhancing the robustness and reliability of CVS systems.

AB The control of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV) is a complex problem mainly due to the nonlinear dynamics, uncertainty in model parameters, and external disturbances. Adaptive control is a promising solution to address these issues. Nevertheless, its full potential is yet to be realized, especially in underwater vehicle applications, mainly due to the compromise between the transient performance and a smooth control signal. The addition of a new command governor with standard model reference adaptive control (MRAC) named as a command governor adaptive control (CGAC) has been proposed as a promising solution to this trade-off. Nevertheless, the suitability of CGAC in underwater vehicle applications and its performance are yet to be verified. This paper fills this knowledge gap and experimentally validates the suitability and performance of CGAC in underwater vehicle applications. The standard MRAC is used as the baseline for performance comparison. Experimental results showed that CGAC achieves a low frequency control signal through low gain values and improves transient performance through modifications to the command signal. In addition, the ability of CGAC to overcome disturbances such as tether forces, and tolerate faults such as partial thruster failure was confirmed. Another interesting feature observed in these experiments is the ability of CGAC to operate despite the thruster dead zone, which standard MRAC is unable to perform without a dead-zone inverse. Therefore, according to the results CGAC performs better than standard MRAC and thus is a promising solution for future underwater vehicle applications.

AB Vehicle lane changing is one of the most important topics in autonomous driving and is the behavior most likely to cause vehicle accidents. In order to optimize the performance of vehicle lane change by controlling the speed of the vehicle, which makes the lane change safer, more efficient, and more eco-friendly, a causal inference-based speed control framework is proposed in this study. First, variables affecting the lane change efficiency are selected and their treatment effects are obtained by conducting causal effect analysis and causal refutation analysis. Second, the conditional average treatment effect is estimated by taking the safety and eco-friendly requirements into consideration and applying the double machine learning version causal forest model. Finally, a controller is built, and grid search is used to optimize lane change decision-making. By conducting numerical experiments, the average lane change duration decreased by 5.9% and average velocity increased from 7.165 m/s to 7.791 m/s. The results show that the framework has good performance on improving the efficiency and environmental friendliness of a lane change process while ensuring safety. The proposed framework provides a new approach to speed control for discretionary lane-changing behavior. The approach can be well adapted to a vehicle-to-vehicle communication environment and is expected to be applied to vehicle-assisted driving systems in the future.

AB Gyroidal roads are not uncommon on mountainous freeways. In the provision of complex road information such as visual field and slope, some errors between the perceived headway and the real headway information may exist subject to the accuracy of sensors. With the penetration of automated and autonomous vehicles, there is an increasing need for developing a systematic controlling approach to ensure efficient and safe vehicular motion on gyroidal roads. This study contributes to devising a vehicle-to-vehicle communication based feedback control method with such considerations. A modified car-following model considering perceived headway errors on gyroidal roads is presented. The neutral stability curves of the new model are derived according to the classical control method, which verifies the significant impact of the error coefficient, slope information, and perception time on the robustness of the model, and that the effect of the error coefficient and slope information is positive while that of the perception time is negative. Given the importance of electronic throttle angle information for vehicle-to-vehicle communication technology, a cooperative control signal is designed for the scenario when the above stability condition is unsatisfied. The numerical simulation example verifies the effectiveness of the controller in alleviating traffic congestion and improving road traffic efficiency.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The forthcoming of automated driving has led to vehicular heterogeneity, where vehicles with different automation levels, including connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), connected vehicles (CVs), and human-driven vehicles (HVs), coexist in the road traffic. However, the design of current traffic control systems fail to account for the vehicular traffic heterogeneity. In addition, the emerging artificial intelligence (AI) based traffic control strategies require large quantities of computation resources and generate high delay, which cannot meet the fault-intolerance requirement of the traffic control system. Therefore, there is an urgent need for constructing a new traffic control framework to jointly satisfy the fault-intolerance requirement and realize ubiquitous control over the heterogeneous vehicles. Inspired by this, a digital twin (DT) empowered edge AI framework is proposed in this article. The DT's virtualization capability is utilized to enable virtual risk assessment and performance analysis under the fault-intolerant traffic control system. In addition, the DT's offline learning capability helps the edge AI understand the road traffic data more intelligently to perform enforced optimizations and decisions. Then, a three-layer vehicle control paradigm is discussed under the proposed framework. In the first layer, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is utilized to intelligently control the CAV acceleration and lane-changing. In the second layer, indirect CV/HV control can be performed by adjusting the target speed and penetration rate of the DRL-controlled CAVs which are mixed in the traffic flow. In the third layer, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications and variable message signs are utilized to realize the direct control of CVs and HVs. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed control paradigm.

AB With the introduction of concepts such as ubiquitous mapping, mapping-related technologies are gradually applied in autonomous driving and target recognition. There are many problems in vision measurement and remote sensing, such as difficulty in automatic vehicle discrimination, high missing rates under multiple vehicle targets, and sensitivity to the external environment. This paper proposes an improved RES-YOLO detection algorithm to solve these problems and applies it to the automatic detection of vehicle targets. Specifically, this paper improves the detection effect of the traditional YOLO algorithm by selecting optimized feature networks and constructing adaptive loss functions. The BDD100K data set was used for training and verification. Additionally, the optimized YOLO deep learning vehicle detection model is obtained and compared with recent advanced target recognition algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can automatically identify multiple vehicle targets effectively and can significantly reduce missing and false rates, with the local optimal accuracy of up to 95% and the average accuracy above 86% under large data volume detection. The average accuracy of our algorithm is higher than all five other algorithms including the latest SSD and Faster-RCNN. In average accuracy, the RES-YOLO algorithm for small data volume and large data volume is 1.0% and 1.7% higher than the original YOLO. In addition, the training time is shortened by 7.3% compared with the original algorithm. The network is then tested with five types of local measured vehicle data sets and shows satisfactory recognition accuracy under different interference backgrounds. In short, the method in this paper can complete the task of vehicle target detection under different environmental interferences.

AB Vehicle detection is an indispensable part of environmental perception technology for smart cars. Aiming at the issues that conventional vehicle detection can be easily restricted by environmental conditions and cannot have accuracy and real-time performance, this article proposes a front vehicle detection algorithm for smart car based on improved SSD model. Single shot multibox detector (SSD) is one of the current mainstream object detection frameworks based on deep learning. This work first briefly introduces the SSD network model and analyzes and summarizes its problems and shortcomings in vehicle detection. Then, targeted improvements are performed to the SSD network model, including major advancements to the basic structure of the SSD model, the use of weighted mask in network training, and enhancement to the loss function. Finally, vehicle detection experiments are carried out on the basis of the KITTI vision benchmark suite and self-made vehicle dataset to observe the algorithm performance in different complicated environments and weather conditions. The test results based on the KITTI dataset show that the mAP value reaches 92.18%, and the average processing time per frame is 15 ms. Compared with the existing deep learning-based detection methods, the proposed algorithm can obtain accuracy and real-time performance simultaneously. Meanwhile, the algorithm has excellent robustness and environmental adaptability for complicated traffic environments and anti-jamming capabilities for bad weather conditions. These factors are of great significance to ensure the accurate and efficient operation of smart cars in real traffic scenarios and are beneficial to vastly reduce the incidence of traffic accidents and fully protect people's lives and property.

AB The development of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is the key to improve urban mobility safety and efficiency. This paper focuses on the cooperative vehicle management at a signal-free intersection with consideration of vehicle modeling uncertainties and sensor measurement disturbances. The problem is approached by a hierarchical robust control strategy (HRCS) in a decentralized traffic coordination framework where optimal control and tube-based robust model predictive control (RMPC) methods are designed to hierarchically solve the optimal crossing order and the velocity trajectories of a group of CAVs in terms of energy consumption and throughput. To capture the energy consumption of each vehicle, their powertrain system is modeled in line with an electric drive system. With a suitable relaxation and spatial modeling approach, the optimization problems in HRCS can be formulated as convex second-order cone programs (SOCPs), which provide unique and computationally efficient solution. A rigorous proof of the equivalence between the convexified and the original problems is also provided. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of HRCS and reveal the impact of traffic density on the control solution. The study of the Pareto optimal solutions for the energy-time objective shows that a minor reduction in journey time can considerably reduce energy consumption, which emphasizes the necessity of optimizing their trade-off. Finally, the numerical comparisons carried out for different prediction horizons and sampling intervals provide insight into the control design.

AB This study focuses on addressing the the coupling problem of the vertical and horizontal plane of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with an X-rudder. To guarantee the steering performance of the AUV, a depth and course control algorithm based on an L1 adaptive control algorithm (L1AC) is proposed. Firstly, the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is designed on the basis of an AUV vertical and horizontal linear model, and the system has optimal control quality for both of the nominal vertical and horizontal models. Secondly, the nonlinear state predictor, disturbance estimator, and adaptive controller are designed separately, which is used for the compensation of the uncertainty and disturbance of the AUV dynamic. Finally, the rudder angle allocation algorithm is designed to realize the rudder angle command of the cross rudder to the X-rudder. The simulation and experiment results show that the adaptive control algorithm proposed in this paper can effectively control AUV to complete high-performance course and depth control. Based on the experiments, the prospects and shortcomings of the L1AC, LQR and MRAC algorithm in AUV control are compared and analyzed.

AB The myriad applications of artificial intelligence (AI) by the private and public sectors have exploded in the public consciousness in the postpandemic period. However, researchers and businesses have been working on AI technology applications for decades, and in many ways, governments are rushing to catch up. This article presents an argument that the future of AI policy in the United States will be driven in large part by current and future state-level policy experiments. This argument is presented by drawing on scholarship surrounding federalism, regulatory fragmentation, and the effects of fragmentation on business and social equity. The article then presents the case of autonomous vehicle policy in the states to illustrate the degree of current fragmentation and considers the effects of layering new AI policies on top of existing rules surrounding privacy, licensing, and more. Following this consideration of existing research and its application of AI policy, the article presents a research agenda for leveraging state differences to study the effects of AI policy and develop a cohesive framework for governing AI.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has many intelligent optical system, which can collect underwater signal information to make the system decision. One of them is the intelligent vision system, and it can capture the images to analyze. The performance of the particle image segmentation plays an important role in the monitoring of underwater mineral resources. In order to improve the underwater mineral image segmentation performance, some novel segmentation algorithm architectures are proposed. In this paper, an improved mineral image segmentation is proposed based on the modified U-Net. The pyramid upsampling module and residual module are bring into the U-Net model, which are called JPU-Net, JPMU-Net and ResU-Net. These models combined the power of the residual block and the pyramid upsampling in the encoder part and in the decoder part respectively. The proposed models are tested on the Electron Microscopy images (EM) dataset and the underwater mineral image dataset. The experimental results show that JPU-Net has superior performance on the EM dataset, and JPMU-Net has a better segmentation result than existing convolutional neural network on the underwater mineral image dataset.

AB A powerful simulator highly decreases the need for real-world tests when training and evaluating autonomous vehicles. Data-driven simulators flourished with the recent advancement of conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs), providing high-fidelity images. The main challenge is synthesizing photorealistic images while following given constraints. In this work, we propose to improve the quality of generated images by rethinking the discriminator architecture. The focus is on the class of problems where images are generated given semantic inputs, such as scene segmentation maps or human body poses. We build on successful cGAN models to propose a new semantically-aware discriminator that better guides the generator. We aim to learn a shared latent representation that encodes enough information to jointly do semantic segmentation, content reconstruction, along with a coarse-to-fine grained adversarial reasoning. The achieved improvements are generic and simple enough to be applied to any architecture of conditional image synthesis. We demonstrate the strength of our method on the scene, building, and human synthesis tasks across three different datasets. The code is available https://github.com/vita-epfl/SemDisc.

AB The aim of this paper is to measure distances between autonomous underwater vehicles using power LED as light source and photodiode as receiver in unknown light water adsorption conditions. The method is based on the attenuation of the light signal, depending principally on distance and water characteristics. In a previous paper, we proposed the use of a cheap power LED system to support acoustic devices in localization and configuration computation of an underwater robotics swarm. The idea was based on the exchange of light signals of different wavelengths, to reduce the noise, generated by LEDs; the unknown water conditions, affecting the light propagation, required a local measure of the absorption function a(lambda) to obtain the distance between the source and the receiver. To avoid the use of many different wavelength LEDs, we investigated the influence of power and flash duration on the LED spectral emission. Starting from this experience, we are now able to measure distances without the unpractical local measure of the absorption function. In this paper we show as, modifying frequency, we shall be able to measure a(lambda)} and, consequently, the distance d.

AB As modern cities expand and develop, the resultant increase in population density gives rise to the need for smart solutions to cope with the demands applied to the infrastructure of the city. In this paper, we investigate the shortcomings of traffic policing and emergency response handling systems; propose an intelligent, autonomous UAV-enabled solution; and describe the system in a simulated environment. Several scenarios of traffic monitoring and policing system are considered in the simulation: traffic light violations and accident detection, mobile speeding traps and automated notification, congestion detection and traffic rerouting, flagged stolen vehicles/pending arrest warrants and vehicle tracking using UAVs, and autonomous emergency response handling systems. Furthermore, smart city infrastructure enable intelligent handling of emergencies by providing traffic light prioritization for ground emergency response units to reduce delay for patient care, automated physical bollard on routes with congested points due to accidents or hazards, first responder support UAV units-medical supplies UAV, fire fighting UAV to combat or control small fires, and numerous other benefits. Lastly, we present the results of the simulated system and discuss our findings.

TI Comparison of Detectability Index and Contrast Detection Probability
SO JOURNAL OF IMAGING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Autonomous vehicles rely on the detection and recognition of objects within images to successfully navigate. Design of camera systems is non-trivial and involves trading system specifications across many parameters to optimize performance, such as f-number, focal length, CFA choice, pixel, and sensor size. As such, tools are needed to evaluate and predict the performance of such cameras for object detection. Contrast Detection Probability (CDP) is a relatively new objective image quality metric proposed to rank the performance of camera systems intended for use in autonomous vehicles. Detectability index is derived from signal detection theory as applied to imaging systems and is used to estimate the ability of a system to statistically distinguish objects, most notably in the medical imaging and defense fields. A brief overview of CDP and detectability index is given after which an imaging model is developed to compare and explore the behavior of each with respect to camera parameters. Behavior is compared to matched filter detection performance. It is shown that, while CDP can yield a first order ranking of camera systems under certain constraints, it fails to track detector performance for negative contrast targets and is relatively insensitive.

AB This article considers collision avoidance (COLAV) for both static and moving obstacles using the branching-course model predictive control (BC-MPC) algorithm, which is designed for use by autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). The BC-MPC algorithm originally only considered COLAV of moving obstacles, so in order to make the algorithm also be able to avoid static obstacles, we introduce an extra term in the objective function based on an occupancy grid. In addition, other improvements are made to the algorithm resulting in trajectories with less wobbling. The modified algorithm is verified through full-scale experiments in the Trondheimsfjord in Norway with both virtual static obstacles and a physical moving obstacle. A radar-based tracking system is used to detect and track the moving obstacle, which enables the algorithm to avoid obstacles without depending on vessel-to-vessel communication. The experiments show that the algorithm is able to simultaneously avoid both static and moving obstacles, while providing clear and readily observable maneuvers. The BC-MPC algorithm is compliant with rules 8,13 and 17 of the the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs), and favors maneuvers following rules 14 and 15.

AB With the development of autonomous driving, task offloading of Internet of vehicles has become a hot research issue. In pedestrian-vehicle interaction scenarios, characteristics of tasks are constantly changing due to the influence of pedestrians and road conditions. Real-time offloading optimization and signaling are time-consuming, which may not meet the low delay requirement of task offloading. Therefore, this paper proposes a location prediction-based resource optimization scheme for task offloading in these scenarios. Firstly, the locations of pedestrians are predicted by the social force model based on their movement rules, and the locations of vehicles are predicted by the car-following model on the basis of ensuring pedestrian safety. The characteristics of tasks are obtained based on the predicted locations of vehicles. Then a neural network trained beforehand based on deep Q-learning is used to obtain a task offloading strategy. Since the tasks are obtained by prediction in advance, this strategy decision can be processed before vehicles arriving the predicted locations, which saves the time consumption of optimization and signaling. Besides, simulation results show that the proposed scheme still guarantees an acceptably low task offloading delay compared with the other methods, especially in congested areas.

ID RISK-ASSESSMENT; SAFETY; EVENTS; MODEL
AB This study introduces a machine learning model for near-crash prediction from observed vehicle kinematics data. The main hypothesis is that vehicles tend to experience discernible turbulence in their kinematics shortly before involvement in near-crashes. To test this hypothesis, the SHRP2 NDS vehicle kinematics data (speed, longitudinal acceleration, lateral acceleration, yaw rate, and pedal position) are utilized. Several machine learning algorithms are trained and comparatively analyzed including K nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest, support vector machine (SVM), decision trees, Gaussian naive Bayes (Gaussian NB), and adaptive boost (AdaBoost). Sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the optimal prediction horizon length (the time period before the occurrence of a near-crash) and the turbulence horizon length (the time period during which near-crash related changes in vehicle kinematics take place). The results indicate that optimal prediction performance can be achieved at a 1 s prediction horizons and a 3 s turbulence horizon. At these values, the AdaBoost model outperforms all other models in relation to its recall (100%), precision (98%), and F1-score (99%). These values imply that the near-crash prediction model is highly efficient in predicting most instances of near-crashes with minimal false near-crash predictions. This promising prediction performance offers a viable tool for supporting crash avoidance systems in the emerging connected/autonomous vehicle technology.

TI Automated Vehicles and Pedestrian Safety: Exploring the Promise and

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE

DT Article
AB Introduction: U.S. pedestrian fatalities have risen recently, even as vehicles are equipped with increasingly sophisticated safety and crash avoidance technology. Many experts expect that advances in automated vehicle technology will reduce pedestrian fatalities substantially through eliminating crashes caused by human error. This paper investigates automated vehicles' potential for reducing pedestrian fatalities by analyzing nearly 5,000 pedestrian fatalities recorded in 2015 in the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, virtually reconstructing them under a hypothetical scenario that replaces involved vehicles with automated versions equipped with state-of-the-art (as of December 2017) sensor technology.
   Methods: This research involved the following activities: (1) establish functional ranges of state-of-the-art pedestrian sensor technologies, (2) use data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System to identify pedestrian fatalities recorded in each state in the U.S. and District of Columbia in 2015, and (3) assess the maximum numbers of pedestrian fatalities that could have been avoided had involved vehicles been replaced with autonomous versions equipped with the described sensors. The research was conducted from July to December 2017.
   Results: Sensors' abilities to detect pedestrians in advance of fatal collisions vary from <30% to >90% of fatalities. Combining sensor technologies offers the greatest potential for eliminating fatalities, but may be unrealistically expensive. Furthermore, whereas initial deployment of automated vehicles will likely be restricted to freeways and select urban areas, non-freeway streets and rural settings account for a substantial share of pedestrian fatalities.
   Conclusions: Although technologies are being developed for automated vehicles to successfully detect pedestrians in advance of most fatal collisions, the current costs and operating conditions of those technologies substantially decrease the potential for automated vehicles to radically reduce pedestrian fatalities in the short term.

AB A cut-in or cut-off scenario involves a vehicle intruding into the path of another vehicle traveling in the same direction. These lane changes can lead to potentially dangerous situations, either a sideswipe or a rear-end crash. In this study, 552 cut-in events were analyzed, including four crash and 548 near-crash events from the Second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP-2) data set. Video and onboard-data-recorder data from the responding vehicle were used to analyze various factors associated with drivers' responses. Driver response times were measured from three different event onsets, and the effects of different factors on the respective response times were measured. These factors included the behavior of the subject driver, the behavior of the intruding vehicle/principal other vehicle (POV), and different environmental and infrastructural factors. The results showed that drivers responded more slowly when the POV took longer to move laterally to the subject driver's lane edge and faster when this time was short. Similarly, drivers responded faster to merging vehicles that started from a stop. Yet, response times were no different when the POV utilized a directional signal. These results point to a kinematic threshold involving lateral distance and lateral speed that best describes how drivers were triggered to respond. Drivers also responded faster near intersections, and at night. The results can be utilized to design crash mitigation systems in autonomous vehicles, as well as non-automated vehicles, to supplement human responses where their abilities may be lacking.

AB Plastics have been an indispensable material of choice in automobiles with wide range of applications such as interior, exterior, under the hood, and lighting/wiring applications. The prime motive of inclusion of these materials is increase in fuel efficiency and reduction in carbon footprint by replacing the energy intensive metallic counterparts. The current decade i. e., the 2020s has seen a recent surge in the sales of electronic vehicles. Although these numbers are promising, the growth in the rest of the parts of the world is not encouraging. It is primarily due to the skepticism involving battery life and efficiency, profitability, and environmental footprint when compared to conventional and hybrid vehicles. Also, a more concerted effort is needed in the lagging areas in order to install the required infrastructure. The emergence of plastics in the development and acceptance of e-vehicles is going to be pivotal especially when the efficiency and profitability are considered as they give the required freedom to the engineers for the design and development of various parts and sizes by replacing the bulkier and more dense materials. Also, the research on bionanocomposites has received great interest from the research community due to their versatility in application along with their eco-friendly nature throughout the lifecycle starting from feedstock up to end-of-life treatment. This review paper will be one of its kind to present a critical review of the recent developments of polymers suitable for use in e-vehicles. Also, a comprehensive discussion comprising of newer research areas for polymers in their use for e-vehicles will be presented.

AB Vehicle electrification, automation, and shared mobility - also referred to as the transportation three revolutions (3Rs) - are the emerging trends in future mobility. This study performed a comprehensive integrated analysis to investigate the potential future development of passenger transportation in the United States. A technical-economic mobility model, a chemical transport model, and a health impact assessment tool were utilized. This study first adopted several assumptions for vehicle sales under the impact of the 3Rs, and made projections to 2050 for vehicle stocks, distance travel, energy use, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. This study then quantified the impacts of changing emissions on concentrations of fine particulate matter and associated health benefits. Compared to a projected 2050 business-as-usual case, the wide use of electrification could lead to reductions of similar to 50% in petroleum consumption and similar to 75% in CO2 emissions, and obtain health benefits of 5500 prevented premature deaths, corresponding to $58 billion annually. The net energy impacts of automation are highly uncertain, and the improved efficiency from automation might be offset by an increase in travel. Sharing would bring additional benefits. The combination of the 3Rs could maximize the energy savings, carbon mitigations, and health benefits. The results of this study suggest that policies/incentives are needed to promote the transition from single-occupied conventional vehicles to shared electric vehicles.

AB Automated vehicles are expected to change the mobility landscape. Older adults living in both urban and peripheral areas may benefit from the availability of new automated modes due to increasing levels of accessibility. However, little is known about how seniors may make use of new automated mobility options. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to explore the mobility needs and desires of older adults in the province of Utrecht, the Netherlands, and assess how they envision the future usage of four distinct AV scenarios: automated public transport with fixed schedules, routes and timetables; automated on-demand public transport; fleet-based shared automated vehicles; and privately owned automated vehicles. Based on the results of a series of focus groups, findings demonstrate that study participants have a strong interest in using AVs in their daily life to overcome current accessibility and mobility barriers. Increases in flexibility due to on-demand booking, using the mode for access and egress to other modes of transport, as well as the option to travel together with friends were found to be important factors in having a positive attitude towards AV adoption. The findings of this study allow researchers, transport agencies and vehicle manufacturers to gain a broader understanding of the needs of older adults and take them into account in future AV design and policy development.

AB Magnetic coupling resonance wireless power transfer technology is one of the effective ways to solve the energy supply problem of autonomous underwater vehicles. As the most critical component in an underwater wireless power transfer system, the magnetic coupler largely determines the energy transfer capability and marine environment adaptability. This article proposes a novel ID-shaped magnetic coupler with a pendulum-type receiver, which has characteristics of compact structure, lightweight, enough mis-alignment tolerance, and high receiver power density. The design and optimization flow of the magnetic is given in detail in this article, and an experimental prototype is constructed to verify the proposal. The receiver weighs only 746 g, yet it can deliver over 3 kW at 95.985% dc-dc efficiency when fully aligned. Especially the proposal achieves stable output in the range of rotational and axial misalignment of [-30 mm, 30 mm], with a system efficiency consistently above 95% and efficiency fluctuations below 1%.

AB This paper proposes a control architecture of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for coverage mission in irregular region (CMIR) with an improved task planner. The CMIR control architecture is structured in four layers: perception layer, reactive layer, decision making layer and execution layer. To improve the task planner in decision making layer of control architecture, we adopted convex partitioning method and Success-History Based Adaptive Differential Evolution Algorithm (SHADE) including linear population size reduction (L-SHADE) as the computing engine, which make CMIR control architecture more suitable to coverage problems. Through statistical analysis, we obtained a set of optimized control parameters. Simulation experiments were carried out, three task planners were compared in terms of convergence speed, optimized path length and computing time consumption. The results show that the coverage efficiency of the task planner based on L-SHADE is higher than that of task planner based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and differential evolution (DE). Sea trial was performed with Sailfish-AUV, which proved that the CMIR control architecture is feasible in actual marine environment.

AB In this paper, we aim to design an autonomous tracking system for a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to localize a radio frequency (RF) mobile target. In the system, UAVs equipped with omnidirectional received signal strength (RSS) sensors can cooperatively search the target with a specified tracking accuracy. To achieve fast localization and tracking in the highly dynamic channel environment (e.g., time-varying transmit power and intermittent signal), we formulate a flight decision problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) with the main objective of avoiding redundant UAV flight path. Then, we propose an enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning to coordinate multiple UAVs performing real-time target tracking. The core of the proposed scheme is a feedback control system that takes into account the uncertainty of the channel estimate. We prove that the proposed algorithm can converge to the optimal decision. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms standard Q-learning and multi-agent Q-learning algorithms in terms of searching time and successful localization probability.

AB A new control method for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is developed to achieve three-dimensional (3D) path following under ocean current disturbances when AUV lacks lateral and vertical driving forces. To make the control system more convenient for practical application and reduce the energy consumption of AUV, the controller is designed with relative velocities. To avoid the singularity problem of curve path following, the Serret-Frenet frame is introduced as virtual target and the error model is defined. The adaptive law of the virtual target and an integral vector field (IVF) guidance law are designed in the kinematic controller. The back-stepping method and adaptive dynamical sliding mode control (BADSMC) technology are applied in the design of dynamic controller. The Lyapunov theory and nonlinear cascade system theory are applied to prove the closed-loop stability. Finally, the performances of the IVF + BADSMC and ILOS + PID algorithm are compared through simulation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller can realize the path following of AUV under disturbances of ocean current and can improve the following quality.

AB Exploration licences for seafloor mineral deposits have been granted across large areas of the world's oceans, with the abyssal Pacific Ocean being the primary target for polymetallic nodules-a potentially valuable source of minerals. These nodule-bearing areas support a large diversity of deep-sea life and although studies have begun to characterize the benthic fauna within the region, the ecological interactions between large bathypelagic vertebrates of the open ocean and the abyssal seafloor remain largely unknown. Here we report seafloor geomorphological alterations observed by an autonomous underwater vehicle that suggest large vertebrates could have interacted with the seafloor to a maximum depth of 4258m in the recent geological past. Patterns of disturbance on the seafloor are broadly comparable to those recorded in other regions of the world's oceans attributed to beaked whales. These observations have important implications for baseline ecological assessments and the environmental management of potential future mining activities within this region of the Pacific.

AB This paper deals with the design and implementation of two nonlinear control strategies to solve the path-tracking problem for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) under model uncertainties and external disturbances. First, the AUV model is transformed into the so-called regular form by an appropriate selection of state variables. Afterward, the trajectory tracking problem is treated under two different perspectives; on the one hand, the Block Backstepping Control (BBSC) design was employed, in this methodology, the system into the regular form is rewritten regarding the error tracking dynamics and then the control law is obtained through a Lyapunov function stability analysis. The other method is based on the second order sliding mode technique known as Generalized Super-Twisting Algorithm (GSTA) which offers a way to ensure robustness to modeling errors and bounded external disturbances. Both control laws are designed to maintain a minimum margin of error in the trajectory tracking of the AUV even in the presence of damping and buoyancy disturbances. Finally, experimental results are also provided to illustrate the performances of the closed-loop system using proposed controllers.

AB The focus of the paper is how to model autonomous behaviours of heterogeneous multi-agent systems such that it can be verified that they will always operate within predefined mission requirements and constraints. This is done by using formal methods with an abstraction of the behaviours modelling and model checking for their verification. Three case studies are presented to verify the decision-making behaviours of heterogeneous multi-agent system using a convoy mission scenario. The multi-agent system in a case study has been extended by increasing the number of agents and function complexity gradually. For automatic verification, model checker for multi-agent systems (MCMAS) is adopted due to its novel capability to accommodate the multi-agent system and successfully verifies the targeting behaviours of the team-level autonomous systems. The verification results help retrospectively the design of decision-making algorithms improved by considering additional agents and behaviours during three steps of scenario modification. Consequently, the last scenario deals with the system composed of a ground control system, two unmanned aerial vehicles, and four unmanned ground vehicles with fault-tolerant and communication relay capabilities.

AB We report results of preliminary high-resolution in situ atmospheric measurements through the boundary layer and lower atmosphere over the southern coast of PerA(0). This region of the coast is of particular interest because it lies adjacent to the northern coastal edge of the sub-tropical south-eastern Pacific, a very large area of ocean having a persistent stratus deck located just below the marine boundary layer (MBL) inversion. Typically, the boundary layer in this region during winter is topped by a quasi-permanent, well-defined, and very large temperature gradient. The data presented herein examine fine-scale details of the coastal atmosphere at a point where the edge of this MBL extends over the coastline as a result of persistent onshore flow. Atmospheric data were gathered using a recently-developed in-house constructed, GPS-controlled, micro-autonomous-vehicle aircraft (the DataHawk). Measured quantities include high-resolution profiles of temperature, wind, and turbulence structure from the surface to 1,300 m.

AB Impacts of vehicle automation and connectivity have been studied widely from the perspectives of fuel economy, ecology, and safety. Synthesis of various segments of this literature through review papers has also been presented. However, a systematic review is needed for the growing body of recent literature examining how energy consumption of automated vehicles is influenced by the advancements in powertrain operation and planning/control of driving patterns in different traffic conditions. To address this need, we have first developed an AI-based methodology to effectively find the most relevant papers from a very high volume of related literature. The methodology, comprising natural language processing and machine learning models with humans in the loop, has two phases: search query refinement and relevancy determination. The former ensures that almost all the potentially relevant papers are identified. The latter seeks to automatically eliminate (most) irrelevant papers. Application of our method reduced several thousands of papers from an initial step to 430 potentially relevant papers. Manual review of these papers further characterized many as irrelevant resulting in the final pool of 172 papers. We organized these papers based on various means of influencing power consumption, which are powertrain control, platooning, car-following, intersection management, speed planning, traffic control, lane changing, and on-ramp merging. Synthesis of the papers reveals that the existing studies vary greatly in their design, implementation, and comparison baselines, and thus offer widely differing predictions. Hence, more application specific and comprehensive studies are required to appropriately benchmark energy consumption impact of vehicle automation.

AB Platooning is one of the promising technologies that maximizes the power efficiency of electric vehicles by decreasing the distances between the vehicles. Along with the development of autonomous driving technology, platooning is expected to be commercialized. Recent studies on the operation of platooning focused on power-efficient maintenance of platooning. However, power-efficient operation strategy is also needed for practical applications. Therefore, this study deals with platooning operations that can maximize the power efficiency of electric vehicles in various operational situations. In order to derive the operation method, a mathematical model structured with an objective function that minimizes power consumption is developed. To derive the solution of the mathematical model, a hybrid genetic algorithm is applied. The numerical experiments on four different operational situations are performed to verify the validity of the model and the solution procedure. The four situations consider overall situation that can happen during the platooning stage. The stages are formation, disassembly, join and breakaway of vehicles of platoon. Those four situations are decided upon since they can represent the general situation that can happen during platooning. As a result, the power-efficient driving patterns of electric vehicles are identified. After the development of electric and systematic technology, operational technology for platooning will collaborate for the further improvement. Therefore, throughout consideration of the formation of platooning, technology will expand the sustainability of technological development.

   prediction
AB Trajectories prediction for vehicles is a key task in autonomous driving. This task is complicated by the presence of social interactions between vehicles and their physical constraints with the scene. From dominant and concealed characteristics of the driving scenarios, this paper proposes a distributed multi-attention generative adversarial network named DTMA-GAN. Firstly, temporal and spatial attention heads are used in the framework of DTMA-GAN to extract scene information, driving features of self-vehicles and social interaction features among vehicles. These features help the model learn the position in the large scene and capture the most salient parts of the image associated with the path. Secondly, a subset of the Euclidean space is modeled using the lane environment and a collision-free set of states is constructed to generate a safe driving area via the environment occupancy points set. Finally, the multiple trajectories with confidence generated by GAN are combined with this candidate driving area, and an accurate, reasonable, and long-term vehicle trajectory is selected using non-maximum suppression. And we use publicly available NGSIM and Argoverse datasets for model evaluation. Experimental results show that compared with CS-LSTM, GRIP and other excellent algorithms, this algorithm can effectively reduce the Root Mean Square Error for trajectory prediction in dynamic environments. And ablation experiments show that all the module components are effective.

AB The estimation of vehicle dynamics states is crucial for vehicle stability control and autonomous driv-ing, especially tire-force which governs vehicular motion. However, measuring tire-force directly needs expensive measurement instruments, moreover, vehicle non-linear characteristics, vehicle parameter uncertainties, unknown key variables, and sensor noise could cause great challenges in its observation. Therefore, this paper aims to develop an accurate, affordable tire-force estimator to tackle the above mentioned issues. A novel hierarchical estimation scheme based on random-walk square-root cubature Kalman filter (SCKF) is proposed and it works without a complex tire model and considers vehicle parameter uncertainties. The estimator scheme contains three blocks. The first block estimates related key variables of tire force observation. The second block estimates both vertical tire-force and longitudinal tire-force. The longitudinal tire-force is observed based on effective tire radius identification, and a proportional integral differential (PID) method is derived based on the Lyapunov principle. Then, a random-walk SCKF algorithm is presented to estimates lateral tire-force.

AB Crop-harvesting operations are typically carried out with combine harvesters. The harvested product is transferred to one or more tractors every time the combine harvester's storage capacity is reached. The efficiency of the process can be significantly improved by computing optimal routes and interactions for the harvest vehicles in the field. Furthermore, an automated method for generating itineraries for the harvest vehicles facilitates the planning for autonomous agricultural vehicles. The infield logistics problem is formulated as an integer linear programming vehicle routing problem with additional turn penalty constraints, but, because of the high number of decision variables, it is not possible to solve cases of realistic field size. The solution time of the infield logistics problem is considerably reduced by reformulating it as a modified minimum-cost network flow problem. This specific structure allows the exact solution of intermediate-size planning problems in a much shorter time period. The result of solving the infield logistics problem with the proposed modelling approaches is a set of itineraries ('tours'), covering the entire field. Each 'tour' is characterized by the combine harvester's start and end points and the positions where the combine harvester needs to be unloaded. The planning models minimize non-productivity (i.e. the time when a combine harvester travels in a field without harvesting). The results indicate that coordination between combine harvesters and tractors is also improved.

AB Robust systems are required for autonomous driving on non-uniform terrain commonly found in open-pit mines and developing countries. To help narrow the gap in this kind of application, this work proposes a perception system for autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance specialized on unpaved roads and off-road environments capable of navigating through rough terrain without a predefined trail. As part of this system, the Configurable Modular Segmentation Network (CMSNet) framework is proposed facilitating the creation of different architectures arrangements. Some CMSNet configurations were ported and trained to segment obstacles and trafficable ground on a new collection of images from unpaved roads and off-road scenarios containing adverse conditions such as night, rain, and dust. It was also performed: an investigation regarding the feasibility of applying deep learning to detect regions where the vehicle can pass through when there is no clear track boundary; a study of how our proposed segmentation algorithms behave in different severity levels of visibility impairment; and an evaluation of field tests carried out with semantic segmentation architectures conditioned for real-time inference. The new dataset (named Kamino) has almost 12,000 new images collected from an operated vehicle with various sensors, including eight cameras capturing synchronized sequences from different points of view. The Kamino dataset has a high number of labeled pixels compared to similar publicly available collections. It includes images collected from an off-road proving ground exclusively assembled for testing the system that emulates an open-pit mine scenario under different adverse conditions of visibility. To achieve embedded real-time inference and allows field tests, many layers of the CMSNet CNN networks were methodically removed and fused using TensorRT, C++, and CUDA. Empirical experiments on two datasets validated the effectiveness of the proposed system. The proposed solution achieves a mIoU of similar to 87% (50.40% higher than the PSPNet and 56.21% than the DeepLabV3) on the Kamino dataset, and similar to 81 % on the DepScene dataset, reaching up to 29 FPS on the RTX2060 GPU and almost 100 FPS with the optimized configurations, and low standard deviation values with the DrivePX2 computer platform.

DE LIDAR; localization; scan matching; particle filtering
ID TRANSFORMATION
AB This paper deals with the development of a localization methodology for autonomous vehicles using only a 3D LIDAR sensor. In the context of this paper, localizing a vehicle in a known 3D global map of the environment is equivalent to finding the vehicle's global 3D pose (position and orientation), in addition to other vehicle states, within this map. Once localized, the problem of tracking uses the sequential LIDAR scans to continuously estimate the states of the vehicle. While the proposed scan matching-based particle filters can be used for both localization and tracking, in this paper, we emphasize only the localization problem. Particle filters are a well-known solution for robot/vehicle localization, but they become computationally prohibitive as the states and the number of particles increases. Further, computing the likelihood of a LIDAR scan for each particle is in itself a computationally expensive task, thus limiting the number of particles that can be used for real-time performance. To this end, a hybrid approach is proposed that combines the advantages of a particle filter with a global-local scan matching method to better inform the resampling stage of the particle filter. We also use a pre-computed likelihood grid to speed up the computation of LIDAR scan likelihoods. Using simulation data of real-world LIDAR scans from the KITTI datasets, we show the efficacy of the proposed approach.

AB Nowadays, as the world is transformed because of the interconnectivity, there we see several issues regarding security which is supposed to be one of the biggest problems for the concept of smart cities. In future, aerial vehicles can be merged with smart cities to enhance the interoperability among internet of things (IoT) devices. Routing protocols plays an important role when flying vehicles communicate with one another. Reinforcing connection in flying ad hoc networks using routing protocols is the optimal way to reduce end-to-end delay. However, utilizing flying networks with the deployment of routing techniques is a very difficult task to tackle the dynamic pattern of aerial vehicles. Internet of flying vehicles is the emerging area which is still in the evolutionary process; however, the interconnectivity can be efficiently formulated by applying security algorithms for improving signal power. In unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), every node will have some specific location, direction, speed, velocity, and acceleration which will identify and relate information about mobility model. This paper proposes a novel routing technique, which is the extension of AntHocNet due to mobile characteristics; it is termed as flying nature inspired algorithm. Also a case study is conducted to improve the signal power using modeled learning approach called decision tree. Experimental simulations are managed on network simulators that prove the proposed work efficiency.

AB Localization is fundamental for autonomous vehicle applications. Compared with widely developed LiDAR-based vehicle localization, vision based localization has attracted considerable attention in recent years owing to the low-cost sensor. One of the challenges for visual localization is the outlier in measurements due to the appearance changes caused by illumination, season, and weather. To address this problem, we present a real-time robust visual localization approach that achieves deterministic optimality with global convergence. The idea is to decouple the rotation and translation estimation by utilizing the fact that the pitch and roll angles of the query pose are similar to those of the map reference pose, since the vehicle motion is locally planar. Based on the decoupled formulation, we first estimate the optimal yaw angle and eliminate the majority of outliers by an efficient inlier voting method, then find the optimal translation by maximum clique search. The two subproblem estimators are embedded into a prioritized search paradigm to guarantee deterministic optimality. In the experiments, the simulation demonstrates that the proposed method can achieve superior robustness even dealing with extreme outlier rates (95%). Results on both public and self-collected real-world vehicle datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the real application.

AB Vehicle automation has the potential to drastically transform transportation, with important implications for energy and the environment. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the impact of automation on travel demand and vehicle efficiency. We utilize the MARKet ALlocation (MARKAL) energy system model to examine four previously published scenarios that consider different effects of automation on efficiency and demand. We do not replicate detailed estimation of individual mechanisms but apply key outcomes from prior studies within a broader energy system framework. Our analysis adds insights on fuel switching, upstream impacts, and air emissions. MARKAL dynamically captures interactions between transportation and non-transportation sectors, which is important given that the revolutionary shifts from automation may invalidate static assumptions. Model results suggest that increasing travel demands from automation may boost fuel use and petroleum-based fuel prices, potentially increasing the market penetration of alternative-fuel vehicles. In contrast, dramatic efficiency improvements from automation could drive fuel prices lower, greatly reducing the competitiveness of alternative-fueled vehicles. Furthermore, these shifts could yield positive or negative environmental impacts. Some automation scenarios even resulted in counterintuitive results. For example, if high levels of efficiency improvement drive out alternative-fuel vehicles, such as battery electric and hybrids, a net worsening of air quality relative to the other scenarios could result. We also found system-level dynamics to be key. For example, reductions in liquid fuel prices led to increased consumption, and the resulting increase in air pollutant emissions offset a portion of the potential air quality benefits of automation.

AB Basic monitoring of the marine environment is crucial for the early warning and assessment of marine hydrometeoro-logical conditions, climate change, and ecosystem disasters. In recent years, many marine environmental monitoring platforms have been established, such as offshore platforms, ships, or sensors placed on specially designed buoys or submerged marine structures. These platforms typically use a variety of sensors to provide high-quality observations, while they are limited by low spatial resolution and high cost during data acquisition. Satellite remote sensing allows monitoring over a larger ocean area; however, it is susceptible to cloud contamination and atmospheric effects that subject the results to large uncertainties. Unmanned vehicles have become more widely used as platforms in marine science and ocean engineering in recent years due to their ease of deployment, mobility, and the low cost involved in data acquisition. Researchers can acquire data according to their schedules and convenience, offering significant im-provements over those obtained by traditional platforms. This study presents the state-of-the-art research on available unmanned vehicle observation platforms, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), underwater gliders (UGs), un-manned surface vehicles (USVs), and unmanned ships (USs), for marine environmental monitoring, and compares them with satellite remote sensing. The recent applications in marine environments have focused on marine biochem-ical and ecosystem features, marine physical features, marine pollution, and marine aerosols monitoring, and their in-tegration with other products are also analysed. Additionally, the prospects of future ocean observation systems combining unmanned vehicle platforms (UVPs), global and regional autonomous platform networks, and remote sens-ing data are discussed.

AB Energy consumption and emissions of a vehicle are highly influenced by road contexts and driving behavior. Especially, driving on horizontal curves often necessitates a driver to brake and accelerate, which causes additional fuel consumption and emissions. This paper proposes a novel optimal ecological (eco) driving scheme (EDS) using nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) considering various road contexts, i.e., curvatures and surface conditions. Firstly, a nonlinear optimization problem is formulated considering a suitable prediction horizon and an objective function based on factors affecting fuel consumption, emissions, and driving safety. Secondly, the EDS dynamically computes the optimal velocity trajectory for the host vehicle considering its dynamics model, the state of the preceding vehicle, and information of road contexts that reduces fuel consumption and carbon emissions. Finally, we analyze the effect of different penetration rates of the EDS on overall traffic performance. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated using microscopic traffic simulations under dense and mixed traffic environment, and it is found that the proposed EDS substantially reduces the fuel consumption and carbon emissions of the host vehicle compared to the traditional (human-based) driving system (TDS), while ensuring driving safety. The proposed scheme can be employed as an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) for semi-autonomous vehicles.

AB Planning the optimal trajectory of emergency avoidance maneuvers for highly automated vehicles is a complex task with many challenges. The algorithm needs to decrease accident risk by reducing the severity and keeping the car in a controllable state. Optimal trajectory generation considering all aspects of vehicle and environment dynamics is numerically complex, especially if the object to be avoided is moving. This paper presents a hierarchical method for the avoidance of moving objects in an autonomous vehicle, where a reinforcement learning agent is responsible for local planning, while longitudinal and lateral control is performed by the low-level model-predictive controller and Stanley controllers. In the developed architecture, the agent is responsible for the optimization. It is trained in various scenarios to provide the necessary parameters for a polynomial-based path and a velocity profile in a neural network output. The vehicle performs only the first step of the trajectory, which is redesigned repeatedly by the planner based on the new state. In the training phase, the vehicle executes the entire trajectory via low-level controllers to determine the reward value, which realizes a prediction for the future. The agent receives feedback and can further improve its performance. Finally, the proposed framework was tested in a simulation environment and was also compared to human drivers' abilities.

AB With the development of sensor fusion technologies, there has been a lot of research on intelligent ground vehicles, where obstacle detection is one of the key aspects of vehicle driving. Obstacle detection is a complicated task, which involves the diversity of obstacles, sensor characteristics, and environmental conditions. While the on-road driver assistance system or autonomous driving system has been well researched, the methods developed for the structured road of city scenes may fail in an off-road environment because of its uncertainty and diversity. A single type of sensor finds it hard to satisfy the needs of obstacle detection because of the sensing limitations in range, signal features, and working conditions of detection, and this motivates researchers and engineers to develop multi-sensor fusion and system integration methodology. This survey aims at summarizing the main considerations for the onboard multi-sensor configuration of intelligent ground vehicles in the off-road environments and providing users with a guideline for selecting sensors based on their performance requirements and application environments. State-of-the-art multi-sensor fusion methods and system prototypes are reviewed and associated to the corresponding heterogeneous sensor configurations. Finally, emerging technologies and challenges are discussed for future study.

ID BEHAVIOR; SYSTEM
AB Autonomous vehicles have gained popularity in recent years, but they are still not compatible with other vulnerable components of the traffic system, including pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists, and occupants of smaller vehicles such as passenger cars. This incompatibility leads to reduced system performance and undermines traffic safety and comfort. To address this issue, the authors considered pedestrian crosswalks where vehicles, pedestrians, and micro-mobility vehicles collide at right angles in an urban road network. These road sections are areas where vulnerable people encounter vehicles perpendicularly. In order to prevent accidents in these areas, it is planned to introduce a warning system for vehicles and pedestrians. This procedure consists of multi-stage activities by sending warnings to drivers, disabled individuals, and pedestrians with phone addiction simultaneously. This collective autonomy is expected to reduce the number of accidents drastically. The aim of this paper is the automatic detection of a pedestrian crosswalk in an urban road network, designed from both pedestrian and vehicle perspectives. Faster R-CNN (R101-FPN and X101-FPN) and YOLOv7 network models were used in the analytical process of a dataset collected by the authors. Based on the detection performance comparison between both models, YOLOv7 accuracy was 98.6%, while the accuracy for Faster R-CNN was 98.29%. For the detection of different types of pedestrian crossings, YOLOv7 gave better prediction results than Faster R-CNN, although quite similar results were obtained.

AB Ride-sharing services are transforming urban mobility by providing timely and convenient transportation to anybody, anywhere, and anytime. These services present enormous potential for positive societal impacts with respect to pollution, energy consumption, congestion, etc. Current mathematical models, however, do not fully address the potential of ride-sharing. Recently, a large-scale study highlighted some of the benefits of car pooling but was limited to static routes with two riders per vehicle (optimally) or three (with heuristics). We present a more general mathematical model for real-time high-capacity ride-sharing that (i) scales to large numbers of passengers and trips and (ii) dynamically generates optimal routes with respect to online demand and vehicle locations. The algorithm starts from a greedy assignment and improves it through a constrained optimization, quickly returning solutions of good quality and converging to the optimal assignment over time. We quantify experimentally the tradeoff between fleet size, capacity, waiting time, travel delay, and operational costs for low-to medium-capacity vehicles, such as taxis and van shuttles. The algorithm is validated with similar to 3 million rides extracted from the New York City taxicab public dataset. Our experimental study considers ride-sharing with rider capacity of up to 10 simultaneous passengers per vehicle. The algorithm applies to fleets of autonomous vehicles and also incorporates rebalancing of idling vehicles to areas of high demand. This framework is general and can be used for many real-time multivehicle, multitask assignment problems.

AB Environment perception, one of the most fundamental and challenging problems of autonomous vehicles (AVs), has been widely studied in recent decades. Due to inferior fault tolerance and the insufficient information caused by a single autonomous sensor (e.g., radar, lidar, or camera), multisensor fusion plays a significant role in environment perception systems, and its performance directly defines the safety of AVs. Due to good performance and low cost, radar-vision (RV) fusion has become popular and widely applied in the mass production of AVs. However, there have been a few generalizations about RV fusion, and in that context, this article presents a comprehensive review on RV fusion for both object detection and object tracking by RV fusion. With respect to the input data and fusion framework, this article categorizes the existing fusion frameworks into two categories, providing a detailed overview of each: object detection and tracking by RV fusion. Also, the state-of-the-art detectors and trackers based on deep learning are introduced, along with an analysis of their advantages and limitations. Finally, challenges and improvements are summarized to facilitate future research in the RV fusion field.

AB LiDAR-based 3D object detection pushes forward an immense influence on autonomous vehicles. Due to the limitation of the intrinsic properties of LiDAR, fewer points are collected at the objects farther away from the sensor. This imbalanced density of point clouds degrades the detection accuracy but is generally neglected by previous works. To address the challenge, we propose a novel two-stage 3D object detection framework, named SIENet. Specifically, we design the Spatial Information Enhancement (SIE) module to predict the spatial shapes of the foreground points within proposals, and extract the structure information to learn the representative features for further box refinement. The predicted spatial shapes are complete and dense point sets, thus the extracted structure information contains more semantic representation. Besides, we design the Hybrid-Paradigm Region Proposal Network (HP-RPN) which includes multiple branches to learn discriminate features and generate accurate proposals for the SIE module. Extensive experiments on the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark show that our elaborately designed SIENet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

AB As being increasingly used for underwater explorations, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are diversified in their structures and outlines to match up with various mission requirements, which brings challenges to the design of customized submerged docking stations. Aiming at providing a generalized solution, this paper proposes an omnidirectional and positioning-tolerant planar type AUV docking and charging platform, which has no constraints on AUV structures. In order to solve the planar-type docking issues, an integrated visual navigation and docking algorithm is developed for the miniaturized prototype AUV. The adopted monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) program takes charge of the wide-range underwater locationing, and handles practical problems such as scale drift and tracking failure. A combined control strategy of horizontal dynamic positioning and vertical visual servo docking is developed for the terminal docking process. The strategy is robust against constant water flow disturbance and performs stable docking using a roll motion adjustment. The visual navigation and docking performances and other system functions are successfully validated in simulation, water pool experiment, and sea trial.

AB This article proposes a computational trajectory optimization framework for solving the problem of multiobjective automatic parking motion planning. Constrained automatic parking maneuver problem is usually difficult to solve because of some practical limitations and requirements. This problem becomes more challenging when multiple objectives are required to be optimized simultaneously. The designed approach employs a swarm intelligent algorithm to produce the tradeoff front along the objective space. In order to enhance the local search ability of the algorithm, a gradient operation is utilized to update the solution. In addition, since the evolutionary process tends to be sensitive with respect to the flight control parameters, a novel adaptive parameter controller is designed and incorporated in the algorithm framework such that the proposed method can dynamically balance the exploitation and exploration. The performance of using the designed multiobjective strategy is validated and analyzed by performing a number of simulation and experimental studies. The results indicate that the present approach can provide reliable solutions and it can outperform other existing approaches investigated in this article.

ID AUV NAVIGATION; TECHNOLOGIES; SYSTEM
AB Database-referenced navigation (DBRN) using geophysical information is often implemented on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to correct the positional errors of the inertial navigation system (INS). The matching algorithm is a pivotal technique in DBRN. However, it is impossible to completely eliminate mismatches in practical application. Therefore, it is necessary to perform a mismatch detection method on the outputs of DBRN. In this paper, we propose a real-time triple constraint mismatch detection method. The proposed detection method is divided into three modules: the model fitting detection module, the spatial structure detection module, and the distance ratio detection module. In the model fitting detection module, the navigation characteristics of AUVs are used to select the fitting model. In the spatial structure detection module, the proposed method performs the mismatch detection based on the affine transformation relationship between the INS-indicated trajectory and the corresponding matched trajectory. In the distance ratio detection module, we derive the distance ratio constraint between the INS-indicated trajectory and the corresponding matched trajectory. Simulations based on an actual geomagnetic anomaly base map have been performed for the validation of the proposed method.

AB Security attacks on Cyber-Physical Systems with operations that involve Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are a matter of great concern due to their major impact in the deployed systems, and a deal-breaker for their utilization; if a system is not perceived as secure, either it will not be used or its capabilities will be underutilized, regardless of how good they could be. This happens with particular intensity in missions with UAVs, as they can be hacked to tamper with their collected data or taken away by unauthorized parties. Development of security countermeasures is extensive both in theoretical and practical implementations, but the integration of these measures can be difficult, and performance might be affected because of it. This manuscript puts forward a SEDIBLOFRA (Secure, Distributed, Blockchain-based Framework) for remote maneuvering of UAVs, based on several distributed systems technologies that pile up to provide complementary functionalities. Asymmetric cryptography encrypts the data. Publish/Subscribe communications offer a way to enhance data delivery. Finally, blockchain provides a way to keep all the transferred data in a redundant and immutable manner. The proposed framework is also extensible to other kinds of unmanned vehicles, like Unmanned Ground Vehicles or Autonomous Underwater Vehicles.

AB Underwater cameras increasingly are being used on remotely operated, autonomous, or towed vehicles to provide fishery-independent survey data in areas unsuitable for bottom trawls. To observe and quantify avoidance and attraction behaviors of fish to these vehicles, we developed an observational test bed consisting of 3 benthic stereo cameras, set in a straight line, on a coral reef in the Gulf of Mexico. During one pass of a towed camera vehicle, one of the benthic cameras viewed a school of vermilion snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens) that exhibited a variety of avoidance behaviors. Stereo analysis was used to position some these fish, and target tracking was used to estimate their swimming performance and schooling characteristics for each second from the time the research vessel had passed the benthic cameras to the time of arrival of the towed underwater vehicle. The fish showed little reaction to the tow vessel but responded to the tow cable by swimming laterally and downward, then rapidly increased their swimming speed and avoidance behavior when the towed vehicle came into view. The use of observational test beds, stereo photography, and target tracking allows quantification of the avoidance response and provides a means to determine which stimuli produced by the sampling process elicit fish avoidance behaviors.

AB The future of mobility involves the interconnection of the entities of the transportation system (vehicles, roads, traffic lights, pedestrians) in high speed networks providing real-time information to drivers, entertainment for passengers, and a wide variety of applications and systems dedicated to smart transportation. Furthermore, in a few years, autonomous vehicles are going to massively reach the streets, and their interconnection may drastically improve the urban mobility by reducing the travel time and the number of accidents. In this work, we consider the design and management of the network infrastructure for vehicular communication focusing on streaming delivery. We intend to allow a given share of vehicles driving along the road network permanently playing streams received from the network infrastructure, and our main question is where we must provide coverage for achieving a given share of vehicles receiving the media. As parameters, we consider the download data rate that vehicles receive content from the infrastructure, and data consumption rate inside vehicles. An Integer Linear Program formulation along with a tabu search-based heuristic are presented. We consider as baseline the intuitive deployment strategy of covering the most popular locations of the road network. All strategies are evaluated considering a realistic vehicular mobility trace composed of 75, 515 vehicles. Results indicate that the tabu search heuristic is able to solve a large instance composed of 75, 515 vehicles requiring less covered area than greedy heuristics. Considering the optimal solution, we investigate the solutions on a reduced subset composed of 100 vehicle trips and, considering this reduced scenario, the tabu search heuristic is able to find the optimal solution.

AB Given the rise of automated vehicles from an engineering and technical perspective, there has been increased research interest concerning the Human and Computer Interactions (HCI) between vulnerable road users (VRUs, such as cyclists and pedestrians) and automated vehicles. As with all HCI challenges, clear communication and a common understanding-in this application of shared road usage-is critical in order to reduce conflicts and crashes between the VRUs and automated vehicles. In an effort to solve this communication challenge, various external human-machine interface (eHMI) solutions have been developed and tested across the world. This paper presents a timely critical review of the literature on the communication between automated vehicles and VRUs in shared spaces. Recent developments will be explored and studies analyzing their effectiveness will be presented, including the innovative use of Virtual Reality (VR) for user assessments. This paper provides insight into several gaps in the eHMI literature and directions for future research, including the need to further research eHMI effects on cyclists, investigate the negative effects of eHMIs, and address the technical challenges of eHMI implementation. Furthermore, it has been underlined that there is a lack of research into the use of eHMIs in shared spaces, where the communication and interaction needs differ from conventional roads.

AB One of the challenges before the introduction of automatic driving are unsignalized inner city intersections. There deadlock situations are possible, which are not cleary regulated. Those involved have to cooperate in that case, which is challenging for automatic vehicles. The presented algorithm is able to make behavior decisions for automatic vehicle guidance. This decision depends on the situation and the behavior of the remaining traffic participants. The decision-making model is designed as a discrete event system, which is especially beneficial regarding the transparency of the decisions. The model is presented in detail alongside the features and events used for it and is validated by a simulation on maps of real intersections.

AB Off-road vehicles always experience serious uncertain longitudinal and lateral slips when running on soft and slope terrains, and some parameters of the vehicles, such as the cornering stiffness and the slip of wheels, are always not constants. In this paper, control strategies for the torque of each wheel and the rear-wheel-steering angle are proposed to maintain a stable velocity and approach an ideal reference model for the off-road vehicle by using second-order sliding mode (SOSM) techniques. An observer is constructed to estimate the actual sideslip angle of the vehicle with the consideration of uncertainties and disturbances of the system. Then, with conditions of bounded uncertainties and disturbances, composite super-twisting (ST) controllers combined with a velocity controller are designed to generate the total torque, the differential torque, and the rear-wheel-steering angle. On this basis, the proposed controllers have been verified to lead good robustness for maintaining the stable velocity and approaching the ideal reference model by using an optimal torque allocation controller at a lower layer. In comparison with conventional yaw moment controllers without the rear-wheel-steering control, the proposed controllers are shown to be more effective.

TI Model-Based Estimation of Vehicle Center of Gravity Height and Load
SO JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME
LA English
DT Article
ID REAL-TIME ESTIMATION; PARAMETER
AB With an increasing number of driver assistance functions and the upcoming trend of autonomous driving, knowledge of the current state and changeable parameters of the vehicle becomes more and more important. One particularly significant parameter with regard to vehicle dynamics is the center of gravity (COG) height, which mainly accounts for its roll dynamics in combination with the mass of the vehicle. Thus, a highly increased vehicle mass and COG height might lead to rollover during cornering, which underlines the need for accurate knowledge of the load of the vehicle. Based on that, an improved rollover prevention could be implemented, for instance, by enhancing the electronic stability program (ESP) of the vehicle. Therefore, the main contribution of this work is the model-based online estimation of the additional load of the vehicle, comprising its COG position and mass. This is achieved by applying a joint extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for the simultaneous state and parameter estimation. Based on a nonlinear model with roll, pitch, and vertical dynamics, an accurate and reliable estimation is possible. One major novelty of this work is the consideration of air suspension systems on top of conventional steel spring suspension systems. Therefore, a nonlinear air spring model with sufficient complexity is proposed, making it suitable for real-time applications. Further, a system theoretical observability analysis allows for an online adaptation of the Kalman Filter weights in order to account for different driving situations. The proposed estimation method is tested and validated by considering a wide range of driving situations, considering distinct loading conditions on both a test track and public roads. The estimation accuracy lies within roughly 50 kg and 1.5 cm for the vehicle mass and COG height, respectively.

AB In this article, we address the task of cooperative path following control of multiple autonomous quadcopters in the presence of unknown external disturbances. Under the assumption that the communications among the vehicles are bidirectional and continuous, a synchronized path following strategy is proposed that regulates the speed of each vehicle along its path to reach consensus in relative position. Moreover, collision-free transient paths from the vehicle initial positions to a group of suitable selected positions along the desired paths are designed. Building on the backstepping technique, the proposed path following controller for each individual vehicle drives the quadcopter toward, and to stay within an arbitrarily small neighborhood of its corresponding desired path, achieving global uniformly ultimately boundedness. In addition, the devised controller guarantees that the actuations are bounded with respect to the position error. The controller is also made robust to external constant or slowly time-varying disturbances by the introduction of dynamic estimators for the disturbances. A projection operator is used to ensure that the estimates remain within the prescribed bounds and are sufficiently smooth to be backstepped. In order to validate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed methodology, we present and analyze both simulation and experimental results.

AB Motion planning by considering it as an optimal problem is an effective and widely applicable method. Its comprehensive performance greatly depends on the vehicle dynamics model, which is highly coupled and nonlinear, especially under the dynamical scenarios and causes much more consumption of computation resources for the numerical optimization. To increase the real time performance of the motion planner designed by nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), a unified and simplified vehicle dynamics model (SDM) is presented to make a balance between the accuracy and complexity for dynamical driving scenarios. Based on the statistical analysis results of naturalistic driving conditions, a unified nonlinear vehicle dynamics model is set up, which considers the tyre cornering characteristic and is also applicable to conditions with large turning angle. After the validation of this coupled dynamics model (CDM) by comparisons with other widely used models under a variety of conditions, the coupling effect is analyzed according to the transfer functions, which are obtained by linearizing CDM at equilibrium points. Furthermore, SDM is derived by ignoring the weak part of the coupling effect. The accuracy of SDM is validated by several comparative studies with other models and it is further applied to design a motion planner by NMPC to validate its contribution on the performance improvement under dynamical driving conditions.

AB This paper proposes a driver preview-based path-following controller to control both the lateral and longitudinal movements of a vehicle. First, a lateral tracking controller with two preview points is established by considering the displacement and heading errors of the two preview points: the far point, determined by the vehicle speed and fixed preview time, and the near point located at the center of the front axle. Depending on different parameters of the road input, the steering wheel angle is calculated, and different weights are assigned to the steering wheel angles corresponding to different road inputs. Next, a longitudinal tracking controller is established, which controls the vehicle velocity based on the road information of the far point. The control objects are the brake and accelerator pedals. Subsequently, the coupling of the lateral and longitudinal motion of the vehicle is analyzed, and an integrated longitudinal and lateral tracking controller is established. To verify the performance of the controller, the controller and vehicle model are established in Simulink and CarSim, respectively, to enable joint simulation. It is observed that the coupling is solved, and the near-point control makes the tracking error converge to zero and enhances the control effect. It demonstrates high adaptability and control accuracy of the proposed controller.

AB Driving maneuver decision-making is critical to the development and mass deployment of automated vehicles (AVs). The prevailing approaches are stuck with either specific optimization objectives or separate maneuver planning. Inspired by the inherent driving mechanism of human beings, we develop a comprehensive deep learning scheme that extracts and establishes informative image-based representation of dynamic traffic flows and then learns driving strategies from collected driving datasets based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our scheme can effectively capture comprehensive and dynamic features of traffic flows surrounding the ego car and construct dynamic motion images through processing the spatio-temporal signals of all neighbor cars. These constructed virtual images cover all informative dynamic states of the neighbor cars, located in the maneuver-critical area, defined as the motion-sensitive area (MSA). Then, sequential spatio-temporal images together with labeled driving behaviors are fed into our proposed CNN model. The network can extract underlying motion patterns and learn proper driving behaviors, including both the lateral maneuver and longitudinal speed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in a typical highway scenario. Results suggest that the proposed scheme merits further investigation to promote the launch of AVs.

AB In this paper, a hybrid underwater robotic vehicle (HURV), which combines the advantages of autonomous underwater vehicle and remotely operated vehicle, is introduced. The vehicle system consists of an onboard system with a set of embedded PC/104 computers and a surface monitoring station based on the client-server supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. Correspondingly, a two-layer software architecture composed of a monitoring layer and a task layer is presented, and they are inserted into the surface and onboard systems, respectively. The task layer includes four kinds of tasks - perception task, communication task, motion control task and fault treatment task. Subsequently, the design and implementation for multiple tasks running in the task layer are described in detail. Furthermore, under the above software architecture, a model-free fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative (FAD) controller is applied to heading control task at different speed profiles, in consideration of the simplified implementation on the PC/104 computer. Numerical simulation results quantitatively illustrate the designed FPID controller performs better than the classic PID controller, especially in the rise time, settling time, and overshot. Finally, tank experiments are performed to test the performance of the entire onboard system of the developed HURV with the integrated software architecture and FPID control algorithm.

AB Online flexible operation of a car-like mobile vehicle with non-holonomic constraints in dynamic environment is still a very challenging problem because the surrounding Situations are not qualified in static, knowledge is only partial and the execution is often associated with uncertainty. The difficulty lies in the setting of appropriate moving sub-targets in real-time to obtain a collision-free and low-cost path. In this paper, we present a new approach for the autonomous motion control of mobile vehicle in a narrow area with static and dynamic obstacles. It is based on the selection of sub-target points of vehicle's movement called 'soft target which is a target set defined as all possible and reachable via-points in a navigation space. The soft target is acquired by online learning based on the final target and environment information. Each element of it has its membership value in [0, 1] denoting its evaluation degree. With the acquired soft target, soft decision is made like human's decision process by predictive fuzzy Control (PFC) to achieve final target safely and economically. The simulation results show the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed vehicle motion control method. (C) 2009 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB The possibility of having driverless cars on the streets seems to be more real than ever. In this paper, we focus on developing exact methods that can determine the effects of privately owned automated vehicles (AVs) and how switching to those vehicles is going to change mobility in urban environments. The considered problem determines the routes of family owned AVs that minimize the transportation costs of that family while considering the possibility of using public transport as an alternative for some trips. We introduce a novel exact linear formulation for this problem which includes a linearized traffic congestion model and which is able to solve the user and system optimum variant of the problem to optimality. The introduced formulation can easily be adapted to consider the current situation with conventional vehicles and a situation where not only the travel time costs of the driver but also costs of the other passengers are taken into account. The main advantage of our novel formulation is that the optimal results can be obtained to explore potential changes of flows with vehicle automation in small networks. We investigated the behavior of the system, given the described scenarios, by applying our formulation to a case study.

AB As the era of intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) is approaching, a number of studies have investigated the potential benefits of ICVs, including the safety effects. Although previous studies agree that ICVs would significantly improve traffic safety, its quantified safety effects at different stages are still being debated. This study aims to estimate the ICVs' safety effects by market penetration rate (MPR) adopting a meta-analysis approach. The results from the meta-analysis indicate that the number of conflicts is exponentially reduced as the MPR goes up. For example, compared to the environment without ICVs, 4.2% and 17.4% of conflicts would decrease at the MPR of 10% and 50%, respectively. The effects are more obvious at higher MPR-43.4% of conflicts are expected to decrease at the MPR of 90%. From the case study in the United States based on the meta-analysis, it is expected that the MPR would reach 17-20% in the near future (2025) and 40-48% in 2035. The anticipated reduction in the number of fatal crashes would be 5% and 13%, in 2025 and 2035, respectively. The findings from this study will be useful for both public and private sectors to establish strategic plans to promote ICVs and identify their benefits at different MPRs.

AB We consider a setting where multiple vehicles form a team cooperating to visit multiple target points and collect rewards associated with them. The team objective is to maximize the total reward accumulated over a given time interval. Complicating factors include uncertainties regarding the locations of target points and the effectiveness of collecting rewards, differences among vehicle capabilities, and the fact that rewards are time-varying. We present a Receding Horizon (RH) control scheme which dynamically determines vehicle trajectories by solving a sequence of optimization problems over a planning horizon and executing them over a shorter action horizon. A key property of this scheme is that the trajectories it generates are stationary, in the sense that they ultimately guide vehicles to target points, even though the controller is not designed to perform any discrete point assignments. The proposed scheme is centralized and it induces a cooperative behavior. We subsequently develop a distributed cooperative controller which does not require a vehicle to maintain perfect information on the entire team and whose computational cost is scalable and significantly lower than the centralized case, making it attractive for applications with real-time constraints. We include simulation-based comparisons between the centralized algorithm and the distributed version, which illustrate the effectiveness of the latter. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Machines are empowered with ever-increasing agency and decision-making authority to augment or even replace humans in various settings, making responsibility attribution less straightforward when they cause harm. Focusing on their applications in transportation, we consider human judgments of responsibility for automated vehicle crashes through a cross-national survey (N = 1657) and design hypothetical crashes after the 2018 Uber automated vehicle crash reportedly caused by a distracted human driver and an inaccurate machine driver. We examine the association between automation level-the human and machine drivers have different levels of agency (i.e., the human as a supervisor, backup driver, and mere passenger, respectively)-and human responsibility through the lens of perceived human controllability. We show the negative association between automation level and human responsibility, partly mediated by perceived human controllability, regardless of the involved responsibility metric (rating and allocation), the nationality of the involved participant (China and South Korea), and crash severity (injury and fatality). When the human and machine drivers in a conditionally automated vehicle jointly cause a crash (e.g., the 2018 Uber crash), the human driver and car manufacturer are asked to share responsibility. Our findings imply that the driver-centric tort law needs to be control-centric. They offer insights for attributing human responsibility for crashes involving automated vehicles.

   connected and autonomous vehicles; construction; camera detection
AB The United States has over three trillion vehicle miles of travel annually on over four million miles of public roadways, which require regular maintenance. To maintain and improve these facilities, agencies often temporarily close lanes, reconfigure lane geometry, or completely close the road depending on the scope of the construction project. Lane widths of less than 11 feet in construction zones can impact highway capacity and crash rates. Crash data can be used to identify locations where the road geometry could be improved. However, this is a manual process that does not scale well. This paper describes findings for using data from onboard sensors in production vehicles for measuring lane widths. Over 200 miles of roadway on US-52, US-41, and I-65 in Indiana were measured using vehicle sensor data and compared with mobile LiDAR point clouds as ground truth and had a root mean square error of approximately 0.24 feet. The novelty of these results is that vehicle sensors can identify when work zones use lane widths substantially narrower than the 11 foot standard at a network level and can be used to aid in the inspection and verification of construction specification conformity. This information would contribute to the construction inspection performed by agencies in a safer, more efficient way.

AB In this paper, an all-wheel independently driven and all-wheel independently steered unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) is described. This paper investigates the hierarchical chassis yaw dynamics control (CYDC) and the tyre force control of the UGV in the remote control mode (RCM). The hierarchical CYDC scheme in RCM is proposed. As the key part in the control scheme, a yaw moment controller is proposed to deal with the oversteer problem of the UGV. Through the robust-based pole placement technique, the ideal poles' zones of the lateral UGV dynamics system are able to be tuned to meet different dynamics behavior requirements in different UGV tasks. The robust state feedback yaw dynamics controller is investigated based on the linear matrix inequalities approach. It considers the unavoidable parametric disturbance and uncertainty, such as the variation of the UGV's mass, yaw inertia, and tyreroad characteristics. In addition, in order to improve its performance in off-road conditions, the tyre traction force distribution algorithm and sliding mode wheel slip controller are designed to negotiate uneven terrains. The experiments in paved and off-road conditions are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller.

AB The emergence of automated vehicles (AV) has been occurring rapidly as these vehicles have the potential to reduce/eradicate human driving faults and related collisions. To enhance AV safety, the NHTSA recommends the continuous presence of a backup human driver that has a reasonable understanding of AV technologies to ensure disengagement when manual overtake is required. However, due to several AV-related traffic crashes during roadway testing and extensive media interest, AV safety has become a critical issue. This study collected 255 crash reports filed by different manufacturers testing AVs in California from September 2014 to April 2020. The crash dataset was analyzed using two data mining algorithms (association rule mining and text network analysis) to identify the key AV-related crash attributes and their associations based on the vehicle's prior driving mode (conventional or automated). The results show that the manner of collision and the prior movement of the testing vehicle are strongly connected with prior driving mode. For example, AV crashes in a manual driving mode often result in a sideswipe collision during moving status, whereas AV crashes in an automated driving mode are highly associated with rear-end collisions when AVs are stopped in traffic. The findings of this study can help policymakers and AV engineers improve AV deployment strategies to support the adoption of AVs and promote potential safety benefits for AV technologies.

AB Predictive Energy Management (PrEM) research is at the forefront of modern transportation's energy consumption reduction efforts. The development of PrEM optimization algorithms has been tailored to selfish vehicle operation and implemented in the form of vehicle dynamics and/or adaptive powertrain control functions. With the progress in vehicle automation, this paper focuses on extending PrEM into the realm of a System of Systems (SoS). The proposed approach uses the shared information among Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV) and the infrastructure to synthesize a reduced energy speed trajectory at the cohort level within urban environments. Neuroevolution is employed to incorporate a generalized optimum controller, robust to the emergent behaviors typical of multi-agents SoS. The authors demonstrated the use of heuristics and systems engineering processes in abstracting and integrating the resulting neural network within the control architecture, which enables novel added-value features such as green wave pass/fail classification and e-Horizon velocity prediction. The resulting controller is faster than real-time and was validated with a multi-agent simulation environment and on a real-world closed-loop track at the American Center for Mobility (ACM). The GM Bolt and Volt CAV mixed cohort testing at ACM demonstrated energy reductions from 7% to 22% depending on scenarios.

ID TRACKING
AB The traffic infrastructure of a city requires evaluation and improvement through a large amount of data analysis. The construction and laborious work of traditional methods make computer vision flourish in traffic analysis. Among different computer vision technologies for intelligent transportation system, one of the most important algorithms is multiple object tracking (MOT). At present, MOT used in traffic analysis has several shortcomings, such as lack of the output of vehicle speed and movement direction, and the consideration of single factor in trajectory tracking. These limitations have affected the results of traffic analysis. This research proposes an end-to-end deep learning network, called PairingNet. In addition to retaining the function and accuracy of the original detection network, PairingNet integrates the calculation of vehicle trajectory into the network through the feature fusion of consecutive images, which is introduced to predict the movement direction and speed of the vehicle. These additional features can be used to better track the trajectories of vehicles. In addition, a pipeline is designed to reduce the loading latency incurred by using the consecutive frames as the input for PairingNet. The experiment results indicate that the vehicle identification of PairingNet reaches 96% accuracy, surpassing the original YOLOv3 as the backbone structure, and reaches a near 100% accuracy rate in the predicted vehicle position. Moreover, with the pipeline process, the inference speed of PairingNet is very close to the original YOLOv3. In MOT results, the MOTA of PairingNet also has a high performance of 91%.

AB Lightweight Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) were developed for Naval Special Warfare (NSW) Group 4 search and survey missions from a commercial AUV baseline (Iver 2) through integration of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware components, and through software development for enhanced on-board Command and Control functions. The development period was 1 year under a project sponsored by the Office of Naval Research TechSolutions Program Office. Hardware integration was completed by the commercial AUV vendor, OceanServer Technology, Inc., and software development was conducted by the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Naval Oceanographic Office, and U MASS Dartmouth, with support from hardware and software application providers (YSI, Inc., Imagenex Technology Corp., and CARIS). At the conclusion of the integration and development period, an at-sea performance evaluation was scheduled for the Lightweight NSW AUVs with NSWG-4 personnel. The venue for this evaluation was the NATO exercise Recognized Environmental Picture 10A (REP 10A), hosted by Marinha Portuguesa, and coordinated by the Faculdade de Engenharia-Universidade do Porto. REP 10A offered an opportunity to evaluate the performance of the new AUVs and to explore the Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for employing them in military survey operations in shallow coastal waters. Shore- and ship-launched scenarios with launch/recovery by a single operator in a one-to-many coordinated survey, on-scene data product generation and visualization, data push to Reach Back Cells for product integration and enhancement, and survey optimization to streamline survey effort and timelines were included in the CONOPS review. Opportunities to explore employment of hybrid AUV fleets in Combined Force scenarios were also utilized. The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Marinha Portuguesa, the Faculdade de Engenharia-Universidade do Porto, and OceanServer Technology, Inc., were the primary participants bringing in-water resources to REP 10A. Technical support and products were provided by the Naval Research Laboratory-Stennis Space Center, Naval Oceanographic Office, NATO Undersea Research Centre, University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth, and YSI, Inc. REP 10A proved to be a very effective exercise in meeting each of the critical goals. Results of the performance evaluation guided final development and Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) for the Lightweight NSW AUV, leading to on-time, successful Factory Acceptance Testing and delivery of the three contracted vehicles to NSWG-4 in September, 2010.

AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies are under constant improvement with pilot programs now underway in several urban areas worldwide. Modeling and field-testing efforts are demonstrating that shared mobility coupled with AV technology for automated mobility on-demand (AMoD) service may significantly impact levels of service and environmental outcomes in future cities. Given these rapidly emerging developments, there is an urgent need for methods to adequately quantify the economic impacts of new vehicle technologies and future urban mobility policy. In this paper, we show how broader user-centric impacts can be captured by the activity-based accessibility (ABA) measure, which takes advantage of the rich data and outcomes of utility-maximization activity-based models and its interaction with mesoscale agent-based traffic simulation frameworks. Using the SimMobility simulator, we evaluate shared AMoD strategies applied to a Singapore micromodel city testbed. A near-future strategy of exclusive availability of AMoD service in the central business district (CBD), and a further-horizon strategy of the full operation of AMoD city-wide in the absence of other on-demand services, were tested and evaluated. Our results provide insights into the income and accessibility effects on the population under the implementation of shared and automated mobility policies. The outcomes indicate that the city-wide deployment of AMoD results in greater accessibility and network performance. Moreover, the accessibility of low-income individuals is improved relative to that of mid- and high-income individuals. The restriction of AMoD to the CBD along with the operation of other on-demand services, however, provides a certain level of disbenefit to segments of the population in two exceptional cases. The first is to high-income individuals who live in a suburban zone and rely heavily on on-demand services; the second is to mid-income residents that have excellent public transportation coverage with close proximity to the CBD. We further establish the efficacy of the ABA measure, as these findings motivate the need for measuring socioeconomic impacts at the individual level. The work presented here serves as a foundation for policy evaluation in real-world urban models for future mobility paradigms.

AB Understanding how new technologies such as on-demand ride hailing and vehicle automation may affect travel behavior is important to craft better policy. This study uses a 2018 survey of 1,684 employed respondents from vehicle-holding households residing in Southern Ontario, Canada. Stated preference choice experiments are administered and mixed logit models are estimated to explore consumer interest in adopting driverless ondemand vehicles, shared on-demand vehicles, transit plus on-demand vehicles, and driverless public transit shuttles. Monetized generalized costs of each of these choice attributes are estimated. Results indicate generalized costs from combining transit with on-demand ride hailing (a frequently contemplated "last-mile" solution), while users are relatively ambivalent about the generalized cost of shared on-demand ride-hailing. Results indicate that consumers view driverless public transit shuttles and driverless cars as conferring higher generalized costs than vehicles with drivers. Overall, results suggest that the market shares of these modes depend on the potential for service providers to capitalize on heterogenous preferences among consumers. As such, insofar that public transit agencies and the public sector appear less well-suited to nimbly meet heterogeneous consumer demand, the private sector appears poised to play the most direct role in leveraging these new technologies towards meeting user needs. In turn, these findings suggest that the best role for the public sector with respect these new services lies in establishing incentives by engaging with private industry and/or regulating downstream impacts of new mobility services.

AB Time-varying capacity design holds an opportunity to reduce the energy consumption of urban mass transit systems, e.g., urban rail transits, bus rapid transits, modular autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we investigate the joint design of dispatch headway and vehicle capacity for one to one shuttle systems with oversaturated traffic to achieve the optimal tradeoff between general vehicle dispatching cost (mainly comprised of vehicle energy consumption) and customer waiting cost. We propose a continuum approximation model from a macroscopic point of view to reveal fundamental analytical insights into the optimal design. By introducing the concept of a preferred virtual arrival demand curve at the origin station, we prove that the investigated problem with possibly oversaturated traffic can be equivalently solved with a simpler revised problem where only unsaturated traffic is present. With this property, we decompose the original problem into a set of independent unit-time revised unsaturated problems that can be analytically solved in each neighborhood across the operational horizon. With two sets of numerical experiments, we show that the CA model offers near-optimum solutions with negligible errors very efficiently and we also verify the theoretical properties. Also, the effectiveness of time-varying vehicle capacity design is demonstrated in shuttle systems under both saturated and unsaturated traffic. Overall, the proposed CA model contributes to the CA methodology literature by extending the CA method for traditional transit dispatching problems with unsaturated traffic to the joint design of dispatch headway and vehicle capacity considering oversaturated traffic, adjustable vehicle capacities and other factors (e.g. minimum dispatch headway).

ID TIRE FORCE ESTIMATION
AB We present a method for estimating the net traction and resistive wheel torques for a suspension less, differential-steered robot on rigid or deformable terrain. The method, based oil extended Kalman-Bucy filtering (EKBF), determines time histories of net traction and resistive wheel torques and wheel slips during steady or transient maneuvers. This method assumes good knowledge of the vehicle dynamics and treats the unknown forces and moments due to terrain response as random variables to be estimated. A proprioceptive sensor suite renders a subset of the unknown forces and associated wheel slip and slip angles observable. This methodology decouples semi-empirical terramechanics models from the net effect of the vehicle-terrain interaction, namely the net traction developed by the vehicle on the terrain. By collecting sensor data and processing data off-line, force-slip characteristics arc identified irrespective of the underlying terramechanics. These characteristics call in turn support development or validation of terramechanics models for the vehicle-terrain system. For autonomous robots, real-time estimates of force-slip characteristics can provide setpoints for traction and steering control, increasing vehicle performance, speed, and maneuverability. Finally, force-slip estimation is the first step in identifying terrain parameters during normal maneuvering. The methodology is demonstrated through both simulation and physical testing using a 13-kg robot. (C) 2008 ISTVS. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Fleet performance and cost evaluation of a shared autonomous electric
   vehicle (SAEV) fleet: A case study for Austin, Texas
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
ID OPERATIONS; NETWORK
AB Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) have gained significant public interest as a possible less expensive, safer and more efficient version of today's transportation networking companies (TNCs) and taxis. One way to expand on the possible benefits of an SAV fleet is through electric vehicles (EVs), which tend to be more energy efficient, more reliable, quicker, and may reduce system-wide emissions when coupled with renewable power. EVs are quickly becoming more financially viable as the price of these vehicles drops and charging infrastructure is appearing in more and more locations across the world. EVs are disadvantaged by their relatively short range and long recharge times, so it is important to understand how these factors will affect an electrified SAV (SAEV) fleet in terms of vehicle miles traveled (VMT), vehicle productivity, and response times.
   Perhaps the most important factor to consider before implementation is cost, since it is quite unlikely that a fleet operator will elect to use an EV fleet when a gasoline fleet is more profitable. This study makes in-depth estimates of the cost of this SAEV fleet based on vehicle purchasing costs, vehicle maintenance, batteries, electricity, charger construction (including land acquisition and paving), charger maintenance, insurance, registration and general administrative costs. These costs are estimated at low-, high- and mid-cost scenarios, where mid-cost is the most expected.
   This study performed a simulation of SAEVs across the Austin, Texas 6-county region under 6 different fleet scenarios to assess what factors make the fleet the most profitable and provide the best customer experience. The simulation process features thoughtful charging strategies, dynamic ridesharing, mode choice, and a multi-step search algorithm. Results showed that for all metrics studied, the gasoline hybrid-electric (HEV) fleet performed better than EV fleets, while remaining more profitable, providing response times of 4.5 min compared to 5.5 min. The HEV fleet is the more profitable option until the cost of gasoline exceeds $10 per gallon or the cost of a long-range EV falls below $16,000 through subsidies. Of all the EVs studied, the long-range fast-charging scenario not only provides the best service in terms of all metrics studied, but is by far the most profitable. Even though EVs may not be financially advantageous in the near term, the environmental benefits could be substantial; EVs have the potential to provide zero-carbon transportation when coupled with a renewable power grid. Gasoline vehicles have no such potential. Environmentalism tends to have little effect on financial decisions, but a carbon tax could change that perspective.

AB Future underwater vehicles will be increasingly called upon to work in cluttered environments and to interact with their surroundings. These vehicles will need sensors that work efficiently at short range and be highly maneuverable at low speed. To obtain insights into principles and mechanisms of low-speed operation in cluttered environments, we examine a fish that excels in this regime, the black ghost knifefish Apteronotus albifrons. This fish hunts in dark or turbid water using a short-range self-generated electric field to sense its surroundings. Coupled with this unique mode of sensing is an unusual ribbon fin propulsion system that confers high multidirectional maneuverability at low speeds. To better understand the relationship between body morphology and common maneuvers of this fish, we utilized an idealized ellipsoidal body model, Kirchhoff's equations, and an optimal control algorithm for generating trajectories. We present evidence that common fish trajectories are optimal, and that these trajectories complement the sensory abilities of the fish. We also discuss prototypes of the sensing and propulsion systems of the fish with a view to providing alternative approaches for underwater vehicle design where high maneuverability in geometrically complex environments is needed.

AB Exact estimation of longitudinal force and sideslip angle is important for lateral stability and path-following control of four-wheel independent driven electric vehicle. This paper presents an effective method for longitudinal force and sideslip angle estimation by observer iteration and information fusion for four-wheel independent drive electric vehicles. The electric driving wheel model is introduced into the vehicle modeling process and used for longitudinal force estimation, the longitudinal force reconstruction equation is obtained via model decoupling, the a Luenberger observer and high-order sliding mode observer are united for longitudinal force observer design, and the Kalman filter is applied to restrain the influence of noise. Via the estimated longitudinal force, an estimation strategy is then proposed based on observer iteration and information fusion, in which the Luenberger observer is applied to achieve the transcendental estimation utilizing less sensor measurements, the extended Kalman filter is used for a posteriori estimation with higher accuracy, and a fuzzy weight controller is used to enhance the adaptive ability of observer system. Simulations and experiments are carried out, and the effectiveness of proposed estimation method is verified.

AB The shortest loop covering at least one edge of each workcenter in a manufacturing facility layout is an instance of the generalized traveling salesman problem. The optimal solution to this problem is a promising design for non-vehicle-based material handling, typical of most types of conveyors and power and-free systems, where the length of the path is the main driver of the total investment costs. The loop formulation is usually embedded within a larger problem of the concurrent design of the loop and the input/output stations for vehicle-based material handling typical of automatically guided vehicles and autonomous delivery robots. In these systems, it is not the length, but the total flow of the loaded and empty vehicles that drives the objective function. It has been shown that the shortest loop provides an effective heuristic scheme to achieve prosperous and robust solutions for the concurrent design of the loop and input/output stations. We review and compare covering constraints formulations, provide new insight into connectivity constraints, improve the model formulation and its solution procedure, and report computational results.

AB Reliable motion estimation is a key component for autonomous vehicles. We present a visual odometry method for ground vehicles using template matching. The method uses a downward-facing camera perpendicular to the ground and estimates the motion of the vehicle by analyzing the image shift from frame to frame. Specifically, an image region (template) is selected, and using correlation we find the corresponding image region in the next frame. We introduce the use of multitemplate correlation matching and suggest template quality measures for estimating the suitability of a template for the purpose of correlation. Several aspects of the template choice are also presented. Through an extensive analysis, we derive the expected theoretical error rate of our system and show its dependence on the template window size and image noise. We also show how a linear forward prediction filter can be used to limit the search area to significantly increase the computation performance. Using a single camera and assuming an Ackerman-steering model, the method has been implemented successfully on a large industrial forklift and a 4x4 vehicle. Over 6 km of field trials from our industrial test site, an off-road area and an urban environment are presented illustrating the applicability of the method as an independent sensor for large vehicle motion estimation at practical velocities.

TI Towards a Trajectory Planning Concept: Augmenting Path Planning Methods

SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & ROBOTIC SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE Trajectory planning; Path planning; A*; Theta*; Speed limit constraints
ID ALGORITHM
AB Trajectory planning is an essential part of systems controlling autonomous entities such as vehicles or robots. It requires not only finding spatial curves but also that dynamic properties of the vehicles (such as speed limits for certain maneuvers) must be followed. In this paper, we present an approach for augmenting existing path planning methods to support basic dynamic constraints, concretely speed limit constraints. We apply this approach to the well known A* and state-of-the-art Theta* and Lazy Theta* path planning algorithms. We use a concept of trajectory planning based on a modular architecture in which spatial and dynamic parts can be easily implemented. This concept allows dynamic aspects to be processed during planning. Existing systems based on a similar concept usually add dynamics (velocity) into spatial curves in a post-processing step which might be inappropriate when the curves do not follow the dynamics. Many existing trajectory planning approaches, especially in mobile robotics, encode dynamic aspects directly in the representation (e.g. in the form of regular lattices) which requires a precise knowledge of the environmental and dynamic properties of particular autonomous entities making designing and implementing such trajectory planning approaches quite difficult. The concept of trajectory planning we implemented might not be as precise but the modular architecture makes the design and implementation easier because we can use (modified) well known path planning methods and define models of dynamics of autonomous entities separately. This seems to be appropriate for simulations used in feasibility studies for some complex autonomous systems or in computer games etc. Our basic implementation of the augmented A*, Theta* and Lazy Theta* algorithms is also experimentally evaluated. We compare (i) the augmented and basic A*, Theta* and Lazy Theta* algorithms and (ii) optimizing of augmented Theta* and Lazy Theta* for distance (the trajectory length) and duration (time needed to move through the trajectory).

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; CONTROL STRATEGY; LATERAL CONTROL; DRIVER; DESIGN
AB Commercial vehicles generally drive at a higher speed on structured expressways, and their higher center of mass leads to a lower rollover threshold and a greater rollover risk while steering. Therefore, the design of a lateral trajectory-tracking control strategy for commercial vehicles should not only consider the accuracy of trajectory tracking but also consider roll stability. Based on this control objective, a fuzzy linear quadratic controller was designed in this study to ensure rolling stability in the path-tracking control process and improve the adaptability of the strategy to the driving scenario. Firstly, a steering and braking cooperative control model based on the four-degree-of-freedom model and the multi-point preview model was established. Then, a path tracking controller considering roll stability was designed based on the linear quadratic theory. On this basis, a fuzzy linear quadratic controller was designed to realize the online optimization of cost function weights. Finally, the effectiveness of the control strategy was verified using co-simulation and hardware-in-loop experiments. The results show that the designed controller can effectively adjust the weight of path-tracking and stability according to the vehicle's state. This effectively improves the vehicle's control distribution problem.

ID OBJECT DETECTION
AB 3D vehicle detectors based on point clouds generally have higher detection performance than detectors based on multi-sensors. However, with the lack of texture information, point-based methods get many missing detection of occluded and distant vehicles, and false detection with high-confidence of similarly shaped objects, which is a potential threat to traffic safety. Therefore, in the long run, fusion-based methods have more potential. This paper presents a multi-level fusion network for 3D vehicle detection from point clouds and images. The fusion network includes three stages: data-level fusion of point clouds and images, feature-level fusion of voxel and Bird's Eye View (BEV) in the point cloud branch, and feature-level fusion of point clouds and images. Besides, a novel coarse-fine detection header is proposed, which simulates the two-stage detectors, generating coarse proposals on the encoder, and refining them on the decoder. Extensive experiments show that the proposed network has better detection performance on occluded and distant vehicles, and reduces the false detection of similarly shaped objects, proving its superiority over some state-of-the-art detectors on the challenging KITTI benchmark. Ablation studies have also demonstrated the effectiveness of each designed module.

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

ID PROPAGATION WAVE; CONTROL STRATEGY; VALIDATION; DESIGN; CACC
AB Vehicle-to-vehicle communications can be unreliable because of interference and information congestion, which leads to the dynamic information flow topology (IFT) in a platoon of connected and autonomous vehicles. Some existing studies adaptively switch the controller of cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) to optimize string stability when IFT varies. However, the difference of transient response between controllers can induce uncomfortable jerks at switching instances, significantly affecting riding comfort and jeopardizing vehicle powertrain. To improve riding comfort while maintaining string stability, the authors introduce a smooth-switching control-based CACC scheme with IFT optimization (CACC-SOIFT) by implementing a bi-layer optimization model and a Kalman predictor. The first optimization layer balances the probability of communication failure and control performance optimally, generating a robust IFT to reduce controller switching. The second optimization layer adjusts the controller parameters to minimize tracking error and the undesired jerk. Further, a Kalman predictor is applied to predict vehicle acceleration if communication failures occur. It is also used to estimate the states of preceding vehicles to suppress the measurement noise and the acceleration disturbance. The effectiveness of the proposed CACC-SOIFT is validated through numerical experiments based on NGSIM field data. Results indicate that the CACC-SOIFT framework can guarantee string stability and riding comfort in the environment of dynamic IFT.

AB We propose a novel algorithm to identify occupied seats in a motor vehicle, i.e., the number of occupants and their positions, using a frequency modulated continuous wave radar. Instead of using a high-resolution radar, which increases the cost and device size, and performing complex signal processing with several variables to be tuned for each scenario, we integrate machine learning algorithms with a low-cost radar system. Based on heat maps obtained from the Capon beamformer, we train a machine classifier to predict the number of occupants and their positions in a vehicle. We follow two different classification methods: multiclass classification and binary classification. We compare three classifiers: support vector machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest (RF), in terms of accuracy and computational complexity for both testing and training sets. Our proposed system using an SVM classifier achieved an overall accuracy of 97% in classifying the defined scenarios in both multiclass classification and binary classification methods. In addition, to show the effectiveness of our proposed in-vehicle occupancy detection method, we provide the results of a commonly available people counting and tracking method for occupancy detection. Compared to common methods, the effectiveness, robustness, and accuracy of our proposed in-vehicle occupancy detection method are demonstrated.

AB This paper presents the results of the design, simulation, and implementation of a virtual vehicle. Such a process employs the Unity videogame platform and its Machine Learning-Agents library. The virtual vehicle is implemented in Unity considering mechanisms that represent accurately the dynamics of a real automobile, such as motor torque curve, suspension system, differential, and anti-roll bar, among others. Intelligent agents are designed and implemented to drive the virtual automobile, and they are trained using imitation or reinforcement. In the former method, learning by imitation, a human expert interacts with an intelligent agent through a control interface that simulates a real vehicle; in this way, the human expert receives motion signals and has stereoscopic vision, among other capabilities. In learning by reinforcement, a reward function that stimulates the intelligent agent to exert a soft control over the virtual automobile is designed. In the training stage, the intelligent agents are introduced into a scenario that simulates a four-lane highway. In the test stage, instead, they are located in unknown roads created based on random spline curves. Finally, graphs of the telemetric variables are presented, which are obtained from the automobile dynamics when the vehicle is controlled by the intelligent agents and their human counterpart, both in the training and the test track.

AB In this study, we conducted vehicle experiments and a numerical simulation based on a simple algorithm inspired by the bio-sonar system of bats to investigate how the behavioral strategy employed by bats contributes to acoustic navigation for minimal-design sensing. In particular, a double-pulse scanning method inspired from the echolocation behavior of bats was proposed, in which (1) the direction of ultrasound emission by a vehicle equipped with 1 transmitter and 2 receivers was alternately shifted between the movement direction of the vehicle and the direction of the nearest obstacle, and (2) the movement direction of the vehicle was calculated for every double-pulse emission based on integrated information from all echoes detected. As a result of 100 repeated drives in a practical course, the success rate of an obstacle-avoidance drive improved from 13% with the conventional single-pulse scanning method to 73% with the proposed method. Furthermore, the numerical simulation demonstrated that the proposed method achieves robust path planning by suppressing the localization ambiguity due to the interference of multiple echoes. The practical experiments and numerical simulation suggest that bats employ a simple behavioral solution in the operation of acoustic sensing for various problems occurring in the real world.

DE collateral anomaly; collateral position; driving behaviour; lateral

ID MODEL; SIMULATION
AB The lateral direction of traffic, introduced into modelling during the last decade, is a matter of growing interest. If properly developed, 2D traffic models may allow more accurate reproduction of traffic, thus enhancing the effectiveness and application field of traffic simulation, as well as the understanding of driver behaviour. A more complete knowledge of human driving, in turn, is an important requirement for human-friendly autonomous vehicles sharing streets with human drivers. This paper addresses a tendency of drivers we call collateral anomaly (CA), by which they tend to choose different lateral positions depending on whether they are accompanied side by side by another vehicle or not. Although intuitive, it has never been measured before. In this work we characterise it by statistical means starting from three real trajectory datasets belonging to the Next-Generation Simulation project. We found evidence that the lateral position of vehicles follows a slightly different distribution when they have another vehicle vis-a-vis, deviating from the expected distribution by more than 50 mm on average. The effect is correlated to but cannot be explained alone by lane-changes, and seems to increase with speed. This kind of measure is a necessary step towards analysing 2D traffic model performance. Understanding CA might help understand other lateral position-related phenomena, like the relaxation phenomenon, or the influence of lane and vehicle width in traffic.

AB Parameter calibration is critical for self-localization based on dead reckoning in the control of intelligent vehicles such as autonomous driving. Most traditional calibration methods for robotics control based on dead reckoning rely on data collection with specially designed paths. For the calibration of parameters in the control of intelligent vehicles, the design of such paths is considered impossible due to the complexity of road conditions. To solve this problem, an optimization-based dead reckoning calibration scheme is introduced in this research using the differential global positioning system to obtain the actual positions of the intelligent vehicle. In this scheme, the difference between the positions obtained through dead reckoning and the positions obtained through the differential global positioning system is selected as the optimization objective function to be minimized. An adaptive quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm is developed to improve the quality and efficiency of optimization. Experiments with an intelligent vehicle were also conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed calibration scheme. In addition, the newly introduced adaptive quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm is compared with the classic genetic algorithm and the classic quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm using eight benchmark test functions considering computation quality and efficiency.

SO CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE

DT Article
DE Optimal control; Autonomous vehicles; Fuel economy; Cruise control
AB Controlling the longitudinal movement of heavy-duty vehicles based on optimal control can be a cost-efficient way of reducing their fuel consumption. Such controllers today mainly exist for highway driving, in which the velocity is allowed to deviate from a constant set-speed. For vehicles with varying velocity demands, for instance vehicles in distribution and mining applications, such controllers do not exist to the same extent. This paper describes an implementation of, and experiments with, an optimal controller in a real heavy-duty vehicle. The velocity profile of the driving cycle varies due to curvature and varying legal speed limits. These limitations are used together with road slope, actuator limitations, and driveability considerations as constraints in the optimal control problem. The problem is solved offline as a mixed integer quadratic program, which generates trajectories for the velocity and for freewheeling. These are used as reference for the existing cruise control functions in experiments in a Scania truck. Results in terms of fuel consumption and trip time are compared with a benchmark controller that mainly follows a fixed fraction of the maximum possible velocity. Solving the optimal control problem results in 18% reduction of the fuel consumption and 1% reduction of the trip time. Experiments with fuel measurements results in 16% reduction of the fuel consumption and 1% reduction of the trip time.

AB Automated driving, which is considered to be able to reduce driving workload, enhance driving safety and improve traffic efficiency, has become a research hotspot in recent years. It is believed that traffic flow will consist of manual vehicles and automated vehicles at different automation levels in the near future. Researchers have carried out many studies on mixed traffic; most of them focus on the highway scenario. However, the majority of traffic occurs in urban/suburban road networks, which contains many different scenarios, such as expressways, merging/diverging areas, signalised intersections, trunk roads, branch roads, etc. To evaluate the effect of automated driving in a more realistic way, the authors first take adaptive cruise control (ACC) and cooperative ACC as representatives of automated driving. Then, the authors make simulations at the road network level and investigate macroscopic fundamental diagram in different scenarios. Results show that compared to a highway, the improvement of traffic flow is significantly limited in the road network.

AB Research on willingness to pay (WTP) can provide practical insights for assessing the value of self-driving vehicle (SDV) technology in the vehicle market. Are people willing to pay extra for the technology? What demographic and psychological factors can influence people's WTP for this technology? These questions are not yet well investigated. We conducted surveys in two cities in China (total N = 1355) and examined WTP and its potential demographic determinants (familiarity, age, gender, education, and income) and psychological determinants (perceived benefit and risk of SDVs, anticipated perceived dread riding in SDVs, and trust in SDVs). About 26.3% of participants were unwilling to pay extra, 39.3% were willing to pay less than $2900, and the remaining 34.3% were willing to pay more than $2900. Younger and highly educated participants with higher-income were willing to pay more. Participants who had heard about SDVs before the survey reported higher WTP and higher trust and perceived higher benefits, lower risks, and lower dread. Trust and perceived benefit were positive predictors of WTP and perceived risk and perceived dread were negative predictors of WTP. Our results may offer practical implications for increasing the public's acceptance and WTP of SDVs.

AB Connected vehicles (CVs) and their supporting infrastructure are expected to play an important role in the management of traffic congestion. As highway expansion projects are becoming less common, deploying emerging technologies is essential to make the most of the current road infrastructure. Most published studies report that CVs improve traffic performance only marginally. Here, we propose that CVs drive cooperatively with cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC)-enabled vehicles by designating a CACC lane for periods with high flows of slow-moving heavy-duty drayage trucks. To assess if this approach could help absorb year 2035 projected drayage traffic increases at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which is the largest port complex in the U.S.A., we analyze three 2035 scenarios for I-710, a key freeway for freight transportation in Southern California: (1) CACC-enabled vehicles are deployed under mixed traffic conditions; (2) CACC-enabled vehicles are restricted to the first lane (left-most lane); (3) the first lane is reserved for CACC-enabled vehicles, and access is optional. Our results suggest that substantial speed improvements can be obtained, but only when the first lane is CACC reserved with optional access, because this approach creates more platooning opportunities and thus helps maximize the benefits of CACC.

AB For marine industrial inspection, archaeology, and geological formation study, the ability to map unknown underwater enclosed and confined spaces is desirable and well suited for robotic vehicles. To date, there are few solutions thoroughly tested in the field designed to perform this specific task, none of which operate autonomously. With a small, low-cost biomimetic platform known as the U-CAT, we developed a mapping-mission software architecture in which the vehicle executes three key sensor-based reactive stages: entering, exploring, and exiting. Encapsulated in the exploring stage are several state-defined navigation strategies, called patterns, which were designed and initially tested in simulation. The results of simulation work informed the selection of two patterns that were executed in field trials at a submerged building in Rummu Quarry Lake, Estonia, as part of several full mapping missions. Over the course of these trials, the vehicle was capable of observing the majority (78-97%) of 49.9 explorable square meters within 7 minutes. Based on these results, we demonstrate the capability of a low-cost and resource-constrained vehicle to perform confined space mapping under sensor uncertainty. Further, the observations made by the vehicle are shown to be suitable for a target site reconstruction and analysis in post-processing, which is the intended outcome of this type of mission in practical applications.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology is expected to increase road capacity and reduce fuel consumption, but it may take time for all human-driven vehicles (HVs) to be replaced by CAVs. During the transition period, CAVs and HVs will continue to coexist. This paper aims to find an optimal deployment of a CAV platoonable corridor to facilitate CAV platooning and better manage traffic congestion on road networks with a mixed traffic flow of CAVs and HVs. Generally, dedicated infrastructure for CAVs, such as CAV lanes, zones, or corridors, may have distributional welfare effects on travelers. Especially, HV users may be worse off because road space is partially converted to dedicated infrastructure for CAVs. To facilitate equitable infrastructure planning, we develop a bi-level program for a Stackelberg game that incorporates the equity concern, where the planner acts as the leader to determine the optimal deployment of an equitable CAV platoonable corridor at the upper level, while travelers are followers who make user-optimal route choices given the CAV platoonable corridor at the lower level. For the lower-level problem, we model the decision-making of travelers as a platoon-embedded network equilibrium with mixed flow (PNEMF) and derive its equivalent variational inequality (VI) problem. The existence and the uniqueness of the VI solution are proved. To solve the bi-level program efficiently, we propose a simulated-annealing-based corridor search (SACS) algorithm. Our numerical experiments on the Nguyen-Dupuis (ND), Sioux Falls (SF), Anaheim, and Winnipeg networks demonstrate the expected benefits of deploying a CAV platoonable corridor if the CAV market penetration ratio exceeds a certain threshold. In the meantime, both CAV and HV users are better off with the deployed equitable corridor. In addition, we find that the degree of the transportation planner's concern about the inequity issue has a significant impact on the corridor design when the CAV penetration ratio is low. With less concern about the inequity issue, the CAV platoonable corridor is longer and more HVs experience higher generalized travel costs.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are recently- envisioned to provide a tremendous social impact, while they put forward a much higher requirement for both vehicular communication and computation capacities to process resource-intensive applications. In this paper, we study unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) for a platoon of wireless power transmission (WPT)-enabled vehicles. Our objective is to maximize the system-wide computation capacity under both communication and computation resource constraints. We incorporate the coupled effects of the platooning vehicles and the flying UAV, air-to-ground (A2G) and groundto-air (G2A) communications, onboard computing and energy harvesting into a joint scheduling optimization model of communication and computation resources. To tackle the resulting optimization problem, we propose a successive convex programming method based on a second-order convex approximation, in which feasible search directions are obtained by solving a sequence of quadratic programming subproblems and used to generate feasible points that can approach a local optimum. We also theoretically prove the feasibility and convergence of the proposed method. Moreover, simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method and demonstrate its superior performance over other conventional schemes.

AB This paper addresses the problem of ice-relative underwater robotic vehicle navigation relative to moving or stationary contiguous sea ice. A review of previously-reported under-ice navigation methods is given, as well as motivation for the use of under-ice robotic vehicles with precision navigation capabilities. We then describe our proposed approach, which employs two or more satellite navigation beacons atop the sea ice along with other precision vehicle and ship mounted navigation sensors to estimate vehicle, ice, and ship states by means of an Extended Kalman Filter. A performances sensitivity analysis for a simulated 7.7 km under ice survey is reported. The number and the location of ice deployed satellite beacons, rotational and translational ice velocity, and separation of ship-based acoustic range sensors are varied, and their effects on estimate error and uncertainty are examined. Results suggest that increasing the number and/or separation of ice-deployed satellite beacons reduces estimate uncertainty, whereas increasing separation of ship-based acoustic range sensors has little impact on estimate uncertainty. Decreasing ice velocity is also correlated with reduced estimate uncertainty. Our analysis suggests that the proposed method is feasible and can offer scientifically useful navigation accuracy over a range of operating conditions.

AB This paper addresses the distributed formation tracking control problem for multi-vehicle systems with nonholonomic constraints, by the aid of event-triggered and sampled-data control methods. Two classes of event-triggered communication and control strategies with fixed sampling period are considered. By designing different event conditions, the communications amongst neighbouring vehicles are allowed at each sampling time instant in the first strategy, whereas the control input of each vehicle is updated only when its own or neighbours' event conditions are violated. Furthermore, both communication and control update are allowed only when the events of itself or neighbours are triggered in another strategy. To this end, an unified event-triggered and distributed observer-based controller with globally asymptotic convergence rate is proposed. And corresponding sufficient conditions are derived regarding to two types of event conditions, based on Lyapunov technique, matrix analysis and algebraic graph theory. It is worth noting that the Zeno-behaviour of systems with the presented controllers and event conditions is naturally avoided for all the vehicles due to the advantageous property of sampled-data control. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.

AB Cellular vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is expected to herald the age of autonomous vehicles in the coming years. With the integration of blockchain in such networks, information of all granularity levels, from complete blocks to individual transactions, would be accessible to vehicles at any time. Specifically, the blockchain technology is expected to improve the security, immutability, and decentralization of cellular V2X communication through smart contract and distributed ledgers. Although blockchain-based cellular V2X networks hold promise, many challenges need to be addressed to enable the future interoperability and accessibility of such large-scale platforms. One such challenge is the offloading of mining tasks in cellular V2X networks. While transportation authorities may try to balance the network mining load, the vehicles may select the nearest mining clusters to offload a task. This may cause congestion and disproportionate use of vehicular network resources. To address this issue, we propose a game-theoretic approach for balancing the load at mining clusters while maintaining fairness among offloading vehicles. Keeping in mind the low-latency requirements of vehicles, we consider a finite channel blocklength transmission which is more practical compared to the use of infinite blocklength codes. The simulation results obtained with our proposed offloading framework show improved performance over the conventional nearest mining cluster selection technique.

AB With the development of autonomous driving, the surging demand for data communications as well as computation offloading from connected and automated vehicles can be expected in the foreseeable future. With the limited capacity of both communication and computing, how to efficiently schedule the usage of resources in the network toward best utilization represents a fundamental research issue. In this article, we address the issue by jointly considering the communication and computation resources for data scheduling. Specifically, we investigate on the vehicular edge computing (VEC) in which edge computingenabled roadside unit (RSU) is deployed along the road to provide data bandwidth and computation offloading to vehicles. In addition, vehicles can collaborate among each other with data relays and collaborative computing via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. A unified framework with communication, computation, caching, and collaborative computing is then formulated, and a collaborative data scheduling scheme to minimize the system-wide data processing cost with ensured delay constraints of applications is developed. To derive the optimal strategy for data scheduling, we further model the data scheduling as a deep reinforcement learning problem which is solved by an enhanced deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm with a separate target Q-network. Using extensive simulations, we validate the effectiveness of the proposal.

AB In this paper, we propose a mission aware motion planning (MAP) framework for a swarm of autonomous unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) or mobile stations in an uncertain environment for efficient supply of resources/services to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) performing a specific mission. The MAP framework consists of two levels, namely, centralized mission planning and decentralized motion planning. On the first level, the centralized mission planning algorithm estimates the density of UAV in a given environment for determining the number of UGVs and their initial operating location. In the subsequent level, a decentralized motion planning algorithm which provides a closed-form expression for velocity command using adaptive density estimation has been proposed. Further, the physical and geographical constraints are integrated into motion planning. A Monte-Carlo simulation is performed to evaluate the advantages of the MAP over distributed stationary stations (DSSs) often used in the literature. The obtained results clearly indicate that in comparison with DSS, MAP reduces the average distance traveled by UAVs about 20%, reduces the loss of mission time by 90 s per interruption and power loss by 3 dB.

AB Information on the spatial distribution of habitats and vulnerable species is important for conservation planning. In particular, detailed knowledge on connectivity of marine ecosystems in relation to depth and seafloor characteristics is crucial for any proposed conservation and management actions. Yet, the bulk of the seafloor remains under-sampled, unstudied and unmapped, thereby limiting our understanding of connections between shallow and deep-water communities. Recent studies on mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) have highlighted the Western Indian Ocean as a particularly understudied marine region. Here we utilise an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to collect in-situ temperature, oxygen concentration, bathymetry, acoustic backscatter and photographic data on benthic communities from shallow (<30 m) and mesophotic (30-150 m) depths at selected sites in the Greater Pemba Channel, Tanzania. Further, we use generalised additive models (GAMs) to determine useful predictors of substratum (hard and sand) and benthic community type (coral, turf algae, fleshy algae, fish). Our results revealed the presence of a complex seafloor characterised by pockmarks, steep slopes, submarine walls, and large boulders. Photographs confirmed the presence of MCE composed of corals, algae and fishes on the eastern margins of the Pemba Channel. The GAMs on the presence and absence of benthic community explained 35%-91% of the deviance in fish and fleshy algae assemblages, respectively. Key predictors of the distribution of hard substrata and the coral reef communities were depth, showing the upper boundary of MCEs present at 30-40 m, and seafloor slope that showed more occurrences on steep slopes. The upper 100 m of water column had stable temperatures (25-26 degrees C) and oxygen concentrations (220-235 mu mol/l). We noted the presence of submarine walls, steeply inclined bedrock, which appeared to support a highly bio-diverse community that may be worthy of particular conservation measures. Our results also highlight the capability of using marine robotics, particularly autonomous vehicles, to fill the knowledge gap for areas not readily accessible by divers or with surface vessels, and their potential application for the initial survey and subsequent monitoring of Marine Protected Areas.

AB Numerous interaction demands for smart cities have arisen due to the explosive growth of the Internet of Things and mobile communication. Due to its passive low energy consumption and affordable deployment cost, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a potential key technology to develop a novel paradigm of wireless communication at unsignalized intersections. This article studies the signal interaction between multiple vehicle platoons in different paths before entering an unsignalized intersection supported by unmanned aerial vehicle, which is usually difficult to solve without the assistance of communication. Under the limitation of calculation and transmission resources, the objective is to optimize the system's transmission efficiency. The joint resource scheduling model of communication time and transmission power includes the coupling effects of vehicle dynamics, onboard computing, signal transmission and reflection, and energy consumption. A method based on the quasi-Newton and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm is designed to carry out optimization iteration. Finally, the simulation results show that this method is generally efficient and outperforms the benchmark methods.

AB A vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) is an autonomous system of mobile vehicles created on-demand where vehicles can send or receive data packets over wireless links. In VANET, vehicles have limited communication range R and can communicate directly with neighbor vehicles. Vehicles are equipped with the short communication range dedicated communicative device, global positioning system and other computing devices. Links among vehicles break frequently due to the highly movable nature and limited communication range which turns into data delivery failure. To overcome data delivery failure in multi-hop routing, a novel routing model namely fuzzy logic-based multi-hop directional location routing (FLMDLR) in the vehicular ad-hoc networks has been developed. Using the concept of fuzzy logic, FLMDLR selects remarkable next-hops which help to establish a stable route from the source S to destination node D. Research work done in this paper has shown fuzzy logic applications are more useful to deliver data packets from node S to D. FLMDLR has simulated through network simulator-2 to evaluate performance in term of the link duration, next- hop distance, average number of next-hops, and one hop delay. Through simulated result has shown the proposed model FLMDLR perform better as compared to existing directional-location aided routing (D-LAR) and location aided routing (LAR) protocols.

AB The macroscopic traffic flow model is the cornerstone of traffic flow theory and can be applied to investigate manytraffic planning and management issues. However, the macroscopic model of the heterogeneous traffic flow has not been profoundly studied. This paper developed a novel macroscopic model of the heterogeneous traffic flow under a partly connected and automated environment based on the safety potential field (SPF) theory. The SPF model was applied to describe the microscopic driving behaviour of traditional human-driven vehicles (HVs) and connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). A fundamental diagram (FD) model was derived according to the correlation with the microscopic car-following model under a steady-state condition. To verify the correlation between the FD and the microscopic simulation results, a Monte-Carlo-simulation was also performed. Finally, the macroscopic model of the heterogeneous traffic flow was validated through a simulation on a road section with a bottleneck under different CAVs market penetration rates ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. The results indicate that introducing the CAVs into the pure traffic flow of HVs may slightly have a negligible impact on road capacity when the CAVs penetration rate at a lower level, but the impact increases significantly as the CAVs penetration rate increased.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Autonomous surface vehicles (ASV) allow the investigation of coastal areas, ports, and harbors as well as harsh and dangerous environments such as the arctic regions. In the past decade, several studies addressed the shape optimization, control and stability, and seakeeping of ASVs. Nevertheless, the hydrodynamic analysis of ASV performance subject to variable operational parameters lacks a thorough investigation. In this context, this paper presents a multi-fidelity (MF) hydrodynamic analysis of a catamaran ASV, namely the shallow water autonomous multipurpose platform (SWAMP), at surveying speed in calm water and subject to variable payload and location of the center of mass, accounting for the variety of equipment that the vehicle can carry. The analysis is conducted in deep water, which is the condition mostly encountered by the ASV during surveys of coastal and harbor areas. The objective of the analysis is the investigation of the effects of the payload and its arrangement on the variations of the resistance, the vehicle attitude, and the wave generated in the region between the catamaran hulls. These are assessed using an unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equation (URANSE) code and a linear potential flow (PF) solver. The latter also includes variable grid refinement and coupling between hydrodynamic loads and rigid body equations of motion. Furthermore, the limitation of a PF analysis in the current context is investigated. Finally, a multi-fidelity Gaussian process (MF-GP) model is obtained combining high-(URANSE) and low-fidelity (PF) solutions following an additive correction approach of the latter. The MF-GP model is iteratively refined using an active learning approach based on the maximum prediction uncertainty and the computational cost of the numerical simulations. Numerical results show that the MF-GP is effective in producing response surfaces of the SWAMP performance with a limited computational cost. It is highlighted how the SWAMP performance is significantly affected not only by the payload, but also by the location of the center of mass. The latter can be therefore properly calibrated to minimize the resistance and allow for longer-range operations.

AB Visible light communication (VLC) is a data transmission technology that uses the LED lighting infrastructure to simultaneously illuminate and communicate. The ubiquitous existence of LED lamps opened a new opportunity for addressing VLC in many indoor communication scenarios. The motivation for the presented application is the efficient management of warehouses supported by autonomous navigation robots that grab goods and deliver them at the packaging station. This functionality demands bidirectional communication between infrastructures and vehicles. We propose links for infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) to perform indoors, bidirectional communication. A bidirectional communication system between a static infrastructure and a mobile robot (I2V) is proposed. The LED lamps of the warehouse illumination system are used to lighten the space and to transmit information on position and racks' contents. The mobile robots communicate with the infrastructure (V2I) to transmit information on the items that are being removed and carried to the packaging station. The communication among robots (V2V) provides information on the number of items intended to be collected when the vehicles are in the same lane. The proposed coding schemes are used as modulation for the ON-OFF keying method. Trichromatic white LEDs and a photodetector based on a-SiC:H/a-Si:H with selective spectral sensitivity are used at the emitter and receiver. Position information is provided by each LED lamp to the vehicle by adequate modulation of the RGB emitters. The decoding strategy is based on accurate calibration of the output signal. Different scenarios were designed and tested. Requirements related to synchronous transmission and flickering were addressed to enhance the system performance. The decoding task is discussed using a bit parity error control methodology to ensure simultaneous detection and correction of bit errors. The consequent increase of bit error rate in the VLC transmission is discussed in the I2V link. (c) 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

AB This paper describes a method that uses memory to determine a,priority ranking for competing hypotheses. The aim is to increase the reasoning efficiency of a system the author calls reasoning to anticipate the future (RAF), which controls automatic guided vehicles (AGVs) in autonomous decentralized flexible manufacturing systems (AD-FMSs). The system includes memory data of past production conditions and AGV actions. Using these memory data, the system reorders hypotheses by giving the highest priority ranking to the hypothesis that is most likely to be true. The system was applied to an AD-FMS that was constructed on a computer. The results showed that, compared with conventional reasoning, this reasoning system reduced the number of hypothesis replacements until a true hypothesis was reached.

AB We present a system for behavior-based control of an autonomous underwater vehicle for the purpose of inspection of coral reefs, a task currently performed by divers holding a video camera while following a rope. Using sonar and vision-based approaches, behaviors have been developed for guiding the robot along its intended course, for maintaining a constant height above the sea floor, and for avoiding obstacles. A task-level controller selects which behaviors should be active according to user-defined plans and in response to system failures. Behavior arbitration has been implemented using both fuzzy logic and utility fusion. Initial experiments have been conducted in a natural coastal inlet, and the system is to be soon demonstrated in the coral reef environment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Countries began to adopt various strategies such as lockdown, mass testing, tracing, quarantine, sanitization, isolation, and treatment to contain COVID-19. However, it was soon realized that we need to take the help of powerful technologies to combat the spread of deadly COVID-19 until a vaccine or a drug is discovered. In this article, we discuss how the use of cutting edge technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Big data, artificial intelligence (AI), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)/drones, blockchain, robotics, autonomous ground vehicles, communication technologies in screening, testing, contact tracing, spread analysis, sanitization, and protocol enforcements can help prevent the COVID-19 spread.

Based on a simpler three-DOF linear dynamic model (DM) of the vehicle, and implemented through a Kalman filter (KF), the performance of the proposed MA-INS is compared to state-of-the-art solutions based on non-linear models. The model allows the online estimation of the sea current parameters before and during the navigation mission. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations as well as a statistical significance test are performed using both simulated and real data, demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed model-aided navigation.

DE multi-agent systems; dynamic transport planning and scheduling
AB Nowadays, transport requests of the society are becoming more and more common and important. Computer systems may be a useful tool for transport companies. This paper is aimed at presenting a system which simulates the functioning of a transport company. The theoretical problem, which needs to be solved, is a dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows and capacity constraints (PDPTW). The nature of the problem, its distribution and the possibility of using a lot of autonomous planning modules, predestines to apply a multi-agent approach. Multi-agent approach facilitates the introduction of elements which do not appear in classical PDPTW as company organisation, different strategies of requests acceptation by different vehicles or communication among vehicles.

AB The article presents a model of the process of safe and optimal control of an autonomous surface object in a group of encountered objects. An algorithm for determining the optimal and safe trajectory based on a multi-object game model was proposed, and an algorithm for determining the optimal trajectory was proposed for comparative analysis, not taking into account the maneuverability of other objects. Simulation studies of the algorithms made it possible to assess the optimality of the trajectories for various acceptable object strategies. An analysis of the characteristics of the sensitivity of the safe control-assessed with the risk of collision, both on the inaccuracy of navigation data and on the number of possible strategies of objects, was carried out.

AB International trade is continuously rising, leading to an increase in the flow of goods passing through transportation hubs, including air and sea. In addition, the aging fleet of inland vessels necessitates renewal through the construction of new vessels, presenting opportunities for the adoption of modern transport technologies. Autonomous barges can transport bulk and containerized cargo between the central port of a specific region and smaller satellite ports, enabling the dispersal of goods over a wider area. Equipping autonomous barges with advanced sensors, such as LIDAR, computer vision systems that operate in visible light and thermal infrared, and incorporating advanced path finding and cooperation algorithms may enable them to operate autonomously, subject only to remote supervision. The purpose of this study is to explore the potential of autonomous electric propulsion barges in inland waterway transport. Given the increasing demand for efficient and sustainable transport solutions as a result of various new policies, which have set new ambitious goals in clean transportation, this study aims to develop a proposition of an electric propulsion hybrid drive inland waterway barge, and compare it to a conventional diesel-powered barge. The methodology involves the creation of a simulation model of an inland waterway class IV electric barge, equipped with advanced sensors and autonomous control systems. The barge's navigation is managed through a multi-agent system, with evolutionary algorithms determining a safe passage route. This research also utilizes a proprietary networked ship traffic simulator, based on real inland vessel recorded routes, to conduct the autonomous navigation study. The energy consumption of the barge on a route resulting from the ship traffic simulation is then examined using the mathematical model using the OpenModelica package. As a result of the study, the proposed hybrid propulsion system achieved a 16% reduction in fuel consumption and CO(2 )emissions, while cutting engine operation time by more than 71%. The findings could provide valuable insights into the feasibility and efficiency of autonomous electric propulsion barges, potentially helping future developments in inland waterway transport.

AB The moment we face cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC), driver takeover, that is, drivers actively take over vehicles to avoid unknown risks, is a necessary concern in reality, especially with the distrust or low acceptance of automated driving technology in the early stage of CACC development. However, the impact of driver takeover on traffic flow has not been accurately presented, as researchers only focused on the taken-over vehicle and neglected the external effects on surrounding vehicles. Departing from the literature, this study provides a novel external perspective for the impact analysis of driver takeover under a connected environment, that is, it considers the resulting communication heterogeneity and specifies multi-class conversions in the entire traffic flow. To be specific, we subdivide the dynamic process of driver takeover into 10 vehicle conversions considering vehicle degradation and platoon reorganization, then analyze their contributions to traffic stability, emissions, and fuel consumption. What is also innovative is that two forms of driver takeover are first developed in this study, which is determined by whether drivers continue opening the communication device after the takeover. On this basis, this study indicates that driver takeover has the potential to cause greater heterogeneity of the traffic flow in contrast to that in the literature and proposes theoretical models for the changed traffic flow configuration and traffic stability after the takeover. Finally, numerical experiments verify the theoretical results with discussions on multiple factors, for example, vehicle proportion, platoon length, and driving behaviors. The findings extend the external effects of driver takeover on multi-class vehicle conversions in heterogeneity traffic flow and provide a more realistic basis for the evaluation of driver takeover.

AB This study aims to estimate the severity of conflicts that may arise from the introduction of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) by examining the vehicle paths generated by microsimulations of mixed fleets of human-driven vehicles and CAVs with different levels of automation (L1-L4 vehicles). The study assesses the severity of conflicts using a holistic approach that considers three dimensions: (1) proximity to collision, via the time-to-collision (TTC) indicator; (2) potential consequences of a conflict, via single surrogate safety measures such as maximum speed (MaxS) and vehicle speed difference (DeltaS); and (3) a combination of both dimensions to assign severity scores, via TTC and velocity vectors. The study's findings suggest that moderate penetration rates of L3 and L4 vehicles (35-55%) show significant differences in the number of traffic conflicts with varying TTC values. Additionally, high penetration rates of L3 and L4 vehicles (above 55%) result in lower values of conflict consequences measures such as MaxS and DeltaS. Furthermore, the study shows that conflict consequences decrease if the follower is a L3 or L4 vehicle. The study's findings also reveal that there is a considerable reduction in high severity conflicts when the penetration rate of CAV levels reaches 50%, and the full operation of L4 vehicles results in a 75.5% reduction in high severity conflicts. Therefore, this study provides valuable insight into the potential severe conflicts during the transition period from manual vehicle operation to full CAV operation. Overall, the study's findings highlight the importance of assessing the severity of potential conflicts arising from the introduction of CAVs. By considering the proximity to collision and the potential consequences of conflicts, the study provides a comprehensive assessment of the severity of conflicts. This information can inform the development of policies and strategies to ensure the safe and responsible introduction of CAVs into our transportation systems.

AB Autonomous vehicles usually use more than one positioning system to improve their position estimate. Some positioning systems are advantageous in certain types of environments, while others are more efficient in others. This paper describes a data fusion method, where the differences between measurements are used to identify the type of terrain through which the vehicle is traveling. In this system, position estimate by odometry is compared to that calculated by triangulation, and the differences are fed into a neural network. This neural network, which is pertained by a set of different terrain types, classifies the examined environment by matching it with the most similar environment it can "recognize".

AB This paper presents a driver-specific risk recognition framework for autonomous vehicles that can extract inter-vehicle interactions. This extraction is carried out for urban driving scenarios in a driver-cognitive manner to improve the recognition accuracy of risky scenes. First, clustering analysis is applied to the operation data of drivers for learning the subjective assessment of risky scenes of different drivers and generating the corresponding risk label for each scene. Second, the graph representation model (GRM) is adopted to unify and construct the features of dynamic vehicles, inter-vehicle interactions, and static traffic markings in real driving scenes into graphs. The driver-specific risk label provides ground truth to capture the risk evaluation criteria of different drivers. In addition, the graph model represents multiple features of the driving scenes. Therefore, the proposed framework can learn the risk-evaluating pattern of driving scenes of different drivers and establish driver-specific risk identifiers. Last, the performance of the proposed framework is evaluated via experiments conducted using real-world urban driving datasets collected by multiple drivers. The results show that the risks and their levels in real driving environments can be accurately recognized by the proposed framework.

AB Purpose This paper aims to build an accurate mathematical model which is necessary for control design and attitude estimation of a miniature unmanned rotorcraft and its subsequent conversion to an autonomous vehicle. Design/methodology/approach Frequency-domain system identification of a small-size flybar-less remote controlled helicopter is carried out based on the input-output data collected from flight tests of the instrumented vehicle. A complete six degrees of freedom quasi-steady dynamic model is derived for hover and cruise flight conditions. Findings The veracity of the developed model is ascertained by comparing the predicted model responses to the actual responses from flight experiments and from statistical measures. Dynamic stability analysis of the vehicle is carried out using eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The identified model represents the vehicle dynamics very well in the frequency range of interest. Research limitations/implications The model needs to be augmented with additional terms to represent the high-frequency dynamics of the vehicle. Practical implications Control algorithms developed using the first principles model can be easily reconfigured using the identified model, because the model structure is not altered during identification. Originality/value This paper gives a practical solution for model identification and stability analysis of a small-scale flybar-less helicopter. The estimated model can be easily used in developing control algorithms.

AB Among the huge number of functionalities that are required for autonomous navigation, the most important are localization, mapping, and path planning. In this article, investigation of the path planning problem of unmanned ground vehicle is based on optimal control theory and simultaneous localization and mapping. A new approach of optimal simultaneous localization, mapping, and path planning is proposed. Our approach is mainly affected by vehicle's kinematics and environment constraints. Simultaneous localization, mapping, and path planning algorithm requires two main stages. First, the simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm depends on the robust smooth variable structure filter estimate accurate positions of the unmanned ground vehicle. Then, an optimal path is planned using the aforementioned positions. The aim of the simultaneous localization, mapping, and path planning algorithm is to find an optimal path planning using the Shooting and Bellman methods which minimizes the final time of the unmanned ground vehicle path tracking. The simultaneous localization, mapping, and path planning algorithm has been approved in simulation, experiments, and including real data employing the mobile robot Pioneer P3-AT. The obtained results using smooth variable structure filter-simultaneous localization and mapping positions and the Bellman approach show path generation improvements in terms of accuracy, smoothness, and continuity compared to extended Kalman filter-simultaneous localization and mapping positions.

AB Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications are vital for autonomous vehicles to share sensing data about the surrounding environment, particularly in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) areas where the camera and radar systems often perform poorly. However, an insider adversary such as a compromised vehicle can disseminate false sensing data that even a signature scheme cannot counter. Trusting such shared data, the surrounding vehicles may be trapped to react unexpectedly and potentially poses the risk of a fatal crash. In this work, we introduce a prospective cooperative verification scheme to support both the host vehicles and V2X edge applications in validating the truthfulness of sharing data in the fifth-generation (5G) vehicular networks. First, the detection systems at the host vehicle (local detector) and the road-side unit (RSU) (global detector) separately recreate a trajectory of a target vehicle by extracting its status and attributes from the received Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAM). Simultaneously, they also build another trajectory of the vehicle by independently fusing real-time measurement metrics from signal-based positioning. We then perform a Student's t-test to detect any significant differences between the extracted trajectory and the corresponding measured one. Finally, the quantified evidence from the local and global detector tests will be fused through the Dempster-Shafer fusion for the final decision, i.e., whether the target vehicle is trustful. Besides the theoretical analysis of basic limits, we perform extensive evaluations of the work in cases of both sparse and heavy traffic densities. Through the simulation, this work demonstrates its significant effect in terms of detection performance and response time, particularly for detecting Sybil and false data attacks quickly.

DE directional measurement; distributive control; controllers
AB Purpose - In this paper, two omni-directional mobile vehicles are designed and controlled implementing distributed mechatronics controllers. Omnidirectionality is the ability of mobile vehicle to move instantaneously in any direction. It is achieved by implementing Mecanum wheels in one vehicle and conventional wheels in another vehicle. The control requirements for omni-directionality using the two above-mentioned methods are that each wheel must be independently driven, and that all the four wheels must be synchronized in order to achieve the desired motion of each vehicle.
   Design/methodology/approach - Distributed mechatronics controllers implementing Controller Area Network (CAN) modules are used to satisfy the control requirements of the vehicles. In distributed control architectures, failures in other parts of the control system can be compensated by other parts of the system. Three-layered control architecture is implemented for; time-critical tasks, event-based tasks, and task planning. Global variables and broadcast communication is used on CAN bus. Messages are accepted in individual distributed controller modules by subscription.
   Findings - Increase in the number of distributed modules increases the number of CAN bus messages required to achieve smooth working of the vehicles. This requires development of higher layer to manage the messages on the CAN bus.
   Research limitations/implications - The limitation of the research is that analysis of the distributed controllers that were developed is complex, and that there are no universally accepted tool for conducting the analysis. The other limitation is that teh mathematical models of the mobile robot that have been developed need to be verified.
   Practical implications - In the design of omni-directional vehicles, reliability of the vehicle can be improved by modular design of mechanical system and electronic system of the wheel modules and the sensor modules.
   Originality/value - The paper tries to show the advantages of distributed controller for omni-directional vehicles. To the author's knowledge, that is a new concept.

AB Connected vehicles have recently attracted considerable attention for revolutionizing the transportation industry. Although connectivity brings about a vast number of benefits, it can give rise to a wider attack surface as more physical access interfaces have been introduced. In particular, anomalous behaviour of the Electronic Control Units (ECUs) caused by malicious attacks can result in serious consequences and possibly lead to fatal accidents. Hence, it is important to develop methodologies that can sniff vehicular data and detect it for further attack analysis. In this article, we develop a novel similarity-based intrusion detection methodology named SIDuDTW, which identifies malicious messages inside vehicle network, e.g., Controller Area Network (CAN), by using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance between CAN ID sequences. Subsequently, the theoretical analysis for the recurring sequence pattern, wave splitting strategies, similarity metric, and optimal parameters providing strong robustness against several kinds of attacks in SIDuDTW are detailed. A series of experiments demonstrate that the developed methodology can detect attacks with high accuracy. In addition, this proposed methodology significantly outperforms the intrusion detection capabilities of existing approaches in terms of basic injection, replay and suppression attacks. It is envisioned that this work will contribute to the development of safer autonomous vehicle conceptualized as a key unit within broader smart city.

AB Adaptive cruise control, as a driver assistant system for vehicles, can adjust the vehicle speed to keep the appropriate distance from other vehicles, which highly increases the driving safety and driver's comfort. This paper presents hierarchical adaptive cruise control system that could balance the driver's expectation, collision risk, and ride comfort. In the adaptive cruise control structure, there are two controllers to achieve the function. The one is the upper controller which is established based on the model predictive control theory and used to calculate the desirable longitudinal acceleration. The collision risk is described by the Gaussian distribution. A quadratic cost function for model predictive control is formulated based on the potential field method through the contradictions between the tracking error, collision risk, and the longitudinal ride comfort. The other one is the lower optimal torque vectoring controller which is constructed based on the vehicle longitudinal dynamics. And it can generate the desired acceleration considering the anti-wheel slip limitations. Several simulations under different road conditions demonstrate that the proposed adaptive cruise control has significant performance on balancing the tracking ability, collision avoidance, ride comfort, and adhesion utilization. It also maintains vehicle stability for the complex road conditions.

AB When agricultural vehicles operate in the field, the soft road excitation makes it difficult to measure the vehicle vibration. A camera-accelerator system can solve this issue by utilizing computer vision information; however, the relationship between the field road surface and the vehicle vibration response remains an unsolved problem. This study aims to investigate the correlation of the soft road excitation of different long-wave surfaces with the vehicle vibration response. Vibration equation between the vehicle and soft road surface system was established to produce an effective roughness model of the field soft road surface. In order to simulate the vehicle vibration state under different long-wave road surfaces, the soil rectangular pits with 21 kinds of different spans and depths were applied to the road surfaces, and a tractor vibration test system was built for vibration test. The frequency spectrum analysis was performed for the vibration response and the roughness signals of the road surfaces. The results showed that coefficient (R-2) of frequency correlation between the roughness excitation and the original unevenness at the excitation point at the rear end of the rectangular soil pit fell within 0.9641 similar to 0.9969. The main frequency band of the vibration response fell within 0 similar to 3 Hz, and the phenomenon of quadruple frequency existed. The correlation of roughness excitation with quadruple frequency fell within 0.992165 similar to 1. The primary excitation points were located at the rear end of the rectangular soil pit. In addition, it also indicated that when the vehicle was driven without autonomous power, the vehicle vibration frequency mainly depended on the excitation frequency of the field road surface and the frequency at the maximum vehicle vibration intensity was 2 or 3 times of that at the maximum field soft road excitation. These findings may provide a reference for optimal design of vibration reduction and control for agricultural vehicles.

AB Cellular network-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) experience different radio propagation conditions than radio nodes on the ground. Therefore, it has become critical to investigate the performance of aerial radios, both theoretically and through field trials. In this article, we consider low-altitude aerial nodes that are served by an experimental cellular network. We provide a detailed description of the hardware and software components needed to establish a broadband wireless testbed for UAV communications research using software radios. Results show that a testbed for innovation in UAV communications and networking is feasible with commercial off-the-shelf hardware, open source software, and low-power signaling.

AB The beam profile of an antenna can be measured by scanning it over a calibration source in the far field and recording the output power from the antenna as a function of the angle between the direction of the source and antenna axis. For large antennas that do not fit into an anechoic chamber, measurements are often made in a test range where the source is mounted at a large distance and height. However, this method has certain limitations, as constraints on the height of the source make measurements at high altitude angles difficult, and the measurement may also suffer from reflections from the ground.

AB Deep learning is a fast-growing field of research, in particular, for autonomous application. In this study, a deep learning network based on various sensor data is proposed for identifying the roads where the vehicle is driving. Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) unit and ensemble learning are utilized for network design and a feature selection technique is applied such that unnecessary sensor data could be excluded without a loss of performance. Real vehicle experiments were carried out for the learning and verification of the proposed deep learning structure. The classification performance was verified through four different test roads. The proposed network shows the classification accuracy of 94.6% in the test data.

AB The present group previously derived an algebraic general trajectory formula (GTF) for semi-trailer trucks based on six parameters relating to the truck size and truck turning situation. The present study proposes a trajectory planning method based on the GTF which ensures that several arbitrarily-chosen points on the truck pass sequentially through a set of user-defined target points along the required path. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results confirm that the trajectory planning method provides an effective, accurate, and simple methodology for planning the motion path of semi-trailer trucks.

AB Intelligent parking assist systems will soon be available for most vehicles on the market. Many optimal parking trajectories and control strategies have been proposed for reverse parking. However, most of these require intensive computation, causing difficulties in practical use. This paper makes use of a classical path planning method to find the shortest parking path, and establishes the possibility of integrating iterative learning control (ILC) to exploit the capability of learning from experience to track the designed path. The effectiveness of the ILC structure is demonstrated by simulation and experiments. Tracking performance is shown to be much improved by using a simple learning control law.

AB Recent successes in the construction of micro aerial vehicles (< 15 cm) have highlighted the lack of real-time sensors for flight control. This paper describes a low-power real-time visual-horizon sensor for stabilizing the pitch and roll of miniature aircraft in moderate-to-high-altitude flight. This prototype sensor uses a 12 x 12 photoreceptor array to find a best-fit horizon line based on image intensity. The sensor includes a "confidence-level" output for signaling poor sensing conditions and can scan out the image. The chip was fabricated in a commercially available 0.5-mu m CMOS process and operates on less than 2.5 mW with a 5-V power supply.

Micro-UAVs can operate in three-dimensional environments, explore and map multi-story buildings, manipulate and transport objects, and even perform such tasks as assembly. While fixed-base industrial robots were the main focus in the first two decades of robotics, and mobile robots enabled most of the significant advances during the next two decades, it is likely that UAVs, and particularly micro-UAVs, will provide a major impetus for the next phase of education, research, and development.

An underactuated nonlinear H-infinity controller based on the six degrees of freedom dynamic model is designed to control the helicopter attitude and altitude in the inner-loop. The outer-loop control is performed using a model-based predictive controller (MPC) to track the reference trajectory. The robust performance achieved with the proposed control strategy is checked by simulation in the presence of aerodynamic disturbances, unmodelled dynamics and parametric uncertainties.

ID AUTOMOTIVE RADAR; SENSOR
AB As various unmanned autonomous driving technologies such as autonomous vehicles and autonomous driving drones are being developed, research on FMCW radar, a sensor related to these technologies, is actively being conducted. The range resolution, which is a parameter for accurately detecting an object in the FMCW radar system, depends on the modulation bandwidth. Expensive radars have a large modulation bandwidth, use the band above 77 GHz, and are mainly used as in-vehicle radar sensors. However, these high-performance radars have the disadvantage of being expensive and burdensome for use in areas that require precise sensors, such as indoor environment motion detection and autonomous drones. In this paper, the range resolution is improved beyond the limited modulation bandwidth by extending the beat frequency signal in the time domain through the proposed Adaptive Mirror Padding and Phase Correction Padding. The proposed algorithm has similar performance in the existing Zero Padding, Mirror Padding, and Range RMSE, but improved results were confirmed through the rho s indicating the size of the side lobe compared to the main lobe and the accurate detection rate of the OS CFAR. In the case of rho s, it was confirmed that with single targets, Adaptive Mirror Padding was improved by about 3 times and Phase Correct Padding was improved by about 6 times compared to the existing algorithm. The results of the OS CFAR were divided into single targets and multiple targets to confirm the performance. In single targets, Adaptive Mirror Padding improved by about 10% and Phase Correct Padding by about 20% compared to the existing algorithm. In multiple targets, Phase Correct Padding improved by about 20% compared to the existing algorithm. The proposed algorithm was verified through the MATLAB Tool and the actual FMCW radar. As the results were similar in the two experimental environments, it was verified that the algorithm works in real radar as well.

We review 12 laser radar sensors to illustrate the variety of systems that have been applied to robotic applications wherein information extracted from the laser radar data is used to automatically control a mechanism or process. Next we describe selected robotic applications in seven. areas: autonomous vehicle navigation, walking machine foot placement, automated service vehicles, manufacturing and inspection, automotive, military, and agriculture. We conclude with a discussion of the status of laser radar technology and suggest trends we see in the application of laser radar sensors to robotics. Many new applications are expected as the maturity level progresses and system costs are reduced.

AB In this paper, the autonomous trajectory-tracking problem for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based on Sliding Mode Control (SMC) algorithms is treated. The control system is implemented in real-time to stabilize a commercial AR.Drone 2.0 quadrotor using monocular vision. The under-actuated mathematical model is based on the Newton-Euler formulation. The algorithm allows the stabilization of the quadrotor in all its states under the simultaneous effect of parametric uncertainties and constant external disturbances. The vision algorithm uses a monocular camera to estimate the vehicle's position. The experimental test results and numerical simulations show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller.

AB In this work a visual-based autonomous system capable of memorizing and recalling sensory-motor associations is presented. The robot's behaviors are based on learned associations between its sensory inputs and its motor actions. Perception is divided into two stages. The first one is functional: algorithmic procedures extract in real time visual features such as disparity and local orientation from the input images. The second stage is mnemonic: the features produced by the different functional areas are integrated with motor information and memorized or recalled. An efficient memory organization and fast information retrieval enables the robot to learn to navigate and to avoid obstacles without need of an internal metric reconstruction of the external environment.

AB Tire-road friction coefficient is of great significance for vehicle active safety systems, advanced driving assistance systems, and even future autonomous vehicles. Most of the dynamics-based methods for estimating the tire-road friction coefficient neglect the characteristic that the tire stiffness changes with the driving conditions, resulting in a limited number of driving conditions for which the friction coefficient can be effectively estimated. In order to improve the accuracy of the tire-road friction coefficient estimation results, an estimation method is proposed in which the tire stiffness can change adaptively according to the vertical load and the vehicle dynamics response. By analyzing the change in length of the tire-road contact patch, the relationship between vertical load and tire stiffness is established. By adding tire stiffness to the system state, the relationship between tire stiffness and vehicle dynamics response is established. A square-root cubature Kalman filter algorithm with rapid convergence by automatically adjusting the measurement noise covariance matrix is developed to enhance the real-time performance of the estimation method. Finally, the superiority of the method is verified under different test scenarios based on CarSim and MATLAB/Simulink co-simulation platform. The results also show that this method is able to make an accurate identification when tire damage happens.

AB A combined delivery of economic dispatch and frequency regulation (FR) services from electric vehicles (EVs) is proposed to exploit the dynamic flexibility of EV charging load and its revenue opportunities in the electricity markets. The economic feasibility is assessed with the combined operation model of EVs for optimal bidding in the day-ahead energy market and FR market. The proposed optimization adopts the hierarchical control framework with EV aggregator (EVA) as the intermediate control unit to interact with the power system operator. As EVs are paid for FR based on their actual performance, a dynamic control strategy for charging EVs in response to regulation signals is developed to validate the technical feasibility of combined operation. The autonomous control of EVA modulates the charging of each EV to ensure the optimal charging schedules and real-time frequency control. A case study reveals that the profitability of EV charging control can be significantly increased by energy cost reduction and additional regulation revenue. The proposed dynamic control with a novel power-sharing strategy of EVA provides effective frequency support based on the optimal charging schedule and capacity bids without violating charging demand and availability constraints of each individual EV.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Accurate pedestrian crossing intention prediction is critical for autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems. In multi-pedestrian and multi-vehicle interaction scenes, the social interaction between pedestrians and other traffic participants is ubiquitous, which affects pedestrian crossing decisions and the accuracy of prediction. However, previous studies on pedestrian crossing intention lack comprehensive consideration and mathematical modeling of the social interaction. We propose a "social interaction force" (SIF) to identify and quantify social interaction behaviors and combine the hidden Markov model (HMM) to predict pedestrian crossing intentions 1.0 s ahead. Firstly, a large dataset of pedestrian-vehicle interaction samples is collected from two views, and high-dimensional features are extracted for pedestrian intention prediction. Next, the concept of SIF is proposed to quantitatively characterize the influence of other pedestrians and vehicles on pedestrian crossing decisions, including "pedestrian interaction force" and "pedestrian-vehicle interaction force." Finally, SIF, pedestrian features, and road structure features are input into HMM. Sliding time windows are applied to the HMM to achieve dynamic prediction of pedestrian intention sequences. Experimental results show that the recognition accuracy of the proposed model is 0.976, and the accuracy of 1.0 s ahead prediction is 0.932 with guaranteed prediction speed. The proposed model performance is superior to that of the most prevalent models developed thus far.

AB The trajectory planning and control of multi-agent systems requires accurate localization, which may not be possible when GPS signals and fixed features required for SLAM are not available. Cooperative Localization (CL) in multi-agent systems offers a short-term solution that may significantly improve vehicle pose estimation. CL algorithms have been mainly developed and assessed for planar mobile robot networks due to complexities and singularities in three-dimensional (3D) motion. In this paper, we develop the required singularity-free equations and apply and assess an EKF-based CL for 3D vehicle networks. We assess the performance of CL with respect to the number of simultaneous and redundant measurements. We further assess CL performance with only relative position measurements available. Finally, experiments are performed to validate the proposed algorithms. We further investigate the effect of absolute position measurements in CL. Conclusions: Cooperative localization is an effective method when applied to 3D vehicle networks. However, CL does not improve localization with only relative position measurements, and thus previously reported results for 2D vehicle models were only effective due to relative orientation measurements. Absolute measurement reduces the overall localization errors much more significantly when there has been CL with prior relative position measurements.

DT Article
AB Nowadays, vehicle line pressure detection is an important function of an intelligent transportation system. At present, the line pressure detection algorithms mainly include algorithms based on traditional features and models and algorithms based on deep learning. However, these algorithms also have shortcomings such as low detection accuracy or relying on specific scenarios. In this regard, this paper proposes a fast and accurate vehicle line detection algorithm based on deep learning for vehicle images. The algorithm builds a GooleNet-based FCN semantic segmentation network and adds a BN layer, 1 x 1 convolution, and FPN structure to improve the segmentation effect of the GooleNet-FCN network and reduce network parameters. The MobileNet-SSD (no pretrained model) network structure is used for vehicle detection. According to the relationship between the receptive field and the anchor, and then combined with specific data, the prediction branch of the network and the Default Box on the branch are modified and the FPN structure is added for feature fusion to form the final improved MobileNet-SSD network. The experimental results show that the algorithm takes an average time of 67.8 ms per frame, the detection rate of line pressing for a vehicle is 96.6%, and the deep learning models are 25.5 M and 19.2 M, respectively. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and practicality of the detection algorithm proposed in this paper.

AB This paper addresses the development of a modular hardware architecture for the design/construction/operation of a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), based on systems engineering. The Vee model is first presented as a sequential process that emphasizes the validation processes with stakeholders and verification plans in the development and production stages of the ROV's life cycle. The conceptual design process starts with the mapping of user requirements to engineering specifications, using the House of Quality (HoQ), a quality function deployment tool that allows executing a functional-division-based hardware design process that facilitates the integration of components and subsystems, as desired for modular architectures. Then, the functional division and hardware architectures are described, and their connection is made through the proposed system architecture that sets the foundation for the definition of a physical architecture, as it involves flows that connect abstract functions with a real context. Development and production stages are exemplified through the design, construction, and integration of some hardware components needed for the remotely operated vehicle Pionero500, and the operational stage briefly describes the first sea trials conducted for the ROV. Systems engineering has shown to be a very useful tool for the development of marine vehicles and marine engineering projects that require modular architectures.

TI LaneScanNET: A deep-learning approach for simultaneous detection of

AB Autonomous driving is the future of the automotive industry across the globe. Many challenges must be resolved in designing and developing successful Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), especially in developing countries with poor road infrastructure. Detecting obstacles in lanes is essential for robust ADS to decide whether to change lanes, slow down, or even stop. Developing countries like India present challenges, including poor or no lane line demarcation, poor traffic management, and diverse driving behaviors. That brings many challenges to developing robust lane-keeping or lane-changing decision systems in an ADS. Publicly available driving datasets have an inherent bias towards the road infrastructure of developed countries and hence cannot cater to the needs of the Indian requirements. That makes the existing obstacle-lane segment detection models unsuitable for road infrastructures in developing countries. Due to these factors, the rate of advancement of ADS and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) in developing countries is meager compared to other developed countries. This makes it even more critical for future research to focus on these developing countries. This paper proposes a deep-learning-based novel decision-making network named LaneScanNET to assist the ADS in lane-changing or lane-keeping decision-making. The proposed system assists ADS in detecting obstacles, localization of the Ego Vehicle (EGV) on roads, and estimating lane status in its Field of View (FOV). The proposed LaneScanNET uses a parallel pipeline with an Obstacle Detection Network (ODN) and a Lane Detection Network (LDN) to simultaneously process the incoming image frames for detecting obstacles and segmenting lane lines, respectively. Further, the Obstacle-Lane Fusion Network (OLFN) fuses these results to predict the status of the obstacle lane in the FOV of autonomous vehicles. Vellore Institute of Technology's (VIT's) real-time driving dataset on indigenous roads has been collected to train the proposed LaneScanNET with 2464 obstacle-lane images obtained by driving over 60 km. The dataset generated for obstacle detection and its corresponding lane detection has also been made publicly available to promote research work for these developing countries. The proposed system outperforms all existing networks on Indian roads with an accuracy of 75.28% in obstacle detection and 91.36% in lane detection. Additionally, the proposed system can analyze the lane status with an accuracy of 92.54%. The proposed network performs exceptionally well in unforeseen circumstances like shadows, fog, dust, and occlusions making LaneScanNET a robust network that can be an add-on for ADS to make lane-keeping or lanechanging decisions. The LaneScanNET can be integrated into real-time vehicles to assist drivers or ADS.

AB Self-driving or autonomous vehicles require an ability to detect road lanes. In order to do so, a vanishing point should be first detected because the vanishing point exists on the extended lines of road lanes. For detecting the vanishing point, a random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm has been generally utilized. However, the performance of RANSAC is sometimes not so good but fluctuated. Thus, this study proposes a new approach to estimate the vanishing point using a harmony search (HS) algorithm. Results show that HS stably estimates vanishing points with respect to statistics when compared with RANSAC. We hope this model to be utilized in self-driving car in the future.

AB It is widely acknowledged that verifying the safety of autonomous driving strategies requires a substantial body of simulation testing and road testing. In recent years, the formal safety methods represented by Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) have encouraged low-cost autonomous driving safety research, benefitting from its accurate assessment of safety and clear division of responsibilities. However, how to maintain traffic efficiency while ensuring safety remains a challenge. To address this problem, this paper proposes a formulized negotiation-based lane-changing strategy that makes a trade-off between safety and efficiency. Both theoretical analysis and numerical experimental results shows that compared to RSS, our strategy can noticeably improve the success rate of changing lanes on the premise of safety.

AB Advances in low-power instrumentation and communications now often make energy storage the limiting factor for long- term autonomous oceanographic measurements. Recent advances in photovoltaic cells, with efficiencies now close to 30%, make solar power potentially viable even for vehicles such as floats that only surface intermittently. A simple application, the development of a solar-powered Argos recovery beacon, is described here to illustrate the technology. The 65-cm(2) solar array, submersible to at least 750 dbar, powers an Argos beacon. Tests indicate that with minor improvements the beacon will run indefinitely at any latitude equatorward of about 50. Scaling up this design to current operational profiling floats, each profile could easily be powered by a few hours of solar charging, a shorter time than is currently being used for Argos data communications.

TI Adaptive critic anti-slip control of wheeled autonomous robot
SO IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS

DT Article
AB When a wheeled autonomous robot drives with wheel slips, the velocity and posture control becomes difficult. An ideal automatic driving control system should be able to comply with changes in slip conditions so as to optimise the control performance. Using dual heuristic programming and multi-layer perceptron neural networks, an adaptive critic anti-slip control design is developed to achieve this goal. The critic structure enables neural network learning by satisfying the Bellman equation so that the inclination of the action performance can be assessed to improve the control parameters. A slip model of the robot vehicle is derived. The adaptive critic anti-slip control system is verified extensively by computer simulation. The result shows that the performance is significantly better than that of using traditional fuzzy control.

   This paper demonstrates that it is feasible and advantageous to build a mobile robot which can navigate competently in an initially unknown and time-varying obstacle cluttered environment with most of the above advantages of tethered operation but without a physical tether; instead, a virtual tether based on a radio ethernet bridge is used.

AB The autonomous decision-making of a UAV is based on rapid and accurate threat assessment of the target. Accordingly, modeling of threat assessment under the condition of a small data set is studied in this paper. First, the operational scenario of a manned/unmanned aerial vehicle is constructed, and feature selection and data preprocessing are performed. Second, to obtain the structure, a modeling method for threat assessment is proposed based on an improved BIC score. Finally, the obtained model is applied to compute the threat probability using the junction tree algorithm. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper is an available method for threat assessment under the condition of small data sets.

AB This paper presents the theoretical development of a complete navigation problem of an autonomous mobile robot. The situation for which the vehicle tries to reach the endpoint is treated using a fuzzy logic controller. The problem of extracting the optimized IF-THEN rule base is solved using an evolutionary algorithm. A new approach based on fuzzy concepts is presented in this paper to avoid any collision with the surrounding environment when this latter becomes relatively complex. Simulation results show that the designed fuzzy controller achieves effectively any movement control of the vehicle front its current position to its end motion and without any collision.

AB In this study, we constructed a fully autonomous two-wheeled vehicle (the Rider Robot) which was used for evaluation of dynamics. As the first step of the study, we constructed the control algorithms and the control system.
   The control algorithms consist of the standing stability control which keeps the perpendicular motion, and the directional control which follows the target course. These algorithms were determined based on human rider's behavior. The system was constructed using some actuators and sensors.
   The results show that Rider Robot could follow the target course while keeping the standing stability. Consequently, there is considerable validly in these constructed algorithms and the system.

Through early work in real-time simulation with real hardware in the loop at UBM, and through the EUREKA-project 'Prometheus' from 1987 to 1994 following the 100(th) anniversary of road vehicle developments since 1886, Europe has pioneered the field. Since first fully autonomous testdrives in 1986, and first participation in public traffic in 1992, considerable progress has been achieved. With continuous growth in computing power of microprocessors at a rate of about one order of magnitude every four to five years, sufficient performance levels for dynamic machine vision will be available within one or two decades. The principles of dynamic vision as developed at UBM and performance levels achieved are discussed.

AB Autonomous docking can enable AUV to have long endurance, so it is necessary to consider the issue of robust docking control under current and wave disturbances. In this work, based on the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, we developed a model-free docking controller to complete three-dimensional docking tasks under disturbances. To improve the performance of PPO, two mechanisms are proposed, including adaptive rollback clipping and self-generated demonstration replay. A simulation environment is constructed, including fuzzy hydrodynamic parameters, ocean current and wave disturbance model. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method has faster learning speed, higher robustness, and can control AUV to achieve 3D docking tasks in complex environments with a high success rate.

AB We introduced a research framework for the economic impact assessment of smart city investment using a computable general equilibrium model. Smart Columbus, the first smart city initiative funded by the U.S. federal government to improve urban mobility in central Ohio, was adopted as a case study. The analysis shows that smart city investment has varying effects on the local economy during the construction and operational phases. In addition, the results of distributional impacts on household income suggest that social equity should be given more attention in future planning and decision-making on smart city development, both in Columbus and beyond.

AB Recent advances in connected vehicles and autonomous driving are going to change the face of ground transportation as we know it. This paper describes the design and evaluation of several emerging applications for such a cyber transportation system (CTS). These applications have been designed using holistic approaches, which consider the unique roles played by the human drivers, the transportation system, and the communication network. They can improve driver safety and provide on-road infotainment. They can also improve transportation operations and efficiency, thereby benefiting travelers and attracting investment from both government agencies and private businesses to deploy infrastructures and bootstrap the evolutionary process of CTS.

AB Automated, connected, electrified, and shared mobility will be cornerstones of the transportation future. Research to quantify the potential benefits and drawbacks of practice, and to identify barriers to adoption, is the first step in any strategic plan for their adoption. However, uncertainties, complexity, interdependence, and the multidisciplinary nature of emerging transportation technologies make it difficult to organize and identify focused research. The contribution of this work is a cognitive framework to help planners and policymakers organize broad topics, reveal challenges, discover ideas for solutions, quantify potential impacts, and identify implications to guide preparation strategies. The authors provide example cognitive frameworks for connected, automated, and electrified vehicles.

AB Among traffic accidents in the USA, 23% of fatal and 32% of non-fatal incidents occurred at intersections. For driver assistance systems, intersection navigation remains a difficult problem that is critically important to increasing driver safety. In this letter, we examine how to navigate an unsignalized intersection safely under occlusions and faulty perception. We propose a real-time, probabilistic, risk assessment for parallel autonomy control applications for occluded intersection scenarios. The algorithms are implemented on real hardware and are deployed in a variety of turning and merging topologies. We show phenomena that establish go/no-go decisions, augment acceleration through an intersection and encourage nudging behaviors toward intersections.

AB We investigate a system of coupled oscillators on the circle, which arises from a simple model for behavior of large numbers of autonomous vehicles where the acceleration of each vehicle depends on the relative positions and velocities between itself and a set of local neighbors. After describing necessary and sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability, we derive expressions for the phase velocity of propagation of disturbances in velocity through this system. We show that the high frequencies exhibit damping, which implies existence of well-defined signal velocities c (+) > 0 and c (-) < 0 such that low frequency disturbances travel through the flock as f (+)(x - c (+) t) in the direction of increasing agent numbers and f (-)(x - c (-) t) in the other.

The methodology includes: stand-alone sub-module evaluation, including comprehensive simulations and statistical analysis of the system's sub-modules, along with hardware validation; quantitative system evaluation for integrated system performance investigation: and structured qualitative analyses for identifying strengths and weaknesses not readily apparent. The defined performance measures include aspects from both multi-robot and AGV fields. The developed methodology provides a systematic way to model, experiment with, analyze, and compare different AGVS control methods. To demonstrate the methodology, it was applied to evaluate a recently developed decentralized AGVS control method. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Collision avoidance (CA) systems are applicable for most transportation systems ranging from autonomous robots and vehicles to aircraft, cars and ships. A probabilistic framework is presented for designing and analyzing existing CA algorithms proposed in literature, enabling on-line computation of the risk for faulty intervention and consequence of different actions. The approach is based on Monte Carlo techniques, where sampling-resampling methods are used to convert sensor readings with stochastic errors to a Bayesian risk. The concepts are evaluated using a real-time implementation of an automotive collision mitigation system, and results from one demonstrator vehicle are presented. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The deck motion is modeled as the superposition of a fixed number of sinusoidal functions of time, of unknown frequency, amplitude and phase. We design an internal-model-based error-feedback dynamic regulator that is robust with respect to uncertainties on the mechanical parameters that characterize the model and secures global convergence.

AB This study addresses the challenge of motion control in autonomousvehicles through the introduction of a novel profile generation design. Specifically,autonomous vehicles often contend with uncertain factors and physicallimitations within their operational environments, such as abrupt changes inacceleration or intricate parametric motion profiles. To tackle this problem, afiltering technique for motion profile generation is proposed, leveraging ahardware programming language as its foundation. The investigation begins byanalyzing the specific structure of the mobile platform, which includes twoactive side wheels, two passive rear wheels, a high load capacity, and adifferential drive mode. Building upon this theoretical basis, the proposedfiltering technique is introduced to attain smooth motion profiles and optimizetiming. Furthermore, the study suggests the use of FPGA (Field ProgrammableGate Array) acceleration to expedite these computations for swift motionprocessing. To validate the efficacy of the proposed method, both the mobilevehicle and the load are simulated as a one-axis linear ball-screw system withan aluminum ruler. The experimental results unequivocally demonstrate theeffectiveness, feasibility, and applicability of the proposed approach across avariety of industrial solutions.
   The filtering technique to generatemotion profile based on the hardware programming language is introduced. First,the specific structure of mobile platform involves two active side wheels andtwo passive rear wheels. Second, theoretical control using the polynomialfunction is mentioned to provide the concrete basis. Third, Field ProgrammableGate Array-accelerated approach is additionally implemented thesecomputations for rapid motion.image

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) promise to make traffic safer, but their societal integration poses ethical challenges. What behavior of AVs is morally acceptable in critical traffic situations when consequences are only probabilistically known (a situation of risk) or even unknown (a situation of uncertainty)? How do people retrospectively evaluate the behavior of an AV in situations in which a road user has been harmed? We addressed these questions in two empirical studies (N = 1,638) that approximated the real-world conditions under which AVs operate by varying the degree of risk and uncertainty of the situation. In Experiment 1, subjects learned that an AV had to decide between staying in the lane or swerving. Each action could lead to a collision with another road user, with some known or unknown likelihood. Subjects' decision preferences and moral judgments varied considerably with specified probabilities under risk, yet less so under uncertainty. The results suggest that staying in the lane and performing an emergency stop is considered a reasonable default, even when this action does not minimize expected loss. Experiment 2 demonstrated that if an AV collided with another road user, subjects' retrospective evaluations of the default action were also more robust against unwanted outcome and hindsight effects than the alternative swerve maneuver. The findings highlight the importance of investigating moral judgments under risk and uncertainty in order to develop policies that are societally acceptable even under critical conditions.

AB The automotive industry has represented an important sector of industrial development worldwide. With technology growth, vehicles have been equipped with various devices that allow them to perform different functions, increase autonomy level, and give drivers greater confidence and comfort. In this sense, data security is a fundamental feature since access to car functionalities needs to be protected from outsiders, only allowing access to authorized users. It means to guarantee data security through communication buses even when connecting from external devices. Therefore, it is necessary to design new security techniques that increase the confidentiality and improve authentication in new vehicles. Although at first, automotive communication protocols did not include security mechanisms, the risk of threats was always latent. Due to this, the search for new methods and architectures to improve security and autonomous functions in communication protocols has been in constant increase. New paradigms and ways to prevent, detect and mitigate attacks on automotive communication are necessary for the new challenges ahead. This article comparatively analyses the state of the art for in-vehicle communications protocols regarding a variety of algorithmic approaches based on architectural configurations and extensively compares their performance.

AB In this study, we propose and test through micro-simulation a novel controller for the combined control of freeway traffic by adopting coordinated Ramp Metering (RM) and Variable Speed Limiting (VSL) strategies. In order to figure out the performance of the $H_{infinity}$ State Feedback Controller we have designed, field observations on a real freeway segment with four on-ramps and an off-ramp in the city of Istanbul are used to calibrate the Intelligent Driver Model at SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility). Scenarios with varying penetration rates of vehicles with Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) in mixed traffic are simulated through SUMO specific to the cases of no control, only coordinated RM control, and the combined coordinated RM + VSL control. Performance of the controller we have proposed has been analyzed considering a number of measures on traffic flow dynamics and emissions exhausted. We define three critical levels for penetration rates of vehicles with CACC in freeway traffic.

AB Performance in autonomous driven vehicles is susceptible of degradation when traversing different terrains, thus needing motion controllers to be tuned for different terrain profiles. Such tuning stage is a time consuming process for the programmer or operator, and it is often based on intuition or heuristic approaches, and once tuned, the performance of the vehicle varies according to the terrain nature. In this context, we provide a visual based approach to identify terrain variability and its transitions, while observing and learning the performance of the vehicle using machine learning techniques. Based on the identified terrain and the knowledge regarding the performance of the vehicle, our system self-tunes the motion controller, in real time, to enhance its performance. In particular, the trajectory tracking errors are reduced, the control input effort is decreased, and the effects of the wheel-terrain interaction are mitigated preserving the system robustness. The tests were carried out by simulation and experimentation using a robotized commercial platform. Finally, implementation details and results are included in this paper, showing an enhancement in the motion performance up to 92.4% when the highest accuracy of the terrain classifier was 84.3%.

AB DNA transposons are effective chromosomal engineering vehicles for making transgenic zebrafish. We describe both autonomous and non-autonomous transposable elements, and we compare and contrast popular transposon systems. The Tol2 system is a robust gene transfer tool and has been selected as the primary transposon platform, facilitating the development of an array of reagents readily shared within the zebrafish community. We present common transposon and transposase vectors within the field based on the Tol2 system. We describe methods with a high success rate of generating transgenic zebrafish using Tol2 vectors, including key quality control steps during the transgenesis process. Together, these data should enable the ready generation of transgenic zebrafish for scientific inquiry.

AB Many emerging applications of nano-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), with a few cm(2) form-factor, revolve around safely interacting with humans in complex scenarios, for example, monitoring their activities or looking after people needing care. Such sophisticated autonomous functionality must be achieved while dealing with severe constraints in payload, battery, and power budget (similar to 100 mW). In this work, we attack a complex task going from perception to control: to estimate and maintain the nano-UAV's relative 3-D pose with respect to a person while they freely move in the environment-a task that, to the best of our knowledge, has never previously been targeted with fully onboard computation on a nano-sized UAV. Our approach is centered around a novel vision-based deep neural network (DNN), called Frontnet, designed for deployment on top of a parallel ultra-low power (PULP) processor aboard a nano-UAV. We present a vertically integrated approach starting from the DNN model design, training, and dataset augmentation down to 8-bit quantization and deployment in-field. PULP-Frontnet can operate in real-time (up to 135 frame/s), consuming less than 87 mW for processing at peak throughput and down to 0.43 mJ/frame in the most energy-efficient operating point. Field experiments demonstrate a closed-loop top-notch autonomous navigation capability, with a tiny 27-g Crazyflie 2.1 nano-UAV. Compared against an ideal sensing setup, onboard pose inference yields excellent drone behavior in terms of median absolute errors, such as positional (onboard: 41 cm, ideal: 26 cm) and angular (onboard: 3.7 degrees, ideal: 4.1 degrees). We publicly release videos and the source code of our work.

AB Digital technologies are transforming the industrial landscape and disrupting traditional business models. New business opportunities related to Industry 4.0 are emerging, so companies must adapt to the new environment. This work puts forward a multi-objective optimization algorithm to improve productivity and reduce the costs and energy consumption of autonomous industrial processes with the aim of achieving sustainable growth. The processes analyzed encompass an assembly line production with robotic cells and the subsequent material handling systems (MHS) using autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) for indoor transport. An efficient algorithm has been implemented to integrate and minimize industrial robot arm working times, AGVs travel times and their trajectory, and the energy consumed in industrial processes while maximizing global business profits when manufacturing different products in an indoor industrial environment. Furthermore, this is carried out by considering the kinematics and dynamics of autonomous industrial processes and sustainable strategies to ensure compliance with government policies on environmental issues. These objectives are in line with the European Union (EU) guidelines on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, renewable energy share, and improvements in energy efficiency for climate change mitigation and adaptation policies. Based on the difference in energy consumption between optimized and unoptimized industrial processes, the economic benefits can be quantified in terms of GHG emission quotas, volume of fuel consumed, and the indirect benefits with respect to improving corporate brand image. The methodology presented here has been successfully applied to several real case studies covering different manufacturing processes, robotic operations, and products. The results show that higher profits and sustainable growth are achieved when this methodology is used. It helps design Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) and leads to shorter working times and higher energy efficiency and annual profits. In addition, Pareto frontiers show the trade-off between profits and product manufacturing times for different case studies.

AB Intelligent vehicle is an inevitable trend in urban transportation development. Whether for driver assistance systems or advanced driverless systems, safety issues are one of the cores of these systems. This paper proposes a scene safety evaluation method based on binocular camera. By proposing a comprehensive safety evaluation model, the uncertainty of the scene can be represented with a single value, which can be expressed as a quantitative evaluation of the safety of intended functionality (SOTIF). It provides real-time safety monitoring and protection for the driving process of drivers and occupants by the human-computer interaction. Based on the calculation results, different monitoring methods can be adopted for different levels of autonomous driving to further improve the safety of autonomous driving.

AB Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a process to use multiple sensors to position an unmanned mobile vehicle without previous knowledge of the environment, and meanwhile construct a map of this environment for the further applications. Over the past three decades, SLAM has been intensively researched and widely applied in mobile robot control and unmanned vehicle navigation. SLAM technology has demonstrated a great potential in autonomously navigating the mobile robot and simultaneously reconstructing the three-dimensional (3D) information of surrounding environment. With the vigorous driving of sensor technology and 3D reconstruction algorithms, many attempts have been conducted to propose novel systems and algorithms combined with different sensors to solve the SLAM problem. Notably, SLAM has been extended to various aspects of agriculture involved with autonomous navigation, 3D mapping, field monitoring, and intelligent spraying. This paper focuses on the recent developments and applications of SLAM, particularly in complex and unstructured agricultural environment. A detailed summary of the developments of SLAM is given from three main fundamental types: light detection and ranging SLAM, Visual SLAM, and Sensor Fusion SLAM, and we also discuss the applications and prospects of SLAM technology in agricultural mapping, agricultural navigation, and precise automatic agriculture. Particular attention has been paid to the SLAM sensors, systems, and algorithms applied in agricultural tasks. Additionally, the challenges and future trends of SLAM are reported.

AB To develop a bionic maneuverable propulsion system to be applied in a small underwater vehicle, a new conceptual design of the bionic propulsion is applied to the traditional underwater glider. The numerical simulation focuses on the autonomous underwater glider (AUG)'s flapping propulsion at Re = 200 by solving the incompressible viscous Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the immersed boundary method. The systematic analysis of the effect of different motion parameters on the propulsive efficiency of the AUG is carried out, including the hydrofoil's heaving amplitude, the pitching amplitude, the phase lag between heaving and pitching and the flapping frequency. The results obtained in this study can provide some physical insights into the propulsive mechanisms in the flapping-based locomotion.

AB This paper proposes a unique oscillator-based robot controller with learning abilities to effectively guide a team of robots operating in uncertain environments. To verify this, we designed four separate controllers and compared their performance in a series of tests in several different environments. The experiments used a team of three robots to explore arenas with variable lighting and different obstacle patterns, with a goal of having the team as a whole absorb as much light as possible. The four controllers were: a reactive controller, an oscillator with fixed parameters, an oscillator whose parameters changed based on the pattern of sensor information received, and an oscillator-based controller that used reinforcement learning. Experiments confirmed that the proposed method outperforms the others in all environments tested.

AB The capability of perceiving the environment is crucial for advancing the level of autonomy and sophistication of (semi)autonomous robotic systems and determines the complexity of the tasks robotics agents can achieve. This article reviews some techniques as well as challenges shared by many applications which use visual sensing to guide the action of the robotic agent and require coordination between multiple agents. In order to support hierarchical view of such systems sensing both in the context of low-level control as well as planning and coordination between multiple mobile agents will be considered. Several examples of the design and analysis of these hierarchical hybrid systems will be outlined in the context of Intelligent Highways, namely autonomous driving and coordination between multiple vehicles and mobile robot navigation in indoors man made environments.

AB autonomous valet parking (LAVP) is a current trend, partly due to traffic congestion and parking headache. For large-scale parking demands, reservation is introduced to effectively manage valet parking. However, existing schemes focus on parking request verification and parking check in, which aren't applicable to LAVP because they ignore identity legitimacy and communication security in the phase of picking up as well as dropping off passengers. One viable solution is authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocol. Generally, due to low entropy of passwords and dictionary attacks, three-factor (i.e. passwords, biometrics, and smart card) AKA is more secure than single-and two-factor AKA. Unfortunately, known attacks and high overheads hinder the application of three-factor AKA in real-world environments. Hence, one of the most tough tasks is to balance security and availability, especially how to address the potential threats introduced by each factor while taking full advantage of three factors. Inspired by the above challenges, we propose a provably secure three-factor AKA protocol for reservation services in LAVP, namely SecLAVP. Specifically, the passenger and the autonomous vehicle (AV ) complete mutual authentication with the assistance of drop-off/pick-up point (DP ). After successful authentication, the session key is generated between the passenger, DP, and AV for secure communication. In the Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, we formally prove SecLAVP satisfies session-key security. Then, we apply AVISPA to simulate our proposed protocol, to demonstrate that SecLAVP can resist man-in-the-middle attacks. Additionally, informal security analysis indicates that SecLAVP satisfies our defined 16 design goals concerning security. Finally, we evaluate performance of SecLAVP in terms of communication overheads, computational overheads, and scheduling, to manifest the feasibility.

AB The evolution of energy-efficient ultra-low-power (ULP) parallel processors and the diffusion of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are fueling the advent of autonomous driving nano-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These sub-10cm robotic platforms are envisioned as next-generation ubiquitous smart-sensors and unobtrusive robotic-helpers. However, the limited computational/memory resources available aboard nano-UAVs introduce the challenge of minimizing and optimizing vision-based CNNs - which to date require error-prone, labor-intensive iterative development flows. This work explores methodologies and software tools to streamline and automate all the deployment of vision-based CNN navigation on a ULP multicore system-on-chip acting as a mission computer on a Crazyflie 2.1 nano-UAV. We focus on the deployment of PULP-Dronet (Palossi et al., 2019), a state-of-the-art CNN for autonomous navigation of nano-UAVs, from the initial training to the final closed-loop evaluation. Compared to the original hand-crafted CNN, our results show a 2x reduction of memory footprint and a speedup of 1.6x in inference time while guaranteeing the same prediction accuracy and significantly improving the behavior in the field, achieving: i) obstacle avoidance with a peak braking-speed of 1.65 m/s and improving the speed/braking-space ratio of the baseline, free flight in a familiar environment up to 1.96 m/s (0.5 m/s for the baseline), and iii) lane following on a path featuring a 90deg turn - all while using for computation less than 1.6% of the drone's power budget. To foster new applications and future research, we open-source all the software design in a ready-to-run project compatible with the Crazyflie 2.1.

AB Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems can leverage information from sensors to reduce the overhead associated with link configuration. Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) is one sensor widely used in autonomous driving for high resolution mapping and positioning. This letter shows how LIDAR data can be used for line-of-sight detection and to reduce the overhead in mmWave beam-selection. In the proposed distributed architecture, the base station broadcasts its position. The connected vehicle leverages its LIDAR data to suggest a set of beams selected via a deep convolutional neural network.

AB A high assurance on-line recovery technology for a space on-board computer that can be realized using commercial devices is proposed whereby a faulty processor node confirms its normality and then recovers without affecting the other processor nodes in operation. Also, the result of an evaluation test using the breadboard model implementing this technology is reported. Because this technology enables simple and assured recovery of a faulty processor node regardless of its degree of redundancy, it can be applied to various applications, such as a launch vehicle, a satellite, and a reusable launch vehicle. As a result, decreasing the cost of an on-board computer is possible while maintaining its high reliability.

AB This paper addresses the combined problem of trajectory planning and tracking control for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) on the horizontal plane. Given a smooth, inertial, 2D reference trajectory, the planning algorithm uses vehicle dynamics to compute the reference orientation and body-fixed velocities. Using these, the error dynamics are obtained. These are stabilized using backstepping techniques, forcing the tracking error to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero. Simulation results for a constant velocity trajectory, i.e. a circle, and a time-varying velocity one, i.e. a sinusoidal path, are presented. The parametric robustness is considered and it is shown that tracking remains satisfactory. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Lane detection plays a vital part in autonomous driving. Conventional studies rely on less robust hand-craft features, while deep learning has improved the performance of lane detection to a great extent. Different from dominant methods based on semantic segmentation, this paper proposes an end-to-end framework named DevNet, which combines deviation awareness with semantic features based on point estimation. It consists of two modules to capture more representative features by integrating information of distance deviation and angle which helps to tackle diverse driving conditions in real environments, such as dim or shiny light conditions, crowdedness, and vanishing lanes. Experiments on public datasets indicate that the proposed method achieves favorable performance when compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

SO JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS

DT Article
AB This paper presents a flight control approach based on a state-dependent Riccati equation and its application to autonomous helicopters. For our experiments, we used two different platforms: an XCell-90 small hobby helicopter and a larger vehicle based on the Yamaha R-Max. The control design uses a six-degree-of-freedom nonlinear dynamic model that is manipulated into a pseudolinear form where system matrices are given explicitly as a function of the current state. A standard Riccati equation is then solved numerically at each step of a 50 Hz control loop to design the nonlinear state feedback control law online. In addition, the state-dependent Riccati equation control is augmented with a nonlinear compensator that addresses issues with the mismatch between the original nonlinear dynamics and its pseudolinear transformation.

AB This paper proposed a modified artificial physics (AP) method to solve the autonomous navigation problem for mobile robots in complex environments. The basic AP method tends to cause oscillations in the presence of obstacles and in narrow passages, which can result in time consumption. To alleviate oscillation, we modified the AP method using the Levenbery-Marquardt (LM) algorithm. In the modified AP method, we altered the original directions of AP forces to the Newton direction, and adjust the parameter by the LM algorithm. A series of comparative experimental results show that the modified AP method can achieve smoother trajectories with less time consumption. This demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed approach.

AB A new method to autonomously collect larvae and environmental variables such as temperature, salinity, and circulation is described. A large volume in situ pumping system, recently developed for discrete biogeochemical sample collection in deep-sea environments, was adapted and mounted to the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) REMUS 600 for autonomous larval and environmental sampling in coastal waters. To assess the performance of this system, the distribution of barnacle larvae was assessed in March 2014 with two transects perpendicular to the coastline (similar to 9.9 and 11.2 km) in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, USA. The second transect included a complex sampling mission through a relatively deeper channel, and sampling at discrete depth intervals. In this deployment nearshore and surface waters were fresher, with distinct vertical stratification due to salinity. Barnacle larvae were classified into early nauplii, late nauplii, and cyprid stages, and the mitochondrial COI barcode marker was sequenced to identify individual larvae of different stages. In an analysis of 164 barcode sequences, larvae belonging to Amphibalanus sp., Semibalanus balanoides, and Chthamalus fragilis were found, with Amphibalanus sp. the most abundant larval taxon overall. In the second deployment, early and late nauplii were relatively more abundant near the bottom. However, there was no obvious pattern relative to depth with cyprids, and there were no clear cross-shore distributional patterns for nauplii and cyprids. While additional deployments are necessary to corroborate these observations, the results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. Autonomous vehicle based sampling has the potential to collect larvae of other invertebrates as well as zooplankton, and together with genetic identifications, overcomes many existing limitations and will provide valuable new insight in understanding larval distributions and transport dynamics.

AB Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is usually sensitive to trajectory deviations that cause serious motion error in the recorded data. In this paper, a coherent range-dependent map-drift (CRDMD) algorithm is developed to accommodate the range-variant motion errors. By utilizing the algorithm as an estimate core, robust motion compensation strategy is proposed for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) SAR imagery. CRDMD outperforms the conventional map-drift algorithms in both accuracy and efficiency. Real data experiments show that the proposed approach is appropriate for precise motion compensation for UAV SAR.

AB The steadfast emergence of AVs promises many advantages, including an enhanced driving and transportation experience for humans, and increased automation of the production and distribution cycles for businesses. Meanwhile, route planning tools have evolved greatly over recent years and have grown popular across the different sectors. Despite this evolution, we argue in this work that current route planning approaches are not readily applicable to AVs and their emerging requirements. A smooth and safe introduction of AVs into the road networks is therefore challenging, especially as the road is shared with vehicles at different levels of autonomy. In light of this, we review the enabling technologies for more capable route planning techniques and describe the inevitable elements and considerations for routing AVs in a mixed-traffic environment.

The algorithms present an efficient solution to the full update required by the compressed extended Kalman filter algorithm. It makes use of the relative landmark representation to develop very close to optimal decorrelation solutions. With this approach, the memory and computational requirements are reduced from similar to O(N-2) to similar to O(N*N-a), N and N-a proportional to the number of features in the map and features close to the vehicle, respectively. Experimental results are presented to verify the operation of the system when working in large outdoor environments.

TI Longitudinal and Lateral Trajectory Planning for the Typical Duty Cycle
   of Autonomous Load Haul Dump

AB With the development of intelligent mining, autonomous driving will be the basic function of intelligent Load Haul Dump (LHD). Trajectory planning is the key part of autonomous driving. Due to the articulated structure, the motion state variables of the front and rear bodies are strongly nonlinear, leading to complex nonlinear collision avoidance constraints. In addition, the articulated angle and angular velocity of the LHD have physically constraints. At the same time, the terminal attitude constraint should be considered since LHD is a mining equipment. All these factors bring great difficulties to LHD trajectory planning and none of the existing methods can deal with these factors directly. In order to solve these problems, according to the most common working scenario, a novel trajectory planning method is proposed for autonomous LHD based on numerical optimization, leading to a safe and feasible time-space trajectory for efficient production. The novelty of this work is the introduction of a longitudinal and lateral trajectory planning for the typical duty cycle of LHD. More importantly, by the ingenious concept for modeling, there are two salient features of the proposed method. Firstly, no angles are used as the decision variable, and secondly, the collision constraints of the rear car are not directly considered. Through this way, the number of nonlinear constraints and the complexity of the model can keep in a reasonable level, which makes the model easy to solve. At the same time, by giving the collision-free condition and limiting the heading angular velocity, the generated trajectory is collision-free and satisfies the physical constraints of articulated angle. Case studies confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. Adopting the proposed method to generate a spatiotemporal trajectory is beneficial to ensure safety and improve production efficiency.

ID PERFORMANCE; SIMULATOR; TASKS; REAL
AB There are many factors that will influence the workload of drivers during autonomous driving. To examine the correlation between different factors and the workload of drivers, the influence of different factors on the workload variations is investigated from subjective and objective viewpoints. Thirty-seven drivers were recruited to participant the semi-autonomous driving experiments, and the drivers were required to complete different NDRTs (Non-Driving-Related Tasks): mistake finding, chatting, texting, and monitoring when the vehicle is in autonomous mode. Then, we introduced collision warning to signal there is risk ahead, and the warning signal was triggered at different TB (Time Budget)s before the risk, at which time the driver had to take over the driving task. During driving, the NASA-TLX-scale data were obtained to analyze the variation of the driver's subjective workload. The driver's pupil-diameter data acquired by the eye tracker from 100 s before the TOR (Take-Over Request) to 19 s after the takeover were obtained as well. The sliding time window was set to process the pupil-diameter data, and the 119-s normalized average pupil-diameter data under different NDRTs were fitted and modeled to analyze the variation of the driver's objective workload. The results show that the total subjective workload score under the influence of different factors is as follows: obstacle-avoidance scene > lane-keeping scene; TB = 7 s and TB = 3 s have no significant difference; and mistake finding > chatting > texting > monitoring. The results of pupil-diameter data under different factors are as follows: obstacle-avoidance scene > lane-keeping scene; TB = 7 s > TB = 3 s; and monitoring type (chatting and monitoring) > texting type (mistake finding and texting). The research results can provide a reference for takeover safety prediction modeling based on workload.

AB New types of vehicles, such as electricity-powered and/or autonomous cars or buses, are under rapid development, but the time needed to turn the existing stock of traditional vehicles, such as privately-owned human-driven fossil fuelled passenger cars, will likely last several years during which mixed traffic is expected. Moreover, the likely effects of the introduction of such vehicles may not be necessarily positive. Thus, a careful analysis of their various impacts through well designed tools is needed. Main tools for transportation systems analysis are based on methods for travel demand assignment to a transportation network, commonly used to support transportation project assessment and evaluation.& nbsp;The original contribution of this paper is twofold. First, a modelling approach to multi vehicle type assignment is proposed, in this approach the user choice proportions among vehicle types available to users are the results of an explicit choice behaviour model instead of input data as in all existing papers on multi-vehicle assignment. This approach is applied for analysing assignment to transportation networks including Fixed-Point models for equilibrium assignment and Deterministic and Stochastic Process models for day-to-to dynamic assignment.& nbsp;Second, statistical methods are introduced to study the bifurcation of SP models, in order to account for the stochasticity of such models. In particular, the Hartigan's Dip statistic, which measure the degree of unimodality of a distribution, showed to be the most effective one in identifying bifurcation in SP models.& nbsp;Fixed-point stability and bifurcation analysis are carried out too, and some simple numerical examples are also discussed.& nbsp;Reported results show that innovative vehicles with less impact on congestion than traditional ones may not have a positive effect on equilibrium stability since negative effect of reducing route choice dispersion may be compensate the positive effects on congestion.

Particularly, we investigate the problem of synchronizing processes hold by each mobile agent of a time-varying network by applying the fully decentralized adaptive pinning control strategy to guarantee pinning synchronization of the mobile agent network under fast-switching constraint. We have also proposed a new motion model to define agents motion in the plane. Numerical simulations are given to validate the proposal. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The work presented here considers the problem of a decision and control scheme for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's). Specifically under examination is the generation of trajectories to follow by multiple UAV's to cooperatively search for targets in a given environment or area. First, a model of the situation is developed, which incorporates uncertainty in the environment, via the availability of some a priori data about target distribution. This model utilizes a method to efficiently store dynamic target location probability distributions. Then, a dynamic programming implementation is presented as a solution to the problem. Several key approximations are also given that produce a feasible and effective solution in the presence of constraints on communication and computational power. Results from simulations that illustrate the usefulness of this approach are provided.

For this purpose, georeferenced vehicle-pose information is often generated using sensor data fusion consisting of GNSS data, inertial measurement, and other applicable aiding sensors. This technical overview summarizes current European projects and international work in the field of GNSS-based maritime navigation and introduces and discusses the sensors and methods involved. The review focuses on approaches with proprioceptive sensor technology. Therefore, as a limitation, environment sensing algorithms (e. g., SLAM) are explicitly not included. It is concluded that highly accurate and reliable sensor fusion should include complementary and redundant onboard sensors, which are tightly coupled.

AB Small drones that navigate using cameras may be limited in their speed and agility by low onboard computing power. We evaluate the role of edge computing in 5G for such autonomous navigation. The offloading of image processing tasks to an edge server is studied with a vision-based navigation algorithm. Three computation modes are compared: onboard, fully offloaded to the edge, and partially offloaded. Partial offloading is expected to pose lower demands on the communication network in terms of transfer rate than full offloading but requires some onboard processing. Our results on the computation time help select the most suitable mode for image processing, i.e., whether and what to offload, based on the network conditions.

DE adaptive control; underwater robot; autonomous underwater vehicle
AB The control of underwater robots presents a number of unique and formidable challenges. Underwater robot dynamics are highly nonlinear, coupled, time varying and subject to hydrodynamic uncertainties and external disturbances such as current. Unlike land mobile robots,underwater robots cannot use GPS (global positioning system). Most popular underwater positioning sensors are sonar-based, such as long-base line (LBL). However, autonomous processing of sonar measurements is plagued by noise, dropouts, missed detection, false reading, poor resolution and other problems. This paper presents a new adaptive control of underwater robots with sonar-based position measurements. Experimental results show robustness of the control system in the presence of unmodeled dynamics and various noises. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 3D object detection is still an open problem in autonomous driving scenes. When recognizing and localizing key objects from sparse 3D inputs, autonomous vehicles suffer from a larger continuous searching space and higher fore-background imbalance compared to image-based object detection. In this letter, we aim to solve this fore-background imbalance in 3D object detection. Inspired by the recent use of focal loss in image-based object detection, we extend this hard-mining improvement of binary cross entropy to point-cloud-based object detection and conduct experiments to showits performance based on two different 3D detectors: 3D-FCN and VoxelNet. The evaluation results show up to 11.2AP gains through the focal loss in a wide range of hyperparameters for 3D object detection.

AB Here we describe, for the first time, the use of a miniaturized Lab-on-Chip (LoC) nutrient sensor deployed within an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV; Kongsberg Seaglider) to collect high-resolution nitrate (nitrate + nitrite) data in a highly dynamic shelf sea environment. Seasonally stratified temperate shelf seas act as important carbon sinks, where primary production is controlled by the availability of nutrients such as nitrate. Spring phytoplankton blooms and sporadic mixing events can drastically modify the availability of nitrate on temporal scales from hours to days. Traditional sampling methods are unable to capture high frequency events that can be clearly observed using a wet-chemical microfluidic system deployed within a glider. We highlight firstly, an excellent agreement between the LoC and shipboard nitrate + nitrite measurements (r(2) = 0.98 n = 11). Secondly, the LoC was able to observe a decrease in nitrate within the surface mixed layer from 5.74 mu M (4th) to 1.42 mu M (25th) during the onset of the spring bloom, whilst bottom layer concentrations remained constant (6.86 +/- 0.16 mu M), with an estimated analytical uncertaintly of < 0.2 mu M. Thirdly, the ability of an LoC sensor deployed within an AUV to accurately capture simultaneous biogeochemical and physical parameters at an enhanced resolution, on both spatial and temporal scales, improves our understanding of biogeochemical cycles within the dynamic temperate shelf sea environments.

ID OBSERVABILITY ANALYSIS; AUTONOMOUS FLIGHT; FUSION; MOTION; NAVIGATION
AB The recent technological advances in Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) have triggered great interest in the robotics community, as their deployability in missions of surveillance and reconnaissance has now become a realistic prospect. The state of the art, however, still lacks solutions that can work for a long duration in large, unknown, and GPS-denied environments. Here, we present our visual pipeline and MAV state-estimation framework, which uses feeds from a monocular camera and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to achieve real-time and onboard autonomous flight in general and realistic scenarios. The challenge lies in dealing with the power and weight restrictions onboard a MAV while providing the robustness necessary in real and long-term missions. This article provides a concise summary of our work on achieving the first onboard vision-based power-on-and-go system for autonomous MAV flights. We discuss our insights on the lessons learned throughout the different stages of this research, from the conception of the idea to the thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed framework and, finally, the real-world implementation and deployment. Looking into the onboard estimation of monocular visual odometry, the sensor fusion strategy, the state estimation and self-calibration of the system, and finally some implementation issues, the reader is guided through the different modules comprising our framework. The validity and power of this framework are illustrated via a comprehensive set of experiments in a large outdoor mission, demonstrating successful operation over flights of more than 360m trajectory and 70m altitude change.(1) (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Multi-sensor perception systems may have mismatched coordinates between each sensor even if the sensor coordinates are converted to a common coordinate. This discrepancy can be due to the sensor noise, deformation of the sensor mount, and other factors. These mismatched coordinates can seriously affect the estimation of a distant object's position and this error can result in problems with object identification. To overcome these problems, numerous coordinate correction methods have been studied to minimize coordinate mismatching, such as off-line sensor error modeling and real-time error estimation methods. The first approach, off-line sensor error modeling, cannot cope with the occurrence of a mismatched coordinate in real-time. The second approach, using real-time error estimation methods, has high computational complexity due to the singular value decomposition. Therefore, we present a fast online coordinate correction method based on a reduced sensor position error model with dominant parameters and estimate the parameters by using rapid math operations. By applying the fast coordinate correction method, we can reduce the computational effort within the necessary tolerance of the estimation error. By experiments, the computational effort was improved by up to 99.7% compared to the previous study, and regarding the object's radar the identification problems were improved by 94.8%. We conclude that the proposed method provides sufficient correcting performance for autonomous driving applications when the multi-sensor coordinates are mismatched.

AB Recent workat the U.S. Army CCDC Ground Vehicle Systems Center has shown that machine learning classifiers can quickly construct high-fidelity mobility maps. Training these classifiers, on the other hand, is still a challenge, since each data instance is labeled by performing a computationally intensive, physics-based simulation. In this paper we introduce an active learning framework, based on the query-by-bagging algorithm, that substantially reduces the number of simulations needed to train a classifier. Experimental results suggest that our sampling algorithm can train a neural network, with higher accuracy, using less than half the number of simulations when compared to random sampling.

AB With the development of communication and networking technologies, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has become the foundation of smart transportation. The development of blockchain and Machine Learning (ML) has contributed to the pervasiveness of the IoV, and they can effectively address the current issues of decentralisation, cyber security and data privacy in the IoV. In this article, blockchain and ML in the IoV are both reviewed, and corresponding technologies to support blockchain intelligence in the IoV are summarized. Importantly, blockchain intelligence is proposed as a key to integrate blockchain and ML, combining the advantages of both to drive the rapid development of the IoV. We discuss general frameworks, issuses, requirements and advantages for the implementation of blockchain intelligence in the IoV. Driven by its advantages, we summarize solutions of blockchain intelligence in the IoV from four aspects, including reliable interaction, network security and data privacy, trustworthy environment and scalability. Finally, a summary of current unresolved issues and challenges of blockchain intelligence in the IoV is presented, which provides guidelines for the future development of the IoV.

Two types of SDVs were presented: SDVs with a clear mention of positive EB information ("EB-enhanced SDVs") and SDVs without the mention of positive EB information ("normal SDVs"). Study 1 and Study 2 found that participants expressed higher risk acceptance and WTR regarding EB-enhanced SDVs. Further, Study 2 reported that higher trust in EB-enhanced SDVs, rather than lower negative affect associated with EB-enhanced SDVs, accounted for the participants' higher risk acceptance and WTR. Study 3 observed that the participants' acceptable risk of EB-enhanced SDVs was greater than that of normal SDVs in magnitude, although not significant. If SDVs can achieve the purported EB, the public may be willing to tolerate their risks more. Highlighting the environmental advantages of SDVs and increasing public trust in them are likely to be useful strategies for increasing societal acceptance of SDVs.

AB Naturally occurring flocks and swarms have long commanded human attention, with much engineering inspiration drawn from the beauty, order, and capability of these highly decentralized systems. More recent simulation and modeling of swarms has given rise to interesting mathematical problems as well as useful control strategies for machine applications. Although highway systems are sometimes mentioned in the literature as a possible swarm theory application, a microscopic, decentralized model of vehicle interactions based on swarming philosophy does not exist to our knowledge. In this paper, a decentralized model made up of ordinary differential equations and smooth functions is developed. It is designed to describe the interactions of vehicles on a two-lane highway. The purpose of this new model is not primarily traffic simulation, but rather cooperative control design. The philosophy behind the modeling is borrowed from work on swarm theory, especially those simulations employing the motion control ideas known as Reynolds' Rules. Vehicles in the swarm have different desired speeds, which can be maintained by changing lanes to avoid slower-moving lead vehicles, while also avoiding both frontal and side collisions. Stability analysis of the proposed model has been presented, as well as simulation results and possible uses.

AB An engineering design framework for an autonomous ground vehicle vision system is discussed. We present both the conceptual and physical design by following the design process, development and testing of an intelligent ground vehicle vision system constructed for the 2008 Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition. During conceptual design, the requirements for the vision system are explored via functional and process analysis considering the flows into the vehicle and the transformations of those flows. The conceptual design phase concludes with a vision system design that is modular in both hardware and software and is based on a laser range finder and camera for visual perception. During physical design, prototypes are developed and tested independently, following the modular interfaces identified during conceptual design. Prototype models, once functional, are implemented into the final design. The final vision system design uses a ray-casting algorithm to process camera and laser range finder data and identify potential paths. The ray-casting algorithm is a single thread of the robot's multithreaded application. Other threads control motion, provide feedback, and process sensory data. Once integrated, both hardware and software testing are performed on the robot. We discuss the robot's performance and the lessons learned. (C) 2010 SPIE and IS&T. [DOI: 10.1117/1.3528476]

AB With the rising interest in autonomous vehicles, developing radio access technologies (RATs) that enable reliable and low-latency vehicular communications has become of paramount importance. Dedicated short-range communications (DSRCs) and cellular V2X (C-V2X) are two present-day technologies that are capable of supporting day-1 vehicular applications. However, these RATs fall short of supporting communication requirements of many advanced vehicular applications, which are believed to be critical in enabling fully autonomous vehicles. Both the DSRC and C-V2X are undergoing extensive enhancements in order to support advanced vehicular applications that are characterized by high reliability, low latency, and high throughput requirements. These RAT evolutions-the IEEE 802.11bd for the DSRC and NR V2X for C-V2X-can supplement today's vehicular sensors in enabling autonomous driving. In this paper, we survey the latest developments in the standardization of 802.11bd and NR V2X. We begin with a brief description of the two present-day vehicular RATs. In doing so, we highlight their inability to guarantee the quality of service requirements of many advanced vehicular applications. We then look at the two RAT evolutions, i.e., the IEEE 802.11bd and NR V2X, outline their objectives, describe their salient features, and provide an in-depth description of key mechanisms that enable these features. While both, the IEEE 802.11bd and NR V2X, are in their initial stages of development, we shed light on their preliminary performance projections and compare and contrast the two evolutionary RATs with their respective predecessors.

AB Space recognition is a crucial issue for autonomous systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles, walking robots, and autonomous cars. These systems are necessary to obtain information using a camera while moving. However, reduction in recognition accuracy and system size increase has created problems. To solve these problems, we proposed the three-degree-of-freedom (DOF) actuator for image stabilization. This paper proposes a novel initial position estimation method and sensorless attitude estimation method for the three-DOF actuator to further downsize and reduce weight. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified by a magnetic field analysis, using a three-dimensional finite element method and numerical simulations.

AB This paper addresses the application of an autonomous guidance concept to the ascent flight of the reusable launch vehicle Hopper, and to the reentry mission of the space plane X-38. Presently, the guidance requirements with respect to autonomy, accuracy and mission flexibility have been increased steadily for RLV applications. Nonlinear Programming (NLP)-based guidance strategies have been proposed that offer the potential to meet these demands. The autonomous guidance is achieved by combining onboard flight path prediction and NLP methods for flight optimization. Such guidance strategies hold promise for reduced pre-mission analyses for trajectory planning, and for improved adaptability to non-nominal mission conditions. Its applicability, autonomy and performance will be discussed showing numerical results obtained with a flight-simulation environment. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Focusing on the problems of big overshoot and long convergence time due to the large initial heading error, a new path tracking control strategy for autonomous harvesting robots based on improved double arc path planning is designed. Firstly, the improved double arc path planning algorithm includes global path planning and local planning. The shortest path distance is taken as the goal, so the optimal tangent arc path from the initial point to the reference straight line can be automatically planned by the global path planning. Due to the problems such as control delay in harvesting robot, the global path cannot be effectively tracked. By analyzing the influence of the non-mutable steering angle and control delay on path tracking, a new local path planning algorithm is proposed. Then, the two preview points obtained in global planning can be optimized dynamically, and the actual reliability of the algorithm can be enhanced. Secondly, the error compensation model is designed to compensate the installation error of the positioning antenna in real time, to satisfy the simplified condition of the two-wheeled vehicle model. Finally, by combining the large angle steering control method and the pure pursuit algorithm, a new hybrid control strategy is designed to solve the steering angle, and the path tracking function of harvesting robots is realized. Experiment results demonstrate that the hybrid control strategy can reduce the oscillation of driving path, enhance the convergence, then, improve working quality and efficiency of robots.

AB This article presents a novel framework for acquiring visual data around 3D infrastructures, by establishing a team of fully autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) with robust localization, planning and perception capabilities. The proposed aerial system reaches high level of autonomy on a large scale, while pushing to the boundaries the real life deployment of aerial robotics. In the presented approach, the MAVs deployed around the structure rely only on their onboard computer and sensory systems. The developed framework envisions a modular system, combining open research challenges in the fields of localization, path planning and mapping, with an overall capability for a fast on site deployment and a reduced execution time that can repeatably perform the mission according to the operator needs. The architecture of the established system includes: 1) a geometry-based path planner for coverage of complex structures by multiple MAVs, 2) an accurate yet flexible localization component, which provides an accurate pose estimation for the MAVs by utilizing an Ultra Wideband fused inertial estimation scheme, and 3) visual data post-processing scheme for the 3D model building. The performance of the proposed framework has been experimentally demonstrated in multiple realistic outdoor field trials, all focusing on the challenging structure of a wind turbine as the main test case. The successful experimental results, depict the merits of the proposed autonomous navigation system as the enabling technology towards aerial robotic inspectors.

AB This letter is focused on the benchmark evaluation and comparison of the flapping and fixed wing flight modes on an hybrid platform developed for the realization of autonomous inspection operations outdoors. The platform combines the high range and endurance of fixed-wing UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), with the higher maneuverability and intrinsic safety of flapping wing in the interaction with humans during the hand launch and capture. A unified model of the hybrid platform is derived for both configurations following the Lagrange formulation to express the multi-body dynamics and aerodynamic forces of the flapping wing and the propellers. The proposed control scheme exploits the similarities of both flight modes in the tail actuation and in the generation of thrust either with the flapping wings or the propellers, in such a way that it can be implemented on conventional autopilots, facilitating in this way the adoption of this type of aerial platforms. To evaluate and compare the performance of both modes, a set of benchmark tests and metrics are defined, including the energy efficiency in forward flight, trajectory tracking, hand launch and capture, and accuracy in visual inspection. Experimental results in outdoors validate the developed prototype, identifying the fixed/flapping transitions, and evidencing the higher energy efficiency of the flapping wing mode compared to the fixed wing.

AB The autonomous exploration task we consider requires Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to actively navigate through unknown environments with the goal of fully perceiving and mapping the environments. Some existing exploration strategies suffer from rough cost budgets, ambiguous Information Gain (IG), and unnecessary backtracking exploration caused by Fragmented Regions (FRs). In our work, a hierarchical spatiotemporal-aware exploration framework is proposed to alleviate these problems. At the local exploration level, the Asymmetrical Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP) is solved by comprehensively considering exploration time, IG, and heading consistency to avoid blindly exploring. Specifically, the exploration time is reasonably budgeted by fast marching in an artificial potential field. Meanwhile, a transformer-based map occupancy predictor is designed to assist in IG calculation by imagining spatial clues out of the Field of View (FoV), facilitating the prescient exploration. We verify that our local exploration is effective in alleviating the unnecessary back-and-forth movements caused by FRs and the interference of potential obstacle occlusion on the IG calculation. At the global exploration level, the classical Next Best ViewPoints (NBVP) are generalized to Next Best Sub-Regions (NBSR) to choose informative sub-regions for further forward-looking exploration based on a well-designed utility function. Safe flight paths and dynamically feasible trajectories are reasonably generated throughout the exploration process by fast marching and B-spline curve optimization. Comparative simulations and benchmark tests demonstrate that our proposed exploration strategy is quite competitive in terms of exploration path length, total exploration time, and exploration ratio.

TI Understanding Transit Agency Perceptions about Transportation Network
   Companies, Shared Mobility, and Autonomous Transit: Lessons from the
   United States
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Emergent technologies like autonomous/connected vehicles and shared mobility platforms are anticipated to significantly affect various aspects of the transportation network such as safety, mobility, accessibility, environmental effects, and economics. Transit agencies play a critical role in this network by providing mobility to populations unable to drive or afford personal vehicles, and in some localities carry passengers more efficiently than other modes. As transit agencies plan for the future, uncertainty remains with how to best leverage new technologies. A survey completed by 50 transit agencies across the United States revealed similar yet different perceptions and preparations regarding transportation network companies (TNCs) and autonomous transit (AT) systems. Transit agencies believe TNC market share will grow, either minimally or rapidly (72%), within the next 5 years and have either a negative (43%) or positive (35%) impact on their transit system. Only 30% of agency boards instructed the agency to work with TNCs, despite no perceived transit union support. For AT systems, 22% of agencies are studying them, 64% believe the impacts of AT over the next 10-20 years will be positive, but fewer agencies are influenced to consider new technologies because of AT systems (38%) compared with TNCs (72%). Surprisingly, transit administration is mostly unsure about driver and transit unions' perceptions of these technologies. In addition, a significant number of transit agencies do not believe they should play a role in ensuring TNCs are safe and equitable and that TNCs should not have to adhere to the same regulations (50%, 28% respectively).

AB Case-based reasoning is reasoning based on specific instances of past experience. A new solution is generated by retrieving and adapting an old one which approximately matches the current situation. In this paper, we outline a case-based reasoning scheme for path planning in autonomous underwater vehicle (AW) missions. An annotated map database is employed to model the navigational environment. Routes which are used in earlier missions are represented as objects in the map. When a new route is to be planned, the path planner retrieves a matching route from the database and modifies it to suit to the current situation. Whenever a matching route is not available, a new route is synthesized based on past cases that describe similar navigational environments. Case-based approach is thus used not only to adapt old routes but also to synthesize new ones. Since the proposed scheme is centered around reuse of old routes, it would be fast especially when long routes need to be generated. Moreover, better reliability of paths can be expected as they are adapted from earlier missions. The scheme is novel and appropriate for AW mission scenarios. In this paper, we describe the representation of navigation environment including past routes and objects in the navigational space. Further, we discuss the retrieval and repair strategies and the scheme for synthesizing new routes. Sample results of both synthesis and reuse of routes and system performance analysis are also presented. One major advantage of this system is the facility to enrich the map database with new routes as they are generated.

AB Intersections are quite challenging among various driving scenes wherein the interaction of signal lights and distinct traffic actors poses great difficulty to learn a wise and robust driving policy. Current research rarely considers the diversity of intersections and stochastic behaviors of traffic participants. For practical applications, the randomness usually leads to some devastating events, which should be the focus of autonomous driving. This paper introduces an adversarial learning paradigm to boost the intelligence and robustness of driving policy for signalized intersections with dense traffic flow. Firstly, we design a static path planner which is capable of generating trackable candidate paths for multiple intersections with diversified topology. Next, a constrained optimal control problem (COCP) is built based on these candidate paths wherein the bounded uncertainty of dynamic models is considered to capture the randomness of driving environment. We propose adversarial policy gradient (APG) to solve the COCP wherein the adversarial policy is introduced to provide disturbances by seeking the most severe uncertainty while the driving policy learns to handle this situation by competition. Finally, a comprehensive system is established to conduct training and testing wherein the perception module is introduced and the human experience is incorporated to solve the yellow light dilemma. Simulation results indicate that the trained policy can handle the signal lights flexibly meanwhile realizing smooth and efficient passing with a humanoid paradigm. Besides, APG enables a large-margin improvement of the resistance to the abnormal behaviors and thus ensures a high safety level for the autonomous vehicle.

AB In the agricultural industry, an evolutionary effort has been made over the last two decades to achieve precise autonomous systems to perform typical in-field tasks, including harvesting, mowing, and spraying. One of the main objectives of an autonomous system in agriculture is to improve the efficiency while reducing the environmental impact and cost. Due to the nature of these operations, complete coverage path planning (CCPP) approaches play an essential role to find an optimal path which covers the entire field while taking into account land topography, operation requirements, and robot characteristics. The aim of this paper is to propose a CCPP approach defining the optimal movements of mobile robots over an agricultural field. First, a method based on tree exploration is proposed to find all potential solutions satisfying some predefined constraints. Second, a similarity check and selection of optimal solutions method is proposed to eliminate similar solutions and find the best solutions. The optimization goals are to maximize the coverage area and to minimize overlaps, nonworking path length, and overall travel time. To explore a wide range of possible solutions, our approach is able to consider multiple entrances for the robot. For fields with a complex shape, different dividing lines to split them into simple polygons are also considered. Our approach also computes the headland zones and covers them automatically which leads to a high coverage rate of the field.

AB Introduction: The emergence of autonomous vehicles (AV) heralds new methods of alcohol delivery that are likely to have substantial implications for home drinking. The aim of this study was to explore the factors that have the potential to hasten or restrict widescale increases in alcohol availability resulting from AVs.
   Methods: Thirty-six interviews were conducted with 44 stakeholders across diverse sectors. Interviewees discussed their perceptions of how AVs will evolve and the implications for alcohol access. The interview transcripts were analysed to develop a typology of factors that need to be addressed to minimise harms associated with greater home alcohol consumption due to AVs.
   Results: The interviewees identified a range of demand-side (e.g., enhanced convenience for consumers) and supply-side (e.g., increased efficiency for providers) factors associated with AV home deliveries that could increase the prevalence and volume of home drinking. A third category of factors related to potential forms of regulation: suggested harm-minimisation options related to appropriate enhancements of licensing restrictions and responsible service requirements and the use of various fiscal levers to introduce price barriers.
   Discussion and Conclusions: The suggested strategies will require collaborative efforts across government and non-government organisations to address the potential issues arising from the advent of AV alcohol deliveries. Technological and policy solutions will be needed to ensure responsible service of alcohol. This study provides policy makers with insights into forms of intervention that may be required to minimise the harms associated with the use of AVs in alcohol home delivery systems.

AB The Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors are being considered as new traffic infrastructure sensors to detect road users' trajectories for connected/autonomous vehicles and other traffic engineering applications. A LiDAR-enhanced traffic infrastructure system requires multiple LiDAR sensors around intersections, along with road segments, which can provide a seamless detection range at intersections or along arterials. Each LiDAR sensor generates cloud points of surrounding objects in a local coordinate system with the sensor at the origin, so it is necessary to integrate multiple roadside LiDAR sensors' data into the same coordinate system. None of existing methods can integrate the data from roadside LiDAR sensors, because the extensive detection range of roadside sensors generates low-density cloud points and the alignment of roadside sensors is different from mapping scans or autonomous sensing systems. This paper presents a method to register datasets from multiple roadside LiDAR sensors. This approach innovatively integrates LiDAR datasets with 3D cloud points of road surface and 2D reference point features, so the method is abbreviated as RGP (Registration with Ground and Points). The RGP method applies optimization algorithms to identify the optimized linear coordinate transformation. This research considered the genetic algorithm (global optimization) and the hill climbing algorithm (local optimization). The performance of the RGP method and the different optimization algorithms was evaluated with field LiDAR sensors data. When the developed process can integrate data from roadside sensors, it can also register LiDAR sensors' data on an autonomous vehicle or a robot.

AB An opportunistic advanced receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (OARAIM) algorithm for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation is developed. This algorithm fuses ambient terrestrial signals of opportunity (SOPs) with global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals to improve the capability of detecting GNSS and SOP measurement faults and provide tight protection level (PL) bounds. A receiver is assumed to make pseudorange measurements on multiple GNSS satellites and terrestrial SOPs. Experimental tests are presented injecting simulated faults into the OARAIM algorithm, which successfully detects the faults in GPS satellites and SOPs. Moreover, the OARAIM algorithm and the inclusion of the SOPs reduces the vertical and horizontal PLs by more than 55% and 70%, respectively, compared to only using GNSS measurements.

AB Automated Vehicles (AVs) are designed and programmed to follow traffic rules. However, there is no separate and comprehensive regulatory framework dedicated to AVs. The current Queensland traffic rules were designed for humans. These rules often contain open texture expressions, exceptions, and potential conflicts (conflict arises when exceptions cannot be handled in rules), which makes it hard for AVs to follow. This paper presents an automatic compliance checking framework to assess AVs behaviour against current traffic rules by addressing these issues. Specifically, it proposes a framework to determine which traffic rules and open texture expressions need some additional interpretation. Essentially this enables AVs to have a suitable and executable formalization of the traffic rules. Defeasible Deontic Logic (DDL) is used to formalize traffic rules and reasoning with AV information (behaviour and environment). The representation of rules in DDL helps effectively in handling and resolving exceptions, potential conflicts, and open textures in rules. 40 experiments were conducted on eight realistic traffic scenarios to evaluate the framework. The evaluation was undertaken both quantitatively and qualitatively. The evaluation result shows that the proposed framework is a promising system for checking Automated Vehicle interpretation and compliance with current traffic rules.

AB A novel biomimetic morphing micro aerial vehicle was designed using macro fiber composites (MFCs) as control actuators. The vehicle features variable-sweep, multi-curved wings, and a tail, both of which were embedded with MFC bimorphs. The wing design has a span of 1.1 m unswept (wings fully extended) and 0.65 m swept, resembling falcons (Falco Peregrinus). A design study was conducted on the outboard wing's MFC and carbon fiber substrate orientation to enhance the roll authority of the wings when fully extended. Finite element modeling, wind tunnel testing, and flight testing were conducted to model and optimize the design to obtain linear aerodynamic control with given MFC deflections. In addition, this research explores several configurations to increase roll authority of MFCs using segmented and overlapped sections resembling avian feathers. An overlapped wing configuration was discovered to have the potential to increase roll authority at the expense of adverse yaw. Flight testing proved that MFC-actuated, continuous outboard wings provide sufficient roll authority and handling quality without added compensation for the non-linear behavior of MFCs. This research showed that MFCs can be incorporated into a morphing wing design for manual flight and autonomous flight through feedback from inertial sensors onboard the vehicle.

AB The deployment of intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) is regarded as a significant solution to improve road safety, transportation management, and energy efficiency. This study assessed the safety, traffic, environmental, and industrial economic benefits of ICV deployment in China under different scenarios. A bottom-up model was established to deal with these impacts within a unified framework, based on the existing theories and literature of ICVs' cost-benefit analysis, as well as China's most recent policies and statistics. The results indicate that the total benefits may reach 13.25 to 24.02 trillion renminbi (RMB) in 2050, while a cumulative benefit-cost ratio of 1.15 to 3.06 suggests high cost-effectiveness. However, if the government and industry only focus on their own interests, the break-even point may be delayed by several years. Hence, an effective business model is necessary to enhance public-private cooperation in ICV implementation. Meanwhile, the savings of travel time costs and fleet labor costs play an important part in all socioeconomic impacts. Therefore, the future design of ICVs should pay more attention to the utilization of in-vehicle time and the real substitution for human drivers.

AB This article tackles the problem of a vehicle's geolocalization in urban areas. For this purpose, Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver is the main sensor. However, the use of GPS alone is not sufficient in many urban environments. GPS has to be helped with dead-reckoned sensors, map data, and cameras. A novel observation of the absolute pose of the vehicle is proposed to back up GPS and the drift of dead-reckoned sensors. This approach uses a new source of information that is a geographical 3-dimensional (3D) model of the environment in which the vehicle navigates. This virtual 3D city model is managed in real time by a 3D geographical information system (3D GIS). This pose's observation is constructed by matching the virtual image provided by the 3D GIS and the real image acquired by an onboard camera. An extended Kalman filter combines the sensors measurements to produce an estimation of the vehicle's pose. Experimental results using data from an odometer, a gyroscope, a GPS receiver, a camera, and an accurate geographical 3D model of the environment illustrate the developed approach.

AB . Reversible lanes are a cost-effective road control method to increase road capacity without significant infrastructure changes. However, their current fixed schedules and low frequency limit their effectiveness in adapting to dynamic traffic patterns. We propose leveraging autonomous driving technologies and cooperative intelligent transportation systems (C-ITS) to enable dynamic operation of reversible lanes. Our study aims to optimize reversible lane location, timing, and installation mode to maximize traffic capacity while minimizing costs, including potential risks and economic expenses. By formulating the problem as a minimum-cost maximum-flow approach for an urban traffic network, we address key decision-making challenges in setting up reversible lanes. We find that choosing the installation mode involves a trade-off between expenses and safety guarantees. We also explore how autonomous driving technology impacts the installation of dynamic reversible lanes. Our results show that dynamic operation with suitable modes significantly improves traffic optimization from both economic and efficiency perspectives. Additionally, autonomous driving reduces risk costs and enhances dynamic adjustment efficiency. We validate the proposed algorithm through comparisons and experiments with real-world traffic data from Xi'an city, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in optimizing reversible lanes.

DE Autonomous exploration; semantic segmentation; UAV; path planning;

AB In this paper, we present a novel 3D autonomous exploration planner called the Autonomous Semantic Exploration Planner (ASEP), designed for GPS-denied indoor environments. ASEP combines real-time mapping, exploration, navigation, object detection, and object labeling onboard an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with limited resources. The planner is based on a frontier exploration strategy that utilizes semantic information about the environment in the exploration policy. The policy is extended to incorporate both geometric and semantic information provided by a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for semantic segmentation. This semantically-enhanced exploration algorithm directs the exploration toward the quick labeling of all objects of interest in the environment. An extended path planning algorithm continuously checks for path validity, enabling safe navigation in challenging environments. The overall system is designed to be modular and easily extended or replaced with custom modules. The proposed planner is evaluated and analyzed in both simulation and real-world environments using a UAV. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the ASEP strategy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Results show that the objects in the environment are explored faster and total exploration time is reduced while the computational time remains consistent regardless of the semantic segmentation processing involved.

AB Passive acoustics is a tool to monitor behavior, distributions, and biomass of marine invertebrates, fish, and mammals. Typically, fixed passive acoustic monitoring platforms are deployed, using a priori knowledge of the location of the target vocal species. Here, we demonstrate the ability to conduct coastal surveys of fish choruses, spatially mapping their distributions with an autonomous surface vehicle. For this study, we used an autonomous Liquid Robotics Wave Glider SV3 equipped with a Remora-ST underwater acoustic recorder and hydrophone. The exploratory 15-day deployment transited through three marine reserves, resulting in approx. 200 h of passive acoustic recordings, and revealed five distinct fish choruses from La Jolla to Capistrano Beach, CA (approx. 80 km separation), each with unique acoustic signatures. Choruses occurred in the evening hours, typically in the 40 to 1000 Hz band. There was a lack of both temporal and frequency partitioning amongst the choruses, but some choruses exhibited distinct spatial niches by latitude and water temperature. These results suggest that the mobility of the Wave Glider allows for persistent surveys and studies that otherwise may be too challenging or costly for stationary or ship-based sensors; a critical consideration for documenting biological activity over large spatiotemporal scales, or sampling of nearshore marine reserves.

AB The marine environment is vast, harsh, and challenging. Unanticipated faults and events might lead to loss of vessels, transported goods, collected scientific data, and business reputation. Hence, systems have to be in place that monitor the safety performance of operation and indicate if it drifts into an intolerable safety level. This article proposes a process for developing safety indicators for the operation of autonomous marine systems (AMS). The condition of safety barriers and resilience engineering form the basis for the development of safety indicators, synthesizing and further adjusting the dual assurance and the resilience based early warning indicator (REWI) approaches. The article locates the process for developing safety indicators in the system life cycle emphasizing a timely implementation of the safety indicators. The resulting safety indicators reflect safety in AMS operation and can assist in planning of operations, in daily operational decision-making, and identification of improvements. Operation of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) exemplifies the process for developing safety indicators and their implementation. The case study shows that the proposed process leads to a comprehensive set of safety indicators. It is expected that application of the resulting safety indicators consequently will contribute to safer operation of current and future AMS.

AB Location awareness is vital for many existing and emerging applications, especially in the context of 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) networks. However, current solutions generally fail to provide location information with the accuracy necessary for many location-based services and efficient resource management. For example, satellite navigation systems are hampered in complex environments such as urban canyons and indoor conditions, while 4G and Wi-Fi networks fail to provide the level of accuracy required by several emerging applications. On the other hand, precise localization of user equipment is often a required feature for many existing services, as well as a mandatory requirement for future ones that will be deployed over B5G networks.

TI Towards Robust Decision-Making for Autonomous Driving on Highway

AB Reinforcement learning (RL) methods are commonly regarded as effective solutions for designing intelligent driving policies. Nonetheless, even if the RL policy is converged after training, it is notoriously difficult to ensure safety. In particular, RL policy is susceptible to insecurity in the presence of long-tail or unseen traffic scenarios, i.e., out-of-distribution test data. Therefore, the design of the RL-based decision-making method must account for this shift in distribution. This paper proposes a robust decision-making framework for autonomous driving on the highway to improve driving safety. First, a Deep Deterministic PolicyGradient (DDPG)-basedRLpolicy that directly maps observations to actions is constructed. Subsequently, the model uncertainty of the DDPG policy is evaluated at runtime to quantify the policy's reliability and identify unseen scenarios. In addition, a complementary principle-based policy is developed using the intelligent driver model (IDM) and the model for minimizing overall braking induced by lane changes (MOBIL). It will take over the DDPG policy when encountering unseen scenarios to guarantee a lower-bound performance of the decision-making system. Finally, the proposed method is implemented on an embedded system, i.e., NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier, and out-of-training distribution challenging cases are considered in the experiment, i.e., observation with sensor noise, traffic density increasing significantly, objects falling from the front vehicle, and road construction causing temporal changes in road structure. Results indicate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks. Additionally, the code is provided.

TI AADS: Augmented autonomous driving simulation using data-driven

DT Article
ID OF-THE-ART; IMAGE
AB Simulation systems have become essential to the development and validation of autonomous driving (AD) technologies. The prevailing state-of-the-art approach for simulation uses game engines or high-fidelity computer graphics (CG) models to create driving scenarios. However, creating CG models and vehicle movements (the assets for simulation) remain manual tasks that can be costly and time consuming. In addition, CG images still lack the richness and authenticity of real-world images, and using CG images for training leads to degraded performance. Here, we present our augmented autonomous driving simulation (AADS). Our formulation augmented real-world pictures with a simulated traffic flow to create photorealistic simulation images and renderings. More specifically, we used LiDAR and cameras to scan street scenes. From the acquired trajectory data, we generated plausible traffic flows for cars and pedestrians and composed them into the background. The composite images could be resynthesized with different viewpoints and sensor models (camera or LiDAR). The resulting images are photorealistic, fully annotated, and ready for training and testing of AD systems from perception to planning. We explain our system design and validate our algorithms with a number of AD tasks from detection to segmentation and predictions. Compared with traditional approaches, our method offers scalability and realism. Scalability is particularly important for AD simulations, and we believe that real-world complexity and diversity cannot be realistically captured in a virtual environment. Our augmented approach combines the flexibility of a virtual environment (e.g., vehicle movements) with the richness of the real world to allow effective simulation.

AB Survey-grade Lidar brands have commercialized Lidar-based mobile mapping systems (MMSs) for several years now. With this high-end equipment, the high-level accuracy quality of point clouds can be ensured, but unfortunately, their high cost has prevented practical implementation in autonomous driving from being affordable. As an attempt to solve this problem, we present a cost-effective MMS to generate an accurate 3D color point cloud for autonomous vehicles. Among the major processes for color point cloud reconstruction, we first synchronize the timestamps of each sensor. The calibration process between camera and Lidar is developed to obtain the translation and rotation matrices, based on which color attributes can be composed into the corresponding Lidar points. We also employ control points to adjust the point cloud for fine tuning the absolute position. To overcome the limitation of Global Navigation Satellite System/Inertial Measurement Unit (GNSS/IMU) positioning system, we utilize Normal Distribution Transform (NDT) localization to refine the trajectory to solve the multi-scan dispersion issue. Experimental results show that the color point cloud reconstructed by the proposed MMS has a position error in centimeter-level accuracy, meeting the requirement of high definition (HD) maps for autonomous driving usage.

DT Article
DE Semantic segmentation; importance-aware loss; deep leaning; autonomous

ID IMAGES
AB Semantic segmentation (SS) partitions an image into several coherent semantically meaningful parts and classifies each part into one of the pre-determined classes. In this paper, we argue that the existing SS methods cannot be reliably applied to autonomous driving system as they ignore the different importance levels of distinct classes for safe driving. For example, pedestrian, car, and bicyclist in the scene are much more important than sky and building when driving a car, so their segmentations should be as accurate as possible. To incorporate the importance information possessed by various object classes, this paper designs an "importance-aware loss" (IAL) that specifically emphasizes the critical objects for autonomous driving. The IAL operates under a hierarchical structure and the classes with different importance are located in different levels so that they are assigned distinct weights. Furthermore, we derive the forward and backward propagation rules for IAL and apply them to four typical deep neural networks for realizing SS in an intelligent driving system. The experiments on CamVid and Cityscapes data sets reveal that, by employing the proposed loss function, the existing deep learning models, including FCN, SegNet, ENet, and ERFNet, are able to consistently obtain the improved segmentation results on the pre-defined important classes for safe driving.

AB Verification and validation (V&V) hold a significant position in the research and development of automated vehicles (AVs). Current literature indicates that different V&V techniques have been implemented in the decision-making and planning (DMP) system to improve AVs' safety, comfort, and energy optimization. This paper aims to review a range of different V&V approaches for the DMP system of AVs and divides these approaches into three distinct categories: scenario-based testing, fault injection testing, and formal verification. Further, scenario-based testing is categorized into fundamental and advanced approaches based on the interaction between road users in generated scenarios. In this paper, six criteria are proposed to compare and evaluate the characteristics of V&V approaches, which could help researchers gain insight into the benefits and limitations of the reviewed approaches and assist with approach choices. Next, the DMP system is broken down into a hierarchy of modules, and the functional requirements of each module are deduced. The suitable approaches are matched to verify and validate each module aiming at their different functional requirements. Finally, the current challenges and future research directions are concluded.

AB A novel GPU-accelerated simulation model of large-scale fleet deployment, which can run countrywide, multi-modal scenarios with millions of agents and fleets of tens of thousands of vehicles within a couple of minutes, is presented. Multiple scenarios of the deployment of fleets of automated vehicles in Switzerland's largest city, Zurich, are assessed. The simulations include the whole population of Switzerland (3.5 million car owners and 1.7 million public transit users) with their detailed travel demand, the road network (1.1 million links and 0.5 million intersections), and public transit (30 000 stops and 20 000 routes). It is demonstrated that in Zurich one automated vehicle could replace 7-8 private cars with an average increase in the road travel time of 44% and with wait times in the range of 10-15 min, provided travel demand remains constant. Furthermore, for the same fleet size, this novel accelerated simulation model runs up to 9 times faster compared to existing state-of-the-art tools.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Model-based trajectory tracking has become a widely used technique for automated driving system applications. A critical design decision is the proper selection of a vehicle model that achieves the best trade-off between real-time capability and robustness. Blending different types of vehicle models is a recent practice to increase the operating range of model-based trajectory tracking control applications. However, current approaches focus on the use of longitudinal speed as the blending parameter, with a formal procedure to tune and select its parameters still lacking. This work presents a novel approach based on lateral accelerations, along with a formal procedure and criteria to tune and select blending parameters, for its use on model-based predictive controllers for autonomous driving. An electric passenger bus traveling at different speeds over urban routes is proposed as a case study. Results demonstrate that the lateral acceleration, which is proportional to the lateral forces that differentiate kinematic and dynamic models, is a more appropriate model-switching enabler than the currently used longitudinal velocity. Moreover, the advanced procedure to define blending parameters is shown to be effective. Finally, a smooth blending method offers better tracking results versus sudden model switching ones and non-blending techniques.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ERGONOMICS

DT Article
DE Unmanned aerial vehicles; Time pressure; Uncertainty
AB Autonomous unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) are being utilized at an increasing rate for a number of military applications. The role of a human operator differs from that of a pilot in a manned aircraft, and this new role creates a need for a shift in interface and task design in order to take advantage of the full potential of these systems. This study examined the effects of time pressure and target uncertainty on autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle operator task performance and workload. A 2 x 2 within subjects experiment design was conducted using Multi-Modal Immersive Intelligent Interface for Remote Operation (MIIIRO) software. The primary task was image identification, and secondary tasks consisted of responding to events encountered in typical UAS operations. Time pressure was found to produce a significant difference in subjective workload ratings as well as secondary task performance scores, while target uncertainty was found to produce a significant difference in the primary task performance scores. Interaction effects were also found for primary tasks and two of the secondary tasks. This study has contributed to the knowledge of UAS operation, and the factors which may influence performance and workload within the UAS operator. Performance and workload effects were shown to be elicited by time pressure. Relevance to industry: The research findings from this study will help the UAS community in designing human computer interface and enable appropriate business decisions for staffing and training, to improve system performance and reduce the workload.

AB Advances in mobile robotics and autonomous systems are shaping our world, where robots are to replace humans in many aspects of life. The concern of our research group is to automate routine applications that require high precision and to be accomplished at cost-effective approaches. "Search and Find" is one such application that meets those criteria. In this project, we have developed, implemented, and tested the Advanced Search and Find System (ASAFS) which is an advanced search and find application where a group of heterogeneous robots perform a coordinated search mission over a given area. Heterogeneous robots are mobile robots made with divergent functions to fly, drive, or surf in 3-D real world. The challenge we have faced in developing such a system is how to integrate multiple mobile agents in a unified platform that plans, controls, and oversees the search and find assignment. The answer to this challenge points eventually to the use of IoT as a leading framework for interoperability and system integration. The Multiple Autonomous Unmanned Vehicle Experimental Testbed (MAUVET) is an IoT-based platform designed with many considerations to accommodate next-generation UAV applications development and deployment. MAUVET is an open-architecture platform with open communication standards and modular software core functions. This paper presents ASAFS and MAUVET architectures with focus on IoT considerations as far as the hardware and software architecture. We also present results from field experiments that are relevant to the state of the art.

ID DESIGN
AB This paper presents a solution to the problem of trajectory tracking control for autonomous surface craft (ASC) in the presence of ocean currents. The proposed solution is rooted in nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) techniques and addresses explicitly state and input constraints. Whereas state saturation constraints are added to the underlying optimization cost functional as penalties, input saturation constraints are made intrinsic to the nonlinear model used in the optimization problem, thus reducing the computational burden of the resulting NMPC algorithm. Simulation results, obtained with a nonlinear dynamic model of a prototype ASC, show that the NMPC strategy adopted yields good performance in the presence of constant currents. Experimental results are also provided to validate the real-time implementation of the NMPC techniques for ASCs.

AB Motivated by interest in the collective behavior of autonomous agents, we lay foundations for a study of networks of rigid bodies and, specifically, the problem of aligning orientation and controlling relative position across the group. Our main result is the reduction of the (networked) system for the case of two individuals coupled by control inputs that depend only on relative configuration. We use reduction theory based on semi-direct products, yielding Poisson spaces that enable efficient formulation of control laws. We apply these reduction results to satellite and underwater vehicle dynamics, proving stability of coordinated behaviors such as two underwater vehicles moving at constant speed with their orientations stably aligned.

AB This paper proposes a behavior planning algorithm for self-driving vehicles to handle lane keeping, speed control considering inter-vehicle space, and collision avoidance under uncertainty. The behavior planning approach is structured as a hierarchically organized Markov Decision Process (MDP) comprising two components: the path planning MDP and the speed profiling MDP. The path planning MDP generates multiple path candidates using lane-change path data collected from human drivers. Evaluation of each path candidate is based on reward and penalty terms. The path planning MDP spans and updates considering the predicted simulation time of the path candidate. Subsequently, the speed profiling MDP determines the optimal sequence of speeds for the host vehicle on the planned path. Evaluation of the path and speed profile utility is performed using reward and penalty terms based on the current states of vehicles and road structure. A unique aspect of this approach is the incorporation of uncertainty-aware collision risk and interaction-aware gap penalty, which account for the uncertainty of perception and traffic motion. Various cut-in scenarios are presented in simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB Compact design in receiver and misalignment tolerance are two basic considerations for practical applications of wireless power transfer (WPT) in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). To balance these two requirements, a novel magnetic design with the composite interval-acted parallel- & vertical-flux throw, orthogonal two-dimensional flux pick-up, and power-flow summed output is proposed in this letter. The resulting magnetic structure includes a target-shaped transmitter and two quadrature receivers, and the transmitter consists of four annular-type coils which are magnetized in a bipolar mode, making it possible to form a magnetic field with a parallel- and vertical-flux complementary distribution. Moreover, by integrating two orthogonal receiving coils into one receiver, a stable summed output current can supply the UAV onboard load with only a small size receiver. A UAV WPT prototype is established based on the proposal. The results show that the prototype can deliver 325 W with a system efficiency of 86%, and especially the variation of the output current is within +/- 0.76 A for different landing positions and directions. The overall system efficiency is from 87.3% down to 83.1%.

AB This work presents a control structure designed to autonomously guide two of-the-shelf quadrotors navigating in outdoor environments, as a leader-follower formation. The objective is to show how simple is to design controllers to guide the two vehicles when taking into account practical assumptions and simplifications in their model. This way, the main contribution of the paper is to show how practical knowledge obtained from real experiments using of-the-shelf quadrotors, translated to the assumptions and simplifications applied to its model, can help in the design of a suitable controller. The basic premise is that the quadrotor is driven by high-level commands that excite its degrees of freedom. The control system here designed following such reasoning is implemented in a ground station that allows manual or automatic control of the leader vehicle, with the follower one always automatically controlled. Experimental results in real outdoor scenarios, subject to unpredicted disturbances, validate the assumptions and simplifications applied to the model of the quadrotor, and the proposed control structure as well.

DE Clothiod curve; double lane change; rollover; optimal control; vehicle
   dynamics; path following
AB Path planning and path following are core components in safe autonomous driving. Typically, a path planner provides a path with some tolerance on how tightly the path should be followed. Based on that, and other path characteristics, for example, sharpness of curves, a speed profile needs to be assigned so that the vehicle can stay within the given tolerance without going unnecessarily slow. Here, such trajectory planning is based on optimal control formulations where critical cases arise as on-the-limit solutions. The study focuses on heavy commercial vehicles, causing rollover to be of a major concern, due to the relatively high centre of gravity. Several results are obtained on required model complexity depending on path characteristics, for example, quantification of required path tolerance for a simple model to be sufficient, quantification of when yaw inertia needs to be considered in more detail, and how the curvature rate of change interplays with available friction. Overall, in situations where the vehicle is subject to a wide range of driving conditions, from good transport roads to more tricky avoidance manoeuvres, the requirements on the path following will vary. For this, the provided results form a basis for real-time path following.

AB The autonomous connected ambulance (ACA) has been an unprecedented necessity in the demand-supply management sector of the healthcare sector. However, the traditional prototypes designed for such an unmanned vehicle do not match the demands of the advanced communication technologies incorporated in today's sophisticated distributed networks. As a result, in the current era of edge computing strengthened by many AI-enabled algorithms, there is an urgent need to design a route resource recommendation (R3) protocol for ACA under Edge-AI. Designing such a protocol requires addressing the major challenges to optimize the routes for ACA and, thereby, enhance the services of emergency eHealth centers through a governing telehealth monitoring administrator. Therefore, in this article, a dedicated and novel ACA-R3 protocol is proposed to address the issues of connectivity and resource management in ACA to optimize the routes for ACA. The ACA-R3 protocol abides by the operational standards of both the eHealth protocol and governing protocol. The primary objective of the current research work was to reduce the handover time and simplify the patient-information exchange during the time of demanded emergencies. The proposed ACA-R3 protocol can enhance the collaborative distributive resource management for reliable decision making from the data generated by the GPS tracking unit in ACA and Edge-AI. The experimental results obtained from three different cases of traffic congestion are evaluated, validated, and reported in this article.

TI Map management for robust long-term visual localization of an autonomous

ID EXPERIENCE
AB Changes in appearance present a tremendous problem for the visual localization of an autonomous vehicle in outdoor environments. Data association between the current image and the landmarks in the map can be challenging in cases where the map was built with different environmental conditions. This paper introduces a solution to build and use multi-session maps incorporating sequences recorded in different conditions (day, night, fog, snow, rain, change of season, etc.). During visual localization, we exploit a ranking function to extract the most relevant keyframes from the map. This ranking function is designed to take into account the pose of the vehicle as well as the current environmental condition. In the mapping phase, covering all conditions by constantly adding data to the map leads to a continuous growth in the map size which in turn deteriorates the localization speed and performance. Our map management strategy is an incremental approach that aims to limit the size of the map while keeping it as diverse as possible. Our experiments were performed on real data collected with our autonomous shuttle as well as on a widely used public dataset. The results demonstrate that our keyframe-based ranking function is suitable for long-term scenarios. Our map management algorithm aims to build a map with as much diversity as possible whereas some state of the art approaches tend to filter out the less observed landmarks. This strategy shows a reduction of localization failures while maintaining real-time performance.

TI Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Valet Parking in Narrow Environments
   With Enhanced Hybrid A* Search and Nonlinear Optimization
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT VEHICLES
LA English
DT Article
DE Autonomous parking; trajectory planning; numerical optimization;

ID ALGORITHM
AB This article focuses on the problem of autonomous valet parking trajectory planning in complex environments. The task normally can be well described by an optimal control problem (OCP) for the rapid, accurate, and optimal trajectory generation. Appropriate initial guesses obtained by sampling or searching-based methods are important for the numerical optimization procedure. Still, in highly complex environments with narrow passages, it may incur high computational costs or fail to find the proper initial guess. To address this challenge, an enhanced hybrid A* (EHA) algorithm is proposed to address the issue. The EHA includes four steps. The first step is to quickly obtain the global coarse trajectory using a traditional A* search. The second step is constructing a series of driving corridors along the rough trajectory, then evaluating and extracting nodes from each wide or narrow passage based on the length of the box's side. The third step is to extract each passage's boundary points. The final step is connecting boundary points by hybrid A* and generating a feasible initial guess for OCP. To reduce safety risks, vehicles in particular areas (Fig. 1(b)) should travel as slowly as possible. The global and local speed restrictions are distinct, and local restrictions are only activated when the vehicle enters a particular area. This "if-else" structure makes the optimization problem difficult. A novel approximation formulation for these local state constraints is introduced to overcome this issue. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method for trajectory planning is effective and robust.

AB An important research direction in the field of traffic light recognition of autonomous systems is to accurately obtain the region of interest (ROI) of the image through the multi-sensor assisted method. Dynamic evaluation of the performance of the multi-sensor (GNSS, IMU, and odometer) fusion positioning system to obtain the optimum size of the ROI is essential for further improvement of recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a dynamic estimation adjustment (DEA) model construction method to optimize the ROI. First, according to the residual variance of the integrated navigation system and the vehicle velocity, we divide the innovation into an approximate Gaussian fitting region (AGFR) and a Gaussian convergence region (GCR) and estimate them using variational Bayesian gated recurrent unit (VBGRU) networks and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), respectively, to obtain the GNSS measurement uncertainty. Then, the relationship between the GNSS measurement uncertainty and the multi-sensor aided ROI acquisition error is deduced and analyzed in detail. Further, we build a dynamic estimation adjustment model to convert the innovation of the multi-sensor integrated navigation system into the optimal ROI size of the traffic lights online. Finally, we use the YOLOv4 model to detect and recognize the traffic lights in the ROI. Based on laboratory simulation and real road tests, we verify the performance of the DEA model. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more suitable for the application of autonomous vehicles in complex urban road scenarios than the existing achievements.

AB This paper explores the use of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with sensors to construct water quality models to aid in the assessment of important environmental hazards, for instance related to point-source pollutants or localized hypoxic regions. Our focus is on problems requiring the autonomous discovery and dense sampling of critical areas of interest in real-time, for which standard (e.g., grid-based) strategies are not practical due to AUV power and computing constraints that limit mission duration. To this end, we consider adaptive sampling strategies on Gaussian process (GP) stochastic models of the measured scalar field to focus sampling on the most promising and informative regions. Specifically, this study employs the GP upper confidence bound as the optimization criteria to adaptively plan sampling paths that balance a trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Two informative path planning algorithms based on (i) branch-and-bound techniques and (ii) cross-entropy optimization are presented for choosing future sampling locations while considering the motion constraints of the sampling platform. The effectiveness of the proposed methods are explored in simulated scalar fields for identifying multiple regions of interest within a three-dimensional environment. Field experiments with an AUV using both virtual measurements on a known scalar field and in situ dissolved oxygen measurements for studying hypoxic zones validate the approach's capability to quickly explore the given area, and then subsequently increase the sampling density around regions of interest without sacrificing model fidelity of the full sampling area.

AB The uncertainty of cyclists' movements has a significant impact on predicting the risk of collisions between cyclists and vehicles. The purpose of this study was to provide a method for assessing collision risk using probability, taking into account the uncertainty of cyclists' movements. A cyclist model was first developed using a first-order Markov model. Then, based on Monte Carlo sampling, the distribution characteristics of the minimum distance and the time-to-collision (TTC) between the vehicle and the cyclist were extracted. By fitting these features, the probability density functions of the collision distance and TTC were estimated to derive the collision probabilities. The effectiveness of the collision probability prediction model was benchmarked against a deterministic crash risk prediction model (autonomous emergency braking [AEB] system) applied to three real-world cases previously reconstructed in an in-depth crash database. The results show that the collision probability prediction model can effectively predict the risk of collisions between cyclists and vehicles with better accuracy than AEB systems using a fixed trigger threshold. This study is a valuable reference for the development of advanced vehicle collision avoidance systems to protect cyclists and other vulnerable road users.

AB The energy efficiency of port container terminal equipment and the reduction of CO2 emissions are among one of the biggest challenges facing every seaport in the world. The article pre-sents the modeling of the container transportation process in a terminal from the quay crane to the stack using battery-powered Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) to estimate the energy consump-tion parameters. An AGV speed control algorithm based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is proposed to optimize the energy consumption of container transportation. The results obtained and compared with real transportation measurements showed that the proposed DRL-based approach dynamically changing the driving speed of the AGV reduces energy consumption by 4.6%. The obtained results of the research provide the prerequisites for further research in order to find optimal strategies for autonomous vehicle movement including context awareness and infor-mation sharing with other vehicles in the terminal.(c) 2022 THE AUTHORS.

AB With the increasing connectedness of vehicles, real-time spatio-temporal data can be collected from citywide road networks. Innovative data management solutions can process the collected data for the purpose of reducing travel time. However, a majority of the existing solutions have missed the opportunity to better manage the collected data for improving road safety at the network level. We propose an efficient data management framework that uses network-level data to improve road safety for citywide applications. Our framework uses a graph-based data structure to maintain real-time network-level traffic data. Based on the graph, the framework uses a novel technique to generate driving instructions for individual vehicles. By following the instructions, inter-vehicular spacing can be increased, leading to an improvement of road safety. Experimental results show that our framework improves road safety, measured based on the time to collision between vehicles, from the state-of-the-art traffic data management solutions by a large margin while achieving lower travel times compared with the solutions. The framework is also readily deployable for large-scale real-time applications due to its low computation costs.

AB Integrated Chassis Control (ICC) is one of the most appealing subjects for vehicle dynamics specialists and researchers, due to the increasing number of chassis actuators of modern human-driven and automated cars. ICC ensures that the potential of the available actuators is systematically exploited, by overcoming the individual limitations, and solving conflicts and redundancies, which results into enhanced vehicle performance, ride comfort and safety. This paper is a literature review on ICC, and focuses on the topics that are left uncovered by the most recent surveys on the subject, or that are dealt with only by old surveys, namely: a) the systematic categorisation of the available ICC architectures, with the critical analysis of their strengths and weaknesses; b) the latest ICC approaches, which are becoming feasible with modern automotive microcontrollers; c) the driving performance requirements; and d) the procedures to objectively evaluate ICC performance. The manuscript aids the interested reader in the choice of the most appropriate ICC method for the specific requirements, and concludes with the recent developments and future trends.

ID TIRE BLOWOUT; DESIGN
AB Run-flat tires are a significant way to prevent the tire blowout traffic accidents and the inserts supporting run-flat tire (ISRFT) can successfully address the problem of zero-pressure driving after the tire blowout. The dynamic response characteristics must be developed using a reasonable tire model since the characteristics of vehicles fitted with this run-flat tire following tire blowout differ from those of normal tires (NT). In this paper, steady-state mechanical characteristics tests were carried out to obtain the mechanical characteristics after the theoretical analysis of the zero-pressure rolling for the ISRFT. Secondly, a dynamics model based on the UniTire model was developed for ISRFT with the consideration of camber angle. Finally, the effect of various camber angles on the tire blowout parameters of vehicles equipped with ISRFT and NT was compared using three sets of typical working conditions, which demonstrated the superiority of the ISRFT. The results indicate that the optimal characteristic of the vehicle equipped with ISRFT compared to vehicles equipped with NT is improved by 14.02% under steering conditions and 12.75% under double lane change conditions. This study provides a foundation for improving the autonomous characteristics of vehicles.

AB Autonomous path following has gained tremendous popularity during the last few decades. Numerous researchers have contributed to the development of highly automated navigation systems using different types of sensors and their combination. However, their proposed approaches do not provide a cost-efficient solution because of the deployment of exorbitant and sophisticated sensors, which remains a challenging problem for customized vehicles used in academic research. To overcome this issue, this study presents an economically efficient sensorless steering angle approach that employs a single camera for steering control and quick response (QR) based localization of a vehicle. Moreover, we used SONAR for object detection in a defined route to avoid possible collisions. The proposed technique combines a Probablistic Hough Transfrom for lane detection and QR codes, which helps the vehicle stay in its lane for stabilized control. To prove the efficiency of our approach, we tested it on our developed prototype vehicle named EMO. To validate the proposed approach through in-field testing, we designed a customized test track within the campus. The experimental results show the benefit of our proposed approach compared to existing methods available in the literature.

AB One important problem in autonomous robot navigation is the effective following of an unknown path traced in the environment in compliance with the kinematic limits of the vehicle, i.e., bounded linear and angular velocities and accelerations. In this case,the motion planning must be implemented in real-time and must be robust with respect to the geometric characteristics of the unknown path, namely curvature and sharpness. To achieve good tracking capability, this paper proposes a path following approach based on a fuzzy-logic set of rules which emulates the human driving behavior. The input to the fuzzy system is represented by approximate information concerning the next bend ahead the vehicle; the corresponding output is the cruise velocity that the vehicle needs to attain in order to safely drive on the path. To validate the proposed algorithm two completely different experiments have been run: in the first experiment, the vehicle has to perform a lane-following task acquiring lane information in real-time using an onboard camera; in the second, the motion of the vehicle is obtained assigning in real-time a given time law. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Temporal variation in the structure and location of dynamic ocean features make them challenging to observe. Beyond requiring sufficient persistence and speed of the sensor platform, effective observation is augmented by autonomous feature detection coupled with adaptive localization of mapping effort. These capabilities enable observations to remain localized within and around features of interest, thereby enhancing spatial and temporal resolution in their depiction. A Wave Glider is a wave-propelled unmanned surface vehicle with solar energy collection to support payload and a backup propeller in calm sea state. The efficiency of this platform enables persistence (months), and its propulsion system provides speed (similar to 1 m/s). Building on these capabilities, we aim at enabling the Wave Glider to autonomously recognize and track oceanic features that have strong surface expressions, accessible to near-surface sensors. We present a method of using a Wave Glider to autonomously track an oceanic thermal front known to have biological importance and dynamic evolution. In October 2017, this method was applied to tracking and mapping an upwelling front in Monterey Bay, CA, over 39 hr. The field result demonstrates adaptive localization of mapping based on autonomous feature detection.

AB In the context of autonomous navigation, the vehicle trajectory estimation and the detection of surrounding obstacles are two critical functionalities that must be robust to difficult environmental conditions (e.g., fog, dust, and snow) and the unavailability of infrastructure signals (e.g., GPS). With the advantage of remaining operable in low-visibility conditions, radar sensors are good candidates to detect obstacles in an autonomous navigation context. In this article, we show that radars can also be successfully used for real-time trajectory estimation. We address the case of an autonomous micro-drone intended for the exploration of piping networks and embedding a frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) multi-input multioutput (MIMO) radar. We show that using a beamforming technique to virtually steer the radar field of view (FOV), we can simultaneously estimate the horizontal and vertical velocities of the drone as well as its height. These results are first validated through simulations based on experimental drone flight data and a radar simulator. Then, using an Infineon 77-GHz FMCW radar, we show, through real-world experiments, the high performance attainable with our solution.

AB This paper studies the model evaluation and rapid deployment problems when the model trained by the source domain is deployed to multiple other target domains in autonomous driving application scenarios. To address the problem that the existing methods for evaluating model accuracy require complete labeled test sets, this paper proposes an instance segmentation model evaluation method based on domain differences, which can give the prediction accuracy of the model on unlabeled test sets. Furthermore, to address the rapid model deployment, this paper proposes a calculation method for the minimum number of supplements based on domain differences. The method selects the fewest images from the target domain scene and realizes the rapid deployment of the model through further annotation and training. Finally, experiments are conducted on the public dataset Cityscapes. The model evaluation experiments show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed method on Cityscapes is about 4% smaller (from 6% to 2%) than that of other existing model evaluation methods, and it can be as small as 2.35%. Rapid deployment experiments show that the RMSE of the proposed method on Cityscapes is about 8%.

AB In this paper, we address the estimation, control, navigation and mapping problems to achieve autonomous inspection of penstocks and tunnels using aerial vehicles with on-board sensing and computation. Penstocks and tunnels have the shape of a generalized cylinder. They are generally dark and featureless. State estimation is challenging because range sensors do not yield adequate information and cameras do not work in the dark. We show that the six degrees of freedom (DOF) pose and velocity can be estimated by fusing information from an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a lidar and a set of cameras. This letter discusses in detail the range-based estimation part while leaving the details of vision component to our earlier work. The proposed algorithm relies only on a model of the generalized cylinder and is robust to changes in shape of the tunnel. The approach is validated through real experiments showing autonomous and shared control, state estimation and environment mapping in the penstock at Center Hill Dam, TN. To our knowledge, this is the first time autonomous navigation and mapping has been achieved in a penstock without any external infrastructure such GPS or external cameras.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have become the most widely used tools for undertaking complex exploration tasks in marine environments. Their synthetic ability to carry out localization autonomously and build an environmental map concurrently, in other words, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), are considered to be pivotal requirements for AUVs to have truly autonomous navigation. However, the consistency problem of the SLAM system has been greatly ignored during the past decades. In this paper, a consistency constrained extended Kalman filter (EKF) SLAM algorithm, applying the idea of local consistency, is proposed and applied to the autonomous navigation of the C-Ranger AUV, which is developed as our experimental platform. The concept of local consistency (LC) is introduced after an explicit theoretical derivation of the EKF-SLAM system. Then, we present a locally consistency-constrained EKF-SLAM design, LC-EKF, in which the landmark estimates used for linearization are fixed at the beginning of each local time period, rather than evaluated at the latest landmark estimates. Finally, our proposed LC-EKF algorithm is experimentally verified, both in simulations and sea trials. The experimental results show that the LC-EKF performs well with regard to consistency, accuracy and computational efficiency.

AB This paper conducts a regenerative braking-based cabin thermal management by developing a hierarchical model predictive control (MPC) strategy. At the higher layer, an MPC controller is developed for optimally planning the vehicle speed. The lower layer implements cabin thermal management based on the planned regenerative braking behavior from the upper layer, where the recuperative energy can be used to directly power the air conditioning (AC) system. The state-space equation of a re-constructed power flow of vehicle is constructed, and based on which, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize energy consumption for battery aging-conscious control. Experiments are conducted to verify the performance of the hierarchical MPC strategy. Simulation results show that the vehicle drives in adaptation to the road topographies, the traffic flow and traffic signals in an energy-efficient way. The shifts of AC power load and cabin thermal load are caused so that the recuperative energy is fully used and the battery charging/discharging (aging) is minimized. Compared to the benchmark method, the energy consumption is reduced by 3.38% and the battery cycling aging is reduced by up to 29.15%.

ID DESIGN; ENERGY
AB Model predictive control (MPC) has been extensively utilized in the automotive applications, such as autonomous vehicle path planning and control, hybrid-vehicle energy management, and advanced driver-assistance system design. As a typical model-based control law, MPC relies on a system model to predict the state evolution of the manipulated plant within the prediction horizon. However, a representative yet concise mathematical description of the controlled plant may not always be available in practice. Therefore, model-free strategies, e.g., identification for control and direct data-driven control, have been incorporated into the predictive control framework. Nonetheless, existing model-free predictive controllers usually require reliable datasets and employ complex nonconvex optimizations to identify the underlying system model. Furthermore, their control performances are fundamentally limited by the quality of the training data. Inspired by the model-free control, this paper proposes the ultra-local model predictive control (ULMPC), which is a novel and straightforward model-free predictive control technique with no need for the computationally-extensive model learning process. The proposed ULMPC is implemented for automated vehicle trajectory following. Carsim-Simulink joint simulations and indoor experimental field tests with a scaled car demonstrate its effectiveness.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
AB This paper presents the preliminary results of a recent nationwide survey that focuses on mode choice behavior in view of emerging mobility options such as ride-sourcing and automated vehicles (AV). The survey provides a comprehensive scan of current mode choice patterns and the influencing factors. Then it presents stated preference (SP) choices to understand how travelers measure the trade-offs among different mode alternatives. The choice experiments focused on four potential user markets: drivers who usually drive for daily activities, passengers who depend on other household members or friends, transit users or users who do not have access to a private vehicle on a regular basis, and visitors or who do not have access to a private vehicle occasionally. The results suggest that on-demand services incorporating AV technologies (with lower operating costs) may become a viable option for many travelers. Most drivers and passengers preferred single ride than shared ride regardless of whether it is on a daily or occasional basis. However, for transit users, shared rides showed higher potential than exclusive services, which may indicate that cost is a primary consideration in the mode choice decisions for these users.

AB A system including Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and digital cartography is a good solution to carry out vehicle's,guidance. However, it has inconveniences like high sensibility to multipath and interference when the GPS signal is blocked by external agents. Another system is mandatory to avoid this error. This paper presents a cooperative system based on GPS and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) for automated vehicle position. The control system includes a decision unit to choose which value is the correct. In case GPS is working at top precision, it takes the control. On the other part, GPS signal can be lost and inertial control system guides the car in this occasion. A third possibility is contemplated: we receive the signal from GPS but the accuracy is over one meter. Now, position value is obtained by means of both systems. Experimental results analyze two situations: guidance in an urban area where GPS signal can be occluded by buildings or trees during short time intervals and the possibility of loss of the signal in long time to simulate the circulation in tunnels. Good results have been observed in tests and it demonstrates how a cooperative system improves the automated vehicle guidance.

AB The Amazon basin is one of the largest hydrographic systems in the world, possessing a great diversity of natural resources in need of more sustainable water and environmental management. However, as much of what lies beneath the surface of Amazonian waters is still unexplored, underwater exploration technologies are seen as a means of research and monitoring. The present work therefore aims to answer two research questions: What are the current technologies that could be implemented for unmanned underwater research in the Amazon waters? What are the main limitations and existing alternatives for using unmanned underwater vehicles in the rivers of this region to provide more sustainable water and environment management? Our results demonstrate that remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are possible options in the short and long terms, respectively. The main challenges in implementing these technologies are related to the variations in hydraulic geometry, current velocities and turbidity of the rivers, as well as the preservation of the region's biodiversity. This research can be taken as a starting point for planners and decision makers seeking more sustainable underwater and environmental exploration of the Amazon river system.

AB In obstacle avoidance trajectory planning, the environmental information collected by onboard and roadside sensors must be transmitted to the intelligent vehicle controller through network communication such as the CAN network and DSRC. However, the inherent network communication constraints such as delay and loss will lead to obstacle avoidance errors. To this end, a game deep Q-learning (GDQN) obstacle avoidance strategy is proposed combining deep Q-learning and the game theory reward strategy. The deep Q-learning network realises the modelling and description of the uncertainty of communication constraints. The obstacle avoidance reward strategy is presented by integrating the rules of traffic environment and vehicle dynamics. A scene preprocessing algorithm based on the artificial potential field method is proposed, which transforms the search problem of the optimal obstacle avoidance trajectory in the global scene into the search in the banded area to reduce the demand for computing power to the greatest extent. The experimental results show that compared with the existing research, the proposed method effectively solves the obstacle avoidance trajectory planning problem when the network has communication constraints and effectively balances traffic safety and vehicle stability in the process of obstacle avoidance.

AB Natural disasters often cause huge and unpredictable losses to human lives and properties. In such an emergency post-disaster rescue situation, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are effective tools to enter the damaged areas to perform immediate disaster recovery missions, owing to their flexible mobilities and fast deployment. However, UAVs typically have very limited battery and computational capacities, which makes them harder to perform heavy computation tasks during the complicated disaster recovery process. This paper addresses the issue of the battery and computation resource limitation with a fog computing based UAV system. Specifically, we first introduce the vehicular fog computing (VFC) system in which the unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) perform the computation tasks offloaded from UAVs. To avoid the transmission competitions yet enable cooperations among UAVs and UGVs, a stable matching algorithm is developed to transform the computation task offloading problem into a two-sided matching problem. An iterative algorithm is then developed which matches each UAV with the most suitable UGV for offloading. Finally, extensive simulations are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively improve utilities of UAVs and reduce average delay through comparison with conventional schemes.

AB Motion controllers usually require a tuning stage to ensure an acceptable performance of the vehicle during operation in challenging scenarios. However, such tuning stage is a time consuming process for the programmer and often is based on intuition or heuristic approaches. In addition, once tuned, the vehicle performance varies according to the nature of the terrain. In this work, we study the use of well-known probabilistic techniques for self-tuning trajectory tracking controllers for service units based on the idea of saving both vehicle's resources and human labour force time. The proposed strategies are based on Monte Carlo and Bayesian approaches to find the best set of gains to tune the controller both off-line and on-line, thus enhancing the controller performance in the presence of changing terrains. The approaches are implemented and validated on a skid-steer mini-loader vehicle usually used for mining purposes. Implementation details and both simulation and empirical results are included in this work, showing that when using our approaches, effort can be saved up to 30% and tracking errors reduced up to 75%.

AB Lane-level vehicle self-localization is a challenging and significant issue arising in autonomous driving and driver-assistance systems. The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and onboard inertial sensor integration are among the solutions for vehicle self-localization. However, as the main source in the integration, GNSS positioning performance is severely degraded in urban canyons because of the effects of multipath and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagations. These GNSS positioning errors also decrease the performance of the integration. To reduce the negative effects caused by GNSS positioning error, this paper proposes to employ an innovative GNSS positioning technique with the aid of a 3-D building map in the integration. The GNSS positioning result is used as an observation, and this is integrated with the information from the onboard inertial sensor and vehicle speedometer in a Kalman filter framework. To achieve stable performance, this paper proposes to evaluate and consider the accuracy of the employed GNSS positioning method in dynamic integration. A series of experiments in different scenarios is conducted in an urban canyon, which can demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using various evaluation and comparison processes.

AB This paper utilizes parallel control to investigate the problem of event-triggered deep reinforcement learning and develops an event-triggered deep Q-network (ETDQN) for decision-making of autonomous driving, without training an explicit triggering condition. Based on the framework of parallel control, the developed ETDQN incorporates information of actions into the feedback and constructs a dynamic control policy. First, in the realization of the dynamic control policy, we integrate the current state and the previous action to construct the augmented state as well as the augmented Markov decision process. Meanwhile, it is shown theoretically that the goal of the developed dynamic control policy is to learn the variation rate of the action. The augmented state contains information of the current state and the previous action, which enables the developed ETDQN to directly design the immediate reward considering communication loss. Then, based on dueling double deep Q-network (dueling DDQN), we establish the augmented action-value, value, and advantage functions to directly learn the optimal event-triggered decision-making policy of autonomous driving without an explicit triggering condition. It is worth noticing that the developed ETDQN applies to various deep Q-networks (DQNs). Empirical results demonstrate that, in event-triggered control, the developed ETDQN outperforms dueling DDQN and reduces communication loss effectively.

AB This article presents a method of generating grid maps for autonomous navigation using a geographic information system (GIS). Besides developing ordinary map systems, a GIS can be applicable to the terrain trafficability analysis for an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) by generating maps in which information about its spatial environment is encoded for path planning as part of autonomous navigation. For such maps, the most commonly used is a grid map over which a UGV's paths can be optimized. As the UGV moves and its situation changes, grid maps need to be generated quickly in an automatic manner for new paths. First of all, a GIS is analyzed to identify meaningful data, layers and attributes, which are then related to the UGV's navigation. For each grid in the grid map, every meaningful layer included is processed so that the set of values of attributes of the layer can be converted into the traverse cost. If multiple layers are included in a single grid, those traverse costs are fused and the result data is then replaced in the grid. Grid map generation is finished after all grids are filled with such costs. From test results using an experimental program, it is validated that the proposed method can be a viable tool for the timely generation of grid maps using a geographic information system for the UGV's autonomous navigation.

AB The paper considers an innovative model of autonomous charging stations where a program implementing a scheduling algorithm and a set of jobs being scheduled are driven by the same common power source. It is assumed that one of the well-known local search metaheuristics-an evolutionary algorithm-is used for the scheduling process. The algorithm is designed to search for a sequence of charging jobs resulting in a schedule of the minimum length. Since processors with variable processing speeds can be used for computations, this has interesting consequences both from a theoretical and practical point of view. It is shown in the paper that the problem of choosing the right processor speed under given constraints and an assumed scheduling criterion is a non-trivial one. We formulate a general problem of determining the computation speed of the evolutionary algorithm based on the proposed model of a computational task and the adopted problem of scheduling charging jobs. The novelty of the paper consists of two aspects: (i) proposing the new model of the autonomous charging station operating according to the basics of edge computing; and (ii) developing the methodology for dynamically changing the computational speed, taking into account power and energy constraints as well as the results of computations obtained in the current iteration of the algorithm. Some approaches for selecting the appropriate speed of computations are proposed and discussed. Conclusions and possible directions for future research are also given.

AB Almost all flying creatures, from centimeter scale insects to meter-scale birds, maneuver through flapping-wing propulsion. Development of flapping-wing robots capable of long-term autonomous flight remains an ongoing challenge owing to manufacturing, actuation, and control considerations. In this article, we report the design and the control system of an all servo-driven bird-like flapping-wing aerial robot called USTBird. Different from most common flapping mechanisms combining gear transmission and motor, USTBird is driven by two independently programmable servos, which makes the wingbeat kinematics of USTBird diverse and enables it to do some agile aerobatic maneuvers. The enhanced controllability brought by the servo-driven method allows USTBird to produce both flight force and control force relying solely on the flapping wings, and exert decoupled control torques about all three body axes without a controllable tail. The flapping gait optimization problem is considered for USTBird, and three different kinds of drive signals are compared for larger aerodynamic forces generation. Toward practical applications, an outdoor flight task of autonomous patrol around a building, which can be subdivided into a coordinated takeoff and a low-altitude patrol and reconnaissance, is conducted on the robot with a good performance.

AB Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication applications face significant challenges to security and privacy since all types of possible breaches are common in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) networks. As an inheritance from conventional wireless services, potential eavesdropping is one of the main threats to V2V communications. In our work, the anti-eavesdropping scheme in CAVs networks is developed through the use of cognitive risk control (CRC)-based vehicular joint radar-communication (JRC) system. In particular, the supplement of off-board measurements acquired using V2V links to the perceptual information has presented the potential to enhance the traffic target positioning precision. Then, transmission power control is performed utilizing reinforcement learning, the result of which is determined by a task switcher. Based on the threat evaluation, a multiple armed bandit problem is designed to implement the secret key switching procedure when it is needed. Through constant perception-execution loops (PELs), the security and confidentiality is improved for the authorized vehicles in their behavioral interactions with the illegal eavesdropper. Numerical experiments have presented that the developed approach has anticipated performance in terms of some risk assessment indicators.

AB Swarms of unmanned vehicles (air and ground) can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of military and law enforcement operations by enhancing situational awareness and allowing the persistent monitoring of multiple hostile targets. The key focus in the development of the enabling technologies for swarm systems is the minimisation of uncertainties in situational awareness information for surveillance operations supported by 'system of systems' composed of static and mobile heterogeneous sensors. The identified critical enabling techniques and technologies for adaptive, informative and reconfigurable operations of unmanned swarm systems are robust static sensor network design, mobile sensor tasking (including re-allocation), sensor fusion and information fusion, including behaviour monitoring. The work presented in this paper describes one of the first attempts to integrate all swarm-related technologies into a prototype, demonstrating the benefits of swarms of heterogeneous vehicles for defence applications used for the persistent monitoring of high-value assets, such as military installations and camps. The key enabling swarm system technologies are analysed here, and novel algorithms are presented that can be implemented in available COTS-based unmanned vehicles. The algorithms have been designed and optimised to require small computational power, be flexible, be reconfigurable and be implemented in a large range of commercially available unmanned vehicles (air and ground).

AB This paper presents a new approach for designing simple nonlinear robust controllers for underwater vehicles. The paper presents several in-water experiments performed on the VORTEX vehicle developed by IFREMER. We first introduce some general modeling considerations of underwater vehicles, then we present the VORTEX dynamic model and some of the special features of the VORTEX vehicle that are important for control. Among these, low sampling rates for sensor and actuator nonlinearities are considered. The main aim of this paper is to experimentally investigate the benefits of adding an easy-to-tune nonlinear control loop to the actual linear compensator in order to improve the stability and the disturbance rejection properties of the closed-loop system. The advantage of this method is two-fold. First the additional nonlinear loop does not modify the original linear (PID) regulator. Second the design of this additional loop does not rely on the system model and is simple to tune. The results presented in this paper were obtained using the VORTEX vehicle both in simulation and during real experiments; they demonstrate the advantages of using a PID with this nonlinear loop over a simple PID control.

AB How should the autonomous car behave when faced with an unavoidable fatal accident? The answer may vary depending on the perspective from which the choice is made. If people answer this question as a driver, choosing a car that prioritizes the driver's safety looks egocentric, and choosing a car that prioritizes pedestrians' safety looks altruistic. On the other hand, if people's attitudes change depending on whether one's choice is visible to others, this time that looks hypocritic if they tend to choose the pedestrian-first car when others can see the choice. At the same time, these answers may also vary culturally. However, if there are such cultural differences, that should affect the policies of governments, lawmakers, car manufacturers, and marketers. To investigate people's safety preference from the driver's perspective and their possible hypocritic tendencies, together with its possible cultural variance, this study conducted a survey (N = 683) with Japanese, Chinese, and American participants. The result indicated some interesting and unexpected cultural differences in their answers, which should provide valuable new data for future discussions on the issues surrounding autonomous cars.

ID PLATFORM
AB In recent years, engineering degree programs have become fundamental to the teaching of robotics and incorporate many fundamental STEM concepts. Some authors have proposed different platforms for teaching different topics related to robotics, but most of these platforms are not practical for classroom use. In the case of teaching autonomous navigation algorithms, the absence of platforms in classrooms limits learning because students are unable to perform practice activities or cannot evaluate and compare different navigation algorithms. The main contribution of this study is the implementation of a free platform for teaching autonomous-driving algorithms based on the Robot Operating System without the use of a physical robot. The authors present a case study using this platform as a teaching tool for instruction in two undergraduate robotic courses. Students evaluated the platform quantitatively and qualitatively. Our study demonstrates that professors and students can carry out different tests and compare different navigation algorithms to analyze their performance under the same conditions in class. In addition, the proposed platform provides realistic representations of environments and data visualizations. The results claim that the use of simulations helps students better understand the theoretical concepts, motivates them to pay attention, and increases their confidence.

ID ILLUMINATION
AB We propose a method to change the shadows cast by vehicles based on unpaired data, which is used to solve the problem of insufficient datasets for target detection in autonomous driving scenarios. This method can increase the training samples of road vehicles in different time periods and reduce the time needed to make complex annotations of datasets. Direct use of generative adversarial networks with cycle-consistency constraints can achieve mapping transformation of unpaired domains, but it is difficult to completely learn the mapping between different shadow domains. To solve this problem, V-ShadowGAN is proposed. First, to train the model, we construct an unpaired dataset of vehicle shadows in different time periods. Second, the shadow mask extractor and the shadow mask discriminator are constructed to extract shadow masks and guide the generation of shadows in the network. Finally, the spatial attention mechanism is added to the generator, which improves the overall quality of the generated image by changing the channel weight of the network and deepening the network. Various experiments show that V-ShadowGAN can effectively change the vehicle shadow. (C) 2022 SPIE and IS&T

AB Automated driving technology along with electric propulsion are widely expected to fundamentally change our transport systems. They may not only allow a more productive use of travel time, but will likely trigger completely new business models in the mobility market. A key determinant of the future prospects of both existing and new mobility services will be their production costs. Hence, in this research the production costs of various transport modes both today and in an automated-electric future are analyzed. To account for different local contexts, the study is conducted for 17 cities across the globe. The results indicate that high-income countries will benefit the most from vehicle automation, while only smaller changes can be expected in lower-income countries. This is due to the different relative contribution of labor cost to the total cost of current taxi and bus operations. In a likely final state, transportation costs will be largely decoupled from a country's income level, which will favor productivity in higher-income locations. While this research provides valuable first insights into potential future developments, the underlying assumptions will need to be updated as better information becomes available.

ID DRIVER BEHAVIOR
AB The concept of stimuli-induced equilibrium point (SIEP) has been recently introduced to characterize the psychological interaction of a ramp driver with its putative leader and follower on the expressway during a merging maneuver. It enables the computation of the reference target gap speed and position for the on-ramp merging vehicle based on current traffic conditions and ramp vehicle response. The SIEP has been shown to improve the performance of existing automatic ramp merging control strategies while increasing the level of safety during the merging maneuver. The performance and advantages of the SIEP-based approach have been assessed only through numerical simulations. In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive experimental evaluation of the performance and safety of this SIEP-based approach to ramp merging control using a lab-based test-bed. We employed a novel Pc metric, which is based on the concept of probability of collision, to perform a systematic validation of the SIEP safety. Such a metric serves as a standardized methodology to quantitatively compare the SIEP-based approach with those in this paper.

AB An analysis was performed to estimate the potential national costs and benefits of cooperative vehicle and roadway measures to enhance the effectiveness of driver assistance systems. These cooperative measures-query-response communication systems, fight-emitting-diode brake light messaging, radar cross-section paint-striping modifications, fluorescent paint for land and other marking applications, passive amplifiers on license plates, spatial tetrahedral arrays of reflectors, and in-vehicle corner cubes-are briefly described, along with assumptions that were made regarding performance. For the example lane departure case, the incremental nationwide effectiveness over an autonomous collision-avoidance system is estimated and monetized. This was generally determined with respect to annual crash-reduction savings, although the technique used allows other mobility benefits to be considered. The marginal benefits of providing each sensor-friendly technology were then calculated and aggregated across the various Intelligent Vehicle Initiative services so that a total marginal benefit was determined for each technology. Complementing this, a method has been established to estimate the magnitude of at- and near-intersection lead-vehicle-not-moving crashes for these technologies. Together, these methods illustrate national benefits across all crash types (the three-step process) and a more focused means to estimate benefits for a particular crash type (rear-end collisions at or near intersections)-and provide a composite approach to the problem.

TI An Autonomous Water Monitoring and Sampling System for Small-Sized ASVs

AB In recent years, sensorized autonomous vehicles (either AUVs or ASVs) have been increasingly used for in situ water measurements. However, collection of water samplings at depth by small-sized ASVs and their subsequent physical/chemical analysis onboard remains difficult due to size and weight constraints. This paper addresses this issue and describes the design and testing of an autonomous water monitoring and sampling system intended for operations onboard small-sized man-portable ASVs. The system is designed to collect water samples up to 50 m in depth and to measure physical water parameters along the water column. The system is composed of a probe lowered by a winch measuring physical water parameters and able to collect water samples at different selectable depths. Once the probe is returned onboard, a water distribution system transfers the collected water samples to sensors lodged in the ASV for the monitoring of chemical parameters, or into containers to transport the samples to laboratories on the mainland. The system combines small dimensions, self-cleaning capabilities, low weight, and limited power consumption allowing it to be easily installable and used on an autonomous small-sized ASVs. The sampling system was installed and tested in a robotic small-sized catamaran belonging to the HydroNet ASV class.

AB Unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV) are widely used tools in ocean development, which can be applied in areas such as marine scientific research, ocean resources exploration, and ocean security. However, as ocean exploration advances, UUVs face increasingly challenging operational environments with weaker communication signals. Consequently, autonomous obstacle avoidance planning for UUVs becomes increasingly important. With the deepening of ocean exploration, the operational environment of UUVs has become increasingly difficult to access, and the communication signals in the environment have become weaker. Therefore, autonomous obstacle avoidance planning of UUVs has become increasingly important. Traditional dynamic programming methods face challenges in terms of accuracy and real-time performance, requiring the design of auxiliary strategies to achieve ideal avoidance and requiring cumbersome perception equipment to support them. Therefore, exploring an efficient and easy-to-implement dynamic programming method has significant theoretical and practical value. In this study, an LSTM-RNN network structure suitable for UUVs was designed to learn the dynamic programming mode of UUVs in an unknown environment. The research was divided into three main aspects: collecting the required sample dataset for training deep networks, designing the LSTM-RNN network structure, and utilizing LSTM-RNN to achieve dynamic programming. Experimental results demonstrated that LSTM-RNN can learn planning patterns in unknown environments without the need for constructing an environment model or complex perception devices, thus providing significant theoretical and practical value. Consequently, this approach offers an effective solution for autonomous obstacle avoidance planning for UUVs.

AB With the development of AI, the intelligence level of vehicles is increasing. Structured roads, as common and important traffic scenes, are the most typical application scenarios for realizing autonomous driving. The driving behavior decision-making of intelligent vehicles has always been a controversial and difficult research topic. Currently, the mainstream decision-making methods, which are mainly based on rules, lack adaptability and generalization to the environment. Aimed at the particularity of intelligent vehicle behavior decisions and the complexity of the environment, this thesis proposes an intelligent vehicle driving behavior decision method based on DQN generative adversarial imitation learning (DGAIL) in the structured road traffic environment, in which the DQN algorithm is utilized as a GAIL generator. The results show that the DGAIL method can preserve the design of the reward value function, ensure the effectiveness of training, and achieve safe and efficient driving on structured roads. The experimental results show that, compared with A3C, DQN and GAIL, the model based on DGAIL spends less average training time to achieve a 95% success rate in the straight road scene and merging road scene, respectively. Apparently, this algorithm can effectively accelerate the selection of actions, reduce the randomness of actions during the exploration, and improve the effect of the decision-making model.

AB Today's self-driving vehicles have achieved impressive driving capabilities, but still suffer from uncertain performance in long-tail cases. Training a reinforcement-learning-based self-driving algorithm with more data does not always lead to better performance, which is a safety concern. Here we present a dynamic confidence-aware reinforcement learning (DCARL) technology for guaranteed continuous improvement. Continuously improving means that more training always improves or maintains its current performance. Our technique enables performance improvement using the data collected during driving, and does not need a lengthy pre-training phase. We evaluate the proposed technology both using simulations and on an experimental vehicle. The results show that the proposed DCARL method enables continuous improvement in various cases, and, in the meantime, matches or outperforms the default self-driving policy at any stage. This technology was demonstrated and evaluated on the vehicle at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games.
   Reinforcement learning is a powerful technique to learn complex behaviours, but in the context of self-driving vehicles it might result in unsafe behaviour in previously unseen situations. Cao et al. create a confidence-aware method that improves through reinforcement learning but reverts to safe behaviour when a situation is new.

AB This paper aims to review the state of the art of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors for automotive applications, and particularly for automated vehicles, focusing on recent advances in the field of integrated LiDAR, and one of its key components: the Optical Phased Array (OPA). LiDAR is still a sensor that divides the automotive community, with several automotive companies investing in it, and some companies stating that LiDAR is a useless appendix. However, currently there is not a single sensor technology able to robustly and completely support automated navigation. Therefore, LiDAR, with its capability to map in 3 dimensions (3D) the vehicle surroundings, is a strong candidate to support Automated Vehicles (AVs). This manuscript highlights current AV sensor challenges, and it analyses the strengths and weaknesses of the perception sensor currently deployed. Then, the manuscript discusses the main LiDAR technologies emerging in automotive, and focuses on integrated LiDAR, challenges associated with light beam steering on a chip, the use of Optical Phased Arrays, finally discussing current factors hindering the affirmation of silicon photonics OPAs and their future research directions.

AB The problem of generating smooth parallel parking maneuver for autonomous car-like vehicles is considered, wherein the vehicle moves forward from the starting point to an intermediate point and then traces a path backward to the parking position. Any error in accurately reaching the intermediate point leads to maneuver replanning and hence puts extra computational burden on the planner. Addressing the issue, this letter formulates the problem in a point-to-ray framework connecting the parking position to all points in a neighborhood of the intermediate point. Exploiting its asymptotic convergence, four parameter logistic (4PL) curve based S-shaped path is proposed as a solution with a single maneuver connecting the intermediate point neighborhood to the parking position. Inherent to the 4PL curve, the maneuver presents a continuous steering profile with zero steering angle at the ends. Parking slot collision avoidance and steering limit of the vehicle are satisfied by deducing closed-form analytic conditions on the two design parameters. Together with the robustness to intermediate point variation, comparison with existing approaches highlights computational and design advantages. The proposed approach is validated using a double-tracked Ackermann steering vehicle model.

AB The automotive industry is undergoing a massive transformation, driven by the mega-trends of "CASE": connected, autonomous, shared, and electric. These trends are affecting the nature of automobiles, both internally and externally. Internally, the transition from internal combustion engines (ICE) to electric drive-trains has resulted in a shift from hardware-centric vehicles to software-defined vehicles (SDVs), where software is increasingly becoming the dominant asset in the automotive value chain. These trends are leading to new design challenges such as how to manage different configurations of design, how to decouple the design of software and services from hardware, and how to design hardware to allow for upgrades. Externally, automobiles are no longer isolated products. Instead, they are part of the larger digital ecosystem with cloud connectivity. Vehicle usage data are increasingly connected with smart factories, which create new opportunities for agile product development and mass customization of features. The role of the human driver is also changing with increasing levels of autonomy features. In this paper, the authors discuss the ongoing transformation in the automotive industry and its implications for engineering design. The paper presents a road map for engineering design research for next-generation automotive applications.

AB The actual performance of a task-assignment method of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) shows a considerable dependence on the path planning process coupled with it; however, this topic has been rarely studied in the existing literature. This article considers the problem of maximizing the task-assignment reward of a fleet of heterogeneous UAVs for a dynamic reconnaissance and confirmation task under constraints of critical time and multi-UAV tasks where the coupled path optimization objectives also need to be considered. The existing consensus-based bundle algorithm is extended with an effective method for managing the multitask and multiagent constraints. The proposed method can optimize the inherent coupling path using the Dubins path to reduce the differences between the estimated path and the actual path, shortening the operation time by adopting the distributed genetic algorithm. The proposed method is verified by the sample run tests of a disaster area reconnaissance and confirmation task and Monte Carlo comparison simulations with the two existing algorithms. The results verify both the practicality and advantages of the proposed method.

AB The deployment of automated vehicles (AVs) has the potential to disrupt and fundamentally transform urban transportation. As their implementation becomes imminent on cities' streets, it is of great concern that no comprehensive strategies have been formulated to effectively manage and mitigate their potential negative impacts, particularly with respect to the components of the do no significant harm (DNSH) framework recently introduced in the EU taxonomy. The methodology employed comprises three steps: (i) An extensive literature review on the impact of AVs on the DNSH components; (ii) exploration of designing a coherent pro-active vision by integrating measures identified in the literature as key elements to mitigate the harm; and (iii) an interdisciplinary focus group (FG) to verify whether the impacts of AVs and potential mitigation measures for Bucharest are similar to those identified by the literature and integrated into the pro-active vision. The results suggest that while there are commonalities, variations exist in focus and perspective, underscoring the necessity of examining the mitigation measures encompassed in the vision through additional focus groups conducted in different cities.

AB Vehicle platooning has become a topic of substantial interest for development of safer and more efficient means of transportation. It is described as a string of connected autonomous vehicles traveling closely, maintaining certain inter-vehicular distances at a set speed boosting the road capacity, improving safety and lowering adverse environmental significance. In this study, several platooning concepts addressed in previous literature are revealed. A unified integrated platoon control architecture is constructed, employing the aforementioned concepts. This architecture contemplates a generic decoupled longitudinal and lateral engine-based vehicle model incorporating the powertrain dynamics. Several control algorithms are investigated, optimized and compared to manage the longitudinal inter-vehicular spacing distances of a formed platoon, as well as the lateral platoon motion tracking. The superior longitudinal controller in terms of spacing error convergence, velocity tracking and acceptable control effort, in addition to the outperformed lateral controller for its accurate lane change tracking and lower computational cost are promoted to be tested in the integrated architecture. Simulations are visualized using the Multi-Robot Systems Intelligent Transportation Systems (MRS-ITS) visualization tool for further realization of the results.

AB This article investigates a distributed fuzzy adaptive formation control for quadrotor multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) under unmodeled dynamics and switching topologies. The UAVs dynamics model is described by the Newton-Euler formula, and the actuator faults are considered in the system model in the form of multiplicative factors and additive factors. Due to the underactuated characteristics of the UAVs, two objective attitude commands are generated by designing a virtual control signal, which are transmitted to the attitude subsystem, and then the position controller is solved. By constructing a distributed communication mechanism between UAVs, an adaptive formation control strategy is proposed, which can enable UAVs to update their position and speed online according to their neighbor information, and then achieve the required formation. In addition, a fuzzy adaptive sliding mode controller is designed to ensure that the tracking errors of UAVs converge to the neighborhood of the origin. Finally, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

AB The analytical research has recently indicated that the computational resources of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) have been wasted since almost all vehicles spend over 95% of their time in parking lots. This paper presents a collaborative computing framework to efficiently offload online computational tasks to parked vehicles (PVs) during peak business hours. To maintain the service continuity, we advocate for integrating Kubernetes-based container orchestration to leverage its advanced features (e.g., auto-healing, load balancing, and security). We analytically formulate the task-offloading problem and then propose an intelligent meta-heuristic algorithm to dynamically deal with online heterogeneous demands. Additionally, we take a cumulative incentives model into account, where the PV owners are able to earn profit by sharing their computation resources. We also compare our algorithm with several existent heuristics on different sizes of the parking lot. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed computing framework significantly increases the possibility of accepting the online tasks and improves average task offloading cost by at least 40%. Besides, we quantify the PV availability by task acceptance ratios, which can be a critical criterion for network planners to achieve desired network service goals.

AB This article presents a different type of home energy management algorithm for a residence consisting of solar PV, battery storage units, electric vehicles with different driving profiles, critical and noncritical loads. The primary objective of the proposed methodology is to reduce the overall power purchase from the utility. In order to achieve the said objectives a combination of the rule based approach proposed by the authors and a heuristic optimization is used. Hence, it can be said that the proposed strategy consists of two layers, of which the first part of the algorithm schedules the noncritical loads using electric springs and the second part of the strategy controls battery storage units and electric vehicles. The novelty of the proposed work lies in using electric springs, battery storage units and exploring the virtual energy storage capabilities of electric vehicles so as to make the residential complexes more autonomous and less dependent on the utility. The robustness of the proposed strategy is tested on a residence and from the obtained results it can be said that the presented algorithm can save an electricity bill of about 53% to the consumer.

AB The Orbiting Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem (ODTSP) is to plan a minimum-time tour for a Dubins vehicle model to inspect a set of targets in the plane by orbiting each target along a circular arc. This problem arises in underwater minehunting, where targets are mine-like objects on the sea bottom that are inspected by a sonar-equipped underwater vehicle. Each orbit subtends a prescribed angle so that the target's acoustic response is measured from a variety of target-sensor relative geometries to aid in classifying it. ODTSP tours consist of circular-arc orbits joined by Dubins paths, and the optimization problem is to partition the set of targets into orbits and determine the position, radius, direction, and vehicle entry angle of each. Algorithms are presented for the restricted case, where each orbit inspects a single target (only), and the general case, where orbits inspect multiple targets. The approach is facilitated by analytical conditions that identify admissible clusters of targets as cliques of a disk graph. The ODTSP is extended to consider path planning in the presence of a steady uniform current.

AB This work investigates the secrecy issues for the secrecy reconfigurable intelligent surface-based integrated satellite unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relay networks with multiple vehicle eavesdroppers. Particularly, the maximal ratio combining (MRC) eavesdropping is utilized to overhear the legitimate signal information. The UAV is applied to forward the legitimate signal to the destination user. Reconfigurable intelligent surface is applied to ensure the transmission. Relied on the proposed secrecy system model and MRC eavesdropping scheme, this paper gets the detailed investigations for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) through the whole signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) to valuate the effects of important parameters on the SOP. Moreover, to achieve the further impacts of main parameters on the SOP at high SNRs, the approximate analysis for the SOP is also gotten together with the secrecy diversity order (SDO) and secrecy coding gain (SCG). At last, several typical Monte Carlo (MC) results are obtained to present the rightness of obtained theoretical analysis.

AB In this article, the resilient unscented Kalman filtering fusion issue is investigated for a class of nonlinear systems under the dynamic event-triggered mechanism where each sensor node transmits the measurement information to its corresponding local filter in an intermittent way. Compared with its static counterpart, the dynamic event-triggered scheme is capable of scheduling the frequency of data transmission in a more efficient way, thereby better reducing communication burden and energy consumption. In addition, for each local filter, the variation of the filter gain is characterized by a multiplicative noise term. To cope with the intractable problem of computing the cross covariance between local filters, the sequential covariance intersection fusion strategy is introduced into the proposed distributed fusion framework. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to a maneuvering target tracking scenario with multiple unmanned aerial vehicles, and both numerical simulations and hardware experiments are provided to elucidate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed filtering scheme.

AB Vehicle sharing, automation, and electrification are anticipated to move mobility and society towards low carbon and sustainability. Yet their positives and negatives to the society and natural environment largely depend on how people response to them which is poorly understood. A systematic review is performed in this study to discuss the modeling approaches that quantify travel behavior and demand implications of those technologies and summarize the pros-and-cons of the state-of-the-art. Evidences suggest that the negative rebound effect of the technologies lack mature discussion and require comprehensive quantification multidimensionally in technology adoption, trip generation, timing, travel distance, mode shift, and urban sprawl. Meanwhile, it is worth addressing the uncertainties of the net impact of the technologies resulted from data quality, population and regional heterogeneity, level of vehicle automation, temporal dynamics, behavior chain reactions, and societal issues like aging, fertility drop, and the pandemic. The findings of this review will enlighten the future endeavors of improving the estimation of mobility demand, energy, and carbon emissions implications of the innovative mobility technologies.

AB Recently, many artificial intelligence applications in smart cars have been utilized in real life. Making an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) capable of moving autonomously has become a critical topic. Hence, in this work, a novel method for a UGV to realize path planning and obstacle avoidance is presented using a deep deterministic policy gradient approach (DDPG). More specifically, the lidar sensor mounted on the vehicle is utilized to measure the distance between the vehicle and the surrounding obstacles, and the odometer measures the mileage of the vehicle for the purpose of estimating the current location. Then, the above sensed data are treated as the training data for the DDPG training procedure, and several experiments are performed in different settings utilizing the robot operating system (ROS) and the Gazebo simulator with a real robot module, TurtleBot3, to present a comprehensive discussion. The simulation results show that using the presented design and reward architecture, the DDPG method is better than the classic deep Q-network (DQN) method, e.g., taking fewer steps to reach the goal, less training time to find the smallest number of steps for reaching the goal, and so on.

AB The purpose of this research is to develop a high-efficiency, low-cost, and easy-to-use tracking system for vehicles, and it is expected that the system can be extended to areas such as service robots, autonomous driving, and manufacturing. In this paper, we introduced an object detection algorithm based on convolutional neural networks to realize face recognition, which has better efficiency and robustness than traditional machine learning methods. With the concept of edge computing, we deployed the model on the local embedded system to improve the information transmission and security issues of cloud computing. In order to realize the tracking system, this paper builds a mecanum-wheel vehicle with omnidirectional mobility, and proposes a parallel-cascade PID controller architecture based on the mecanum-wheel vehicle. The fixed distance linear tracking control can be realized through the dual-loop feedback control of distance and yaw angle; moreover, the vehicle slipping which is caused by difference rotation speed can be improved. Finally, through algorithm optimization, controller parameter adjustment, and system integration, an omnidirectional mobile vehicle with recognition and tracking functions is realized. The experiment results indicate that the system is stable and robust during actual operation.

AB In this paper, a cooperative optimization strategy is proposed for velocity planning and energy management of intelligent connected plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Based on the established vehicle model, a mathematical analytical method is investigated to convert the driving cycles from the original time based profiles to the driving distance based speed values. Then, the iterative dynamic programming is exploited to achieve the synergistic optimization in terms of speed planning and power allocation of the vehicle with the con-sideration of gear shifting limits and speed fluctuation. To meet the requirement of trip duration limitation which may be violated due to autonomous speed planning, the termi-nal driving time is constrained by adding a time adjustment factor to the cost function. The simulation results suggest that the proposed strategy attains the collaborative opti-mization with high efficiency in terms of speed planning and driving power distribution. In addition, the proposed strategy leads to significant reduction of the energy consumption cost under the constraints of allowed speed variation ranges.

AB The containment maneuvering of marine surface vehicles has two objectives. The first one is to force the marine vehicles to follow a convex hull spanned by multiple parameterized paths. The second one is to meet the requirement of a desired dynamic behavior along multiple paths during containment. A modular design approach to the containment maneuvering of marine surface vehicles is presented. At first, an estimator module using a recurrent neural network is proposed to estimate the unknown kinetics induced by model uncertainty, unmodeled dynamics, and environmental disturbances. Next, a controller module is developed based on a distributed path maneuvering design and a linear tracking differentiator. Finally, two path update laws based on a maneuvering error feedback and a filtering update scheme, respectively, are constructed. The estimator-controller pair forms a cascade system, which is proved to be input-to-state stable. The developed controller has a desirable spatial-temporal decoupling property, and geometric and dynamic objectives can be achieved separately. Results of comparative studies are provided to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method.

AB Low-speed driving in traffic jams causes significant pollution and wasted time for commuters. Additionally, from the passengers' standpoint, this is an uncomfortable, stressful and tedious scene that is suitable to be automated. The highly nonlinear dynamics of car engines at low-speed turn its automation in a complex problem that still remains as unsolved. Considering the hybrid nature of the vehicle longitudinal control at low-speed, constantly switching between throttle and brake pedal actions, hybrid control is a good candidate to solve this problem.
   This work presents the analytical formulation of a hybrid predictive controller for automated low-speed driving. It takes advantage of valuable characteristics supplied by predictive control strategies both for compensating un-modeled dynamics and for keeping passengers security and comfort analytically by means of the treatment of constraints. The proposed controller was implemented in a gas-propelled vehicle to experimentally validate the adopted solution. To this end, different scenarios were analyzed varying road layouts and vehicle speeds within a private test track. The production vehicle is a commercial Citroen C3 Pluriel which has been modified to automatically act over its throttle and brake pedals. (C) 2015 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Vehicle-to-driver takeover will still be needed in semi-autonomous vehicles. Due to the complexity of the takeover process, it is important to develop interfaces to support good takeover performance. Multimodal displays have been proposed as a candidate for the design of takeover requests (TORs), but many questions remain unanswered regarding the effectiveness of this approach. This study investigated the effects of takeover signal direction (ipsilateral vs. contralateral), lead time (4 vs. 7 s), and modality (uni-, bi-, and trimodal combinations of visual, auditory, and tactile signals) on automated vehicle takeover performance. Twenty-four participants rode in a simulated SAE Level 3 vehicle and performed a series of takeover tasks when presented with a TOR. Overall, single and multimodal signals with a tactile component were correlated with the faster takeover and information processing times, and were perceived as most useful. Ipsilateral signals showed a marginally significant benefit to takeover times compared to contralateral signals. Finally, a shorter lead time was associated with faster takeover times, but also poorer takeover quality. Findings from this study can inform the design of in-vehicle information and warning systems for next-generation transportation.

AB Localization is the fundamental problem of intelligent vehicles. For a vehicle to autonomously operate, it first needs to locate itself in the environment. A lot of different odometries (visual, inertial, wheel encoders) have been introduced through the past few years for autonomous vehicle localization. However, such odometries suffers from drift due to their reliance on integration of sensor measurements. In this paper, the drift error in an odometry is modeled and a Drift Covariance Estimation (DCE) algorithm is introduced. The DCE algorithm estimates the covariance of an odometry using the readings of another on-board sensor which does not suffer from drift. To validate the proposed algorithm, several real-world experiments in different conditions as well as sequences from Oxford RobotCar Dataset and EU long-term driving dataset are used. The effect of the covariance estimation on three different fusion-based localization algorithms (EKF, UKF and EH-infinity) is studied in comparison with the use of constant covariance, which were calculated based on the true variance of the sensors being used. The obtained results show the efficacy of the estimation algorithm compared to constant covariances in terms of improving the accuracy of localization.

AB Cloud computing in VANETs (CC-V) has been investigated into two major themes of research including vehicular cloud computing (VCC) and vehicle using cloud (VuC). VCC is the realization of autonomous cloud among vehicles to share their abundant resources. VuC is the efficient usage of conventional cloud by on-road vehicles via a reliable Internet connection. Recently, a number of advancements have been made to address the issues and challenges in VCC and VuC. This paper qualitatively reviews CC-V with the emphasis on layered architecture, network component, taxonomy, and future challenges. Specifically, a four-layered architecture for CC-V is proposed including perception, coordination, artificial intelligence and smart application layers. Three network components of CC-V, namely, vehicle, connection, and computation are explored with their cooperative roles. A taxonomy for CC-V is presented considering major themes of research in the area including design of architecture, data dissemination, security, and applications. Related literature on each theme is critically investigated with comparative assessment of recent advances. Finally, some open research challenges are identified as future issues. The challenges are the outcome of the critical and qualitative assessment of the literature on CC-V.

AB The transition from today's mostly human-driven traffic to a purely automated one will be a gradual evolution, with the effect that we will likely experience mixed traffic in the near future. Connected and automated vehicles can benefit human-driven ones and the whole traffic system in different ways, for example by improving collision avoidance and reducing traffic waves. Many studies have been carried out to improve intersection management, a significant bottleneck in traffic, with intelligent traffic signals or exclusively automated vehicles. However, the problem of how to improve mixed traffic at unsignalized intersections has received less attention. In this letter, we propose a novel approach to optimizing traffic flow at intersections in mixed traffic situations using deep reinforcement learning. Our reinforcement learning agent learns a policy for a centralized controller to let connected autonomous vehicles at unsignalized intersections give up their right of way and yield to other vehicles to optimize traffic flow. We implemented our approach and tested it in the traffic simulator SUMO based on simulated and real traffic data. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method significantly improves traffic flow through unsignalized intersections in mixed traffic settings and also provides better performance in a wide range of traffic situations compared to the state of the art.

AB In this study, a model predictive path tracking control method based on the prediction of tire state stiffness is proposed to improve the path tracking performance at the limit of vehicle dynamics. Considering the influence of the nonlinear properties of tire force on vehicle dynamics, a nonlinear UniTire model is established, based on which a state stiffness 3D look-up table is designed to linearize the nonlinear tire model. The tire state stiffness in the prediction horizon is predicted by the vehicle motion model using the reference path information. A new linear time-varying path tracking control model in the prediction horizon is designed based on the predicted tire state stiffness. A nonlinear model predictive controller and a traditional linear time-varying model predictive controller are also designed and compared with the proposed method to verify the effectiveness and advantage of the latter. Results clearly show an improved control performance of the proposed method compared with the traditional method under the limit condition. Moreover, the calculation speed of the proposed method is faster than that of the nonlinear model predictive control method.

AB To decrease traffic accidents is a declared target of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Among them, rear-end collisions are one of the most common and constitute one of the as yet unsolved topics in the automotive sector. This paper presents an approach to the avoidance of rear-end collisions in congested traffic situations. To this end, two fuzzy controllers, a Collision Warning System (CWS) and a Collision Avoidance System (CAS), have been developed. The former is in charge of alerting the driver in case of an impending rear-end collision to prevent or mitigate the crash. The latter is in charge of generating an output control signal for the steering wheel in order to avoid the collision. Both CWS and CAS have been tested with real cars using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications to acquire data of vehicles. A system installed in the infrastructure capable of assessing road traffic conditions in real time is responsible for transmitting the data of the vehicles in the surrounding area. The systems have been tested at the Center for Automation and Robotics (CAR)'s facilities with two mass-produced cars. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; EMERGENCY BRAKING
AB This paper presents the model predictive control (MPC) based multifunctional advanced driver-assistance system (MADAS) that is optimized for rear-end collision avoidance. First, the system's operation is judged by considering the driver's intention of avoidance and the possibility of avoiding obstacle vehicles. Once the system is activated, the lateral tire force corresponding to the driver's steering input, which is essential for collision avoidance, is realized with the highest priority. The use of each tire friction circle is then maximized by utilizing available tire forces for braking through quadratic programming. While the MADAS ensures the lateral maneuver and deceleration of the vehicle, the system still can generate additional yaw moment calculated from the MPC, the upper level controller, to track the driver's desired yaw rate or prevent the vehicle from becoming unstable. The nonlinearity inevitably encountered in maximizing tire forces is reflected through the extended bicycle model and the combined brushed tire model. The proposed system is verified by the vehicle dynamics software CarSim, and the simulation results show that the MADAS performs better in rear-end collision avoidance situations than conventional advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).

DT Article
ID DRIVING BEHAVIOR
AB Car following is the most common phenomenon in single-lane traffic. The accuracy of acceleration prediction can be effectively improved by the driver's memory in car-following behaviour. In addition, the Apollo autonomous driving platform launched by Baidu Inc. provides fast test vehicle following vehicle models. Therefore, this paper proposes a car-following model (CFDT) with driver time memory based on real-world traffic data. The CFDT model is firstly constructed by embedded gantry control unit storage capacity (GRU assisted) network. Secondly, the NGSIM dataset will be used to obtain the tracking data of small vehicles with similar driving behaviours from the common real road vehicle driving tracks for data preprocessing according to the response time of drivers. Then, the model is calibrated to obtain the driver's driving memory and the optimal parameters of the model and structure. Finally, the Apollo simulation platform with high-speed automatic driving technology is used for 3D visualization interface verification. Comparative experiments on vehicle tracking characteristics show that the CFDT model is effective and robust, which improves the simulation accuracy. Meanwhile, the model is tested and validated using the Apollo simulation platform to ensure accuracy and utility of the model.

AB In precision agriculture, innovative cost-effective technologies and new improved solutions, aimed at making operations and processes more reliable, robust and economically viable, are still needed. In this context, robotics and automation play a crucial role, with particular reference to unmanned vehicles for crop monitoring and site specific operations. However, unstructured and irregular working environments, such as agricultural scenarios, require specific solutions regarding positioning and motion control of autonomous vehicles.
   In this paper, a reliable and cost-effective monocular visual odometry system, properly calibrated for the localisation and navigation of tracked vehicles on agricultural terrains, is presented. The main contribution of this work is the design and implementation of an enhanced image processing algorithm, based on the cross correlation approach. It was specifically developed to use a simplified hardware and a low complexity mechanical system, without compromising performance. By providing sub-pixel results, the presented algorithm allows to exploit low-resolution images, thus obtaining high accuracy in motion estimation with short computing time. The results, in terms of odometry accuracy and processing time, achieved during the in-field experimentation campaign on several terrains proved the effectiveness of the proposed method and its fitness for automatic control solutions in precision agriculture applications.

AB Smart transportation cities are based on intelligent systems and data sharing, whereas human drivers generally have limited capabilities and imperfect traffic observations. The perception of Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) utilizes data sharing through Vehicle-To-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-To-Infrastructure (V2I) communications to improve driving behaviors and reduce traffic delays and fuel consumption. This paper proposes a Double Agent (DA) intelligent traffic signal module based on the Reinforcement Learning (RL) method, where the first agent, the Velocity Agent (VA) aims to minimize the fuel consumption by controlling the speed of platoons and single CAVs crossing a signalized intersection, while the second agent, the Signal Agent (SA) proceeds to efficiently reduce traffic delays through signal sequencing and phasing. Several simulation studies have been conducted for a signalized intersection with different traffic flows and the performance of the single-agent with only VA, DA with both VA and SA, and Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) are compared. It is shown that the proposed DA solution improves the average delay by 47.3% and the fuel efficiency by 13.6% compared to the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM).

(2) What are the emerging future security challenges? (3) What technologies will have the biggest impact on security of public transport in the future? The review identified current personal and operational security challenges associated with: convenience and privacy; interoperability and communication; risks and benefits of increasing connectivity; and skills requirements for the public transport sector. Important emerging security challenges relate to: user and service provider security in a future of data-driven mobility; design and evaluation of security measures for all modes; knowledge-exchange and coordination in research and action to enhance security; and the need to better understand passenger behaviour, needs and attitudes in relation to travel, technology and security. The biggest impact technologies were identified as Vehicle (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; Connected and Autonomous Vehicles and Electric Vehicles) and ICT (Internet of Things; social media; mobile platforms; Open Data, and Big Data). In relation to ICTs, impacts relate to connectivity and data sharing which represent both vulnerabilities and strengths. For vehicle technologies, automation and connectivity were the factors most influencing impact for good or ill.

AB This article presents an evaluation of the system performance of a proposed self-organizing, distributed traffic information system based on vehicle-to-vehicle information-sharing architecture. Using microsimulation, several information applications derived from this system are analyzed relative to the effectiveness and efficiency of the system to estimate traffic conditions along each individual path in the network, to identify possible incidents in the traffic network, and to provide rerouting strategies for vehicles to escape congested spots in the network. A subset of vehicles in the traffic network is equipped with specific intervehicle communication devices capable of autonomous traffic surveillance, peer-to-peer information sharing, and self-data processing. A self-organizing traffic information overlay on the existing vehicular roadway network assists their independent evaluation of route information, detection of traffic incidents, and dynamic rerouting in the network based both on historical information stored in an in-vehicle database and on real-time information disseminated through intervehicle communications. A path-based microsimulation model is developed for these information applications and the proposed distributed traffic information system is tested in a large-scale real-world network. Based on simulation study results, potential benefits both for travelers with such equipment as well as for the traffic system as a whole are demonstrated.

AB As machines and agents become more autonomous, it has been increasingly clear to human factors/ergonomics researchers and practitioners that agent transparency is a critical issue for effective human-agent teaming. Transparency methods can provide the foundation for establishing shared awareness and shared intent between humans and intelligent machines. However, to date, the existing body of research on agent transparency has not been systematically documented. The purpose of this article is to summarize and evaluate current psychological theories and empirical evidence regarding effective agent transparency in human-autonomy teaming. We start by examining how transparency has been operationalized in the literature by discussing the two prominent theoretical frameworks of human-autonomy teaming. We then present a review of the empirical findings concerning how transparency affects key human-autonomy teaming variables, such as operator accuracy, decision time, situation awareness, perceived usability, and workload. This article includes an overview of the experimental tasks, scenarios, and interfaces that have been used in past studies and synthesizes how transparency has been operationalized and manipulated by prior studies. We then summarize the results and conclude by providing key recommendations for future research.

AB As a new disk-shaped autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), the autonomous underwater helicopter (AUH) is devoted to subsea operations, usually diving into the seabed and docking with a subsea docking system. Due to the motion control's performance, the AUH's stability and steady-state accuracy are affected remarkably while docking. Moreover, considering the difficulties of hydrodynamic modeling of AUHs, the classical model-based control method is unsuitable for AUHs. Moreover, there is a large gap between the hydrodynamic simulation results and real situations. Hence, based on the data-driven principle, the linear active disturbance rejection control with a tracking differentiator (LADRC-TD) algorithm is employed for AUH depths and heading control. As the simulation experiments prove, LADRC and LADRC-TD have better anti-interference performance when compared with PID. According to the pool experiments, overshoots of the LADRC-TD are 20 cm and 3 degrees for the depth control and heading control, respectively, which are superior to PID and LADRC. Meanwhile, the steady-state accuracy of the LADRC-TD is +/- 21 cm and +/- 2.5 degrees for the depth and heading control, respectively, which is inferior to PID and the same as LADRC.

AB The use of autonomous vehicles for source localisation is a key enabling tool for disaster response teams to safely and efficiently deal with chemical emergencies. Whilst much work has been performed on source localisation using autonomous systems, most previous works have assumed an open environment or employed simplistic obstacle avoidance, separate from the estimation procedure. In this paper, we explore the coupling of the path planning task for both source term estimation and obstacle avoidance in an adaptive framework. The proposed system intelligently produces potential gas sampling locations that will reliably inform the estimation engine by not sampling in the wake of buildings as frequently. Then a tree search is performed to generate paths toward the estimated source location that traverse around any obstacles and still allow for exploration of potentially superior sampling locations.The proposed informed tree planning algorithm is then tested against the standard Entrotaxis and Entrotaxis-Jump techniques in a series of high fidelity simulations. The proposed system is found to reduce source estimation error far more efficiently than its competitors in a feature rich environment, whilst also exhibiting vastly more consistent and robust results.

AB State-of-the-art automotive radars have an angular resolution of 1 degrees, which is insufficient for estimating the objects shape and boundaries at long distance. In this paper, we design a novel automotive radar with 1m aperture, which is an order of magnitude larger aperture than state-of-the-art automotive radars, and thus achieves super high angular resolution of 0.1 degrees. The radar is designed to overcomes the major technical challenges of a wide aperture radar, which are: non-robust phase coherency over a wide aperture, spanning a wide aperture with sparse antenna elements, simultaneous non-interfering transmissions from a relatively large number of transmit antennas with unambiguous target speed estimation, and high complexity of near-field beamforming. We demonstrate the super high resolution performance of the radar in automotive scenarios, and show that it attains comparable results to a high resolution LIDAR at short range, and outperforms the LIDAR at long ranges. The wide aperture radar has the potential to enable autonomous driving at higher speed, and also to increase the operation of autonomous driving to more regions and climates.

AB Improving and optimizing oceanographic sampling is a crucial task for marine science and maritime resource management. Faced with limited resources in understanding processes in the water column, the combination of statistics and autonomous systems provides new opportunities for experimental design. In this work we develop efficient spatial sampling methods for characterizing regions, defined by simultaneous exceedances above prescribed thresholds of several responses, with an application focus on mapping coastal ocean phenomena based on temperature and salinity measurements. Specifically, we define a design criterion based on uncertainty in the excursions of vector-valued Gaussian random fields and derive tractable expressions for the expected integrated Bernoulli variance reduction in such a framework. We demonstrate how this criterion can be used to prioritize sampling efforts at locations that are ambiguous, making exploration more effective. We use simulations to study and compare properties of the considered approaches, followed by results from field deployments with an autonomous underwater vehicle as part of a study mapping the boundary of a river plume. The results demonstrate the potential of combining statistical methods and robotic platforms to effectively inform and execute data-driven environmental sampling.

AB To resolve the response delay and overshoot problems of intelligent vehicles facing emergency lane-changing due to proportional-integral-differential (PID) parameter variation, an active steering control method based on Convolutional Neural Network and PID (CNNPID) algorithm is constructed. First, a steering control model based on normal distribution probability function, steady constant radius steering, and instantaneous lane-change-based active for straight and curved roads is established. Second, based on the active steering control model, a three-dimensional constraint-based fifth-order polynomial equation lane-change path is designed to address the stability problem with supersaturation and sideslip due to emergency lane changing. In addition, a hierarchical CNNPID Controller is constructed which includes two layers to avoid collisions facing emergency lane changing, namely, the lane change path tracking PID control layer and the CNN control performance optimization layer. The scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation-based forward propagation control law is designed to optimize the PID control performance based on input parameters, and the elastic backpropagation-based module is adopted for weight correction. Finally, comparison studies and simulation/real vehicle test results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness, significance, and advantages of the proposed controller.

AB This article focuses on the speed planning problem for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) communicating to traffic lights. The uncertainty of traffic signal timing for signalized intersections on the road is considered. The eco-driving problem is formulated as a data-driven chance-constrained robust optimization problem. Effective red-light duration (ERD) is defined as a random variable, and describes the feasible passing time through the signalized intersections. Usually, the true probability distribution for ERD is unknown. Consequently, a data-driven approach is adopted to formulate chance constraints based on empirical sample data. This incorporates robustness into the eco-driving control problem with respect to uncertain signal timing. Dynamic programming (DP) is employed to solve the optimization problem. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate optimal speed reference trajectories with 40% less vehicle fuel consumption, while maintaining the arrival time at a similar level compared to a modified intelligent driver model (IDM). The proposed control approach significantly improves the controller's robustness in the face of uncertain signal timing, without requiring to know the distribution of the random variable a priori.

AB With the development of connected automated vehicles (CAVs), traffic flow on the road is generally mixed with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs. In this paper, the full velocity difference (FVD) model and cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) model validated by PATH laboratory of University of California, Berkeley, are used to describe the car-following (CF) driving behavior of HDVs and CAVs, respectively. Firstly, an analytical method for the stability of mixed traffic flow is developed and the stability conditions under different penetration rates of CAVs are obtained. Then, the fundamental diagram model of mixed traffic flow under different penetration rates is derived and the influence factors of the fundamental diagram are analyzed. Finally, a simulation experiment is designed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The simulation results show that there are some differences between the simulation data and the theoretical results under different penetration rates. The simulation data are fluctuating, but they are both on the theoretical curve. The overall trend is consistent with the theoretical results, which proves the validity of the fundamental diagram analysis results. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Obtaining an optimal stability condition is very important to benefit traffic flow operations for a mix of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and regular vehicles. In view of multiple spatial anticipations of CAV car-following models, this paper presents a stability analysis method for mixed CAV flow from the perspective of the uniform local platoon. Transfer function theory was used to derive the stability criterion of the uniform local platoon, based on which a stability chart of equilibrium speeds and CAV feedback coefficients was calculated. Numerical simulations were also performed on a segment of highway with an on-ramp using car-following models to evaluate the impacts of the stability analysis on fuel consumption and emissions [carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), and nitrogen oxides (NOx)]. The stability chart indicates that by controlling CAV feedback coefficients, the optimal stability condition can be obtained, in which the uniform local platoon remains stable for all driving speeds. Moreover, the stability analysis method can reduce fuel consumption and traffic emissions. (C) 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB The purpose of this review article is to present some recent results on the modeling and control of large systems of agents. We focus on particular applications where the agents are capable of independent actions instead of simply reacting to external forces. In the literature, such agents were referred to as autonomous, intelligent, self-propelled, greedy, and others. The main applications we have in mind are social systems (as opinion dynamics), pedestrians' movements (also called crowd dynamics), animal groups, and vehicular traffic. We note that the last three examples include physical constraints; however, the agents are able to inject energy into the system, thus preventing the typical conservation of momentum and energy. In addition, the control problems posed by such systems are new and require innovative methods. We illustrate some ideas developed recently, including the use of sparse controls, limiting the total variation of controls, and defining new control problems for measures. After reviewing various approaches, we discuss some future research directions of potential interest. The latter encompasses both new types of equations and new types of limiting procedures to connect several scales at which a system can be represented. We conclude by illustrating a recent real-life experiment using autonomous vehicles on an open highway to smooth traffic waves. This opens the door to a new era of interventions to control real-time multi-agent systems and to increase the societal impact of such interventions guided by control research.

AB The fast improvement of deep learning methods resulted in breakthroughs in image classification, object detection, and object tracking. Autonomous driving and traffic monitoring systems, especially the on-premise installed fixed position multi-camera configurations, benefit greatly from recent advances. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Camera Multi-Target (MCMT) vehicle tracking system using a constrained hierarchical clustering solution, which improves trajectory matching, and thus provides a more robust tracking of objects transitioning between cameras. YOLOv5, ByteTrack, and ResNet50-IBN ReID networks are used for vehicle detection and tracking. Static attributes such as vehicle type and vehicle color are determined from ReID features with SVM. The proposed ReID feature-based attribute categorization shows better performance, than its pure CNN counterpart. Single-camera trajectories (SCTs) are combined into multi-camera trajectories (MCTs) using hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) with time and space constraints (our proposed algorithm is denoted by MCT#MAC). Similarities between SCTs are measured by comparing the mean ReID features cumulated on the trajectory. The system was evaluated on more datasets, and our experiments demonstrate that constraining HAC by manipulating the proximity matrix greatly improves the multi-camera IDF1 score.

AB This letter studies the trajectory tracking and motion control problems of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). A model predictive control and robust control (MPC-RC) framework for UGVs is proposed to improve tracking accuracy, yaw stability and robustness in a modular fashion without introducing complexity into controller. The trajectory tracking problem and three-dimensional phase trajectory planning with high stability of a vehicle motion can be performed in the model predictive control design simultaneously. Also, combining the advantages of linear matrix inequality, sliding mode control, and back-stepping control law, three robust motion controllers can track the generated three-dimensional phase trajectory steadily so that the UGV motion stability is guaranteed. The robust performance is guaranteed through considering model uncertainties and terra-aerodynamic disturbances in robust controllers. Sufficient conditions for closed-loop stability under the diverse robust factors are provided by the Lyapunov method analytically, which ensures the series system's feasibility. The results of simulations on MATLAB-Carsim platform demonstrate that the proposed controller can significantly enhance tracking accuracy, motion stability, and robustness compared to the existing methods, which guarantees the feasibility and capability of driving in a nonlinear extreme scenario.

AB The development of smart vehicles has increased the demand for high-definition road maps. However, traditional road maps for vehicle navigation systems are not sufficient to meet the requirements of intelligent vehicle systems (e.g., autonomous driving). The present work comes up with a method of generating high-definition map models based on the geographic information system (GIS). A systematic map construction framework including the road layer, intersection connection layer, and lane layer is proposed based on the GIS database. Specifically, the constrained Delaunay triangular network method is applied to extract road layer network models, which are then used as linear reference networks to construct lane-level road maps. To further examine the feasibility of the proposed framework, a field experiment is then conducted to build a high-definition road map. Furthermore, a lane-level map matching test is conducted in the constructed road map using the trajectory data collected from a probe vehicle. The results show that the proposed method provides an efficient way of extracting lane-level information from urban road networks and can be applied for lane-level map matching with good performance.

AB So far, longitudinal motion control has focused on situations like highway driving, where disturbances of the road profile can be neglected. In this paper, we show how the Two Point Tire Model can be used to derive a novel feed-forward control law for a vehicle's longitudinal motion that considers the effects of the road profile and can complement existing control approaches. For this purpose, we recapitulate the basic model assumptions and equations and briefly discuss how it can be used on arbitrary road profiles. Two approaches for implementation in a real vehicle are presented. Comparisons of these approaches in simulation and to a human driver of an experimental vehicle show that the controller can deal with stepped obstacles of up to 14 cm in height. However, the control performance is essentially limited by the actuator delay and human drivers outperform the controller due to their ability of sensing subtle vehicle motions. The results indicate that the control performance can be further improved by using a preview on the necessary drive torque, which can be provided by the solution that we propose.

AB Traditional vehicle localization methods use information from a GPS, inertial navigation, and an odometer, but a GPS is often limited by availability in urban areas for its sensitivity to terrain and interference. Aiming at the above problems, this paper presents a method of intersection localization using a traffic lights' map. In particular, traffic lights with significant visual characteristics in the urban environment are used as landmarks. The localization accuracy of the autonomous vehicle at intersections is improved by combining the location information of traffic lights provided by a high-precision map. The whole scheme of the localization system is designed and the sensors used are determined. First, the coordinates of sensors are established, respectively, and the transformation and rotation are calibrated. Then, the state model and measurement model of the vehicle vision system are established. Combined with the location and height information of the traffic lights provided by the high-precision map, the extended Kalman filter is used to fuse the vision detection results of the traffic lights with the inertial measurement unit information. The experiments demonstrate that the method proposed in this paper improves the lateral localization accuracy and the accuracy of the vehicle's yaw angle.

ID COLLISION-AVOIDANCE; PERCEPTION
AB This paper presents a new approach to semi-autonomous vehicle hazard avoidance and stability control, based on the design and selective enforcement of constraints. This differs from traditional approaches that rely on the planning and tracking of paths and facilitates "minimally-invasive" control for human-machine systems. Instead of forcing a human operator to follow an automation-determined path, the constraint-based approach identifies safe homotopies, and allows the operator to navigate freely within them, introducing control action only as necessary to ensure that the vehicle does not violate safety constraints. This method evaluates candidate homotopies based on "restrictiveness," rather than traditional measures of path goodness, and designs and enforces requisite constraints on the human's control commands to ensure that the vehicle never leaves the controllable subset of a desired homotopy. This paper demonstrates the approach in simulation and characterizes its effect on human teleoperation of unmanned ground vehicles via a 20-user, 600-trial study on an outdoor obstacle course. Aggregated across all drivers and experiments, the constraint-based control system required an average of 43% of the available control authority to reduce collision frequency by 78% relative to traditional teleoperation, increase average speed by 26%, and moderate operator steering commands by 34%.

AB The long term of this ongoing research has to do with increasing degree of autonomy for robots involved in underwater intervention missions. Bearing in mind that the specific mission to face has been the intervention on a panel, in this paper some results in different development stages are presented by using the real mechatronics and the panel mockup. Furthermore, some details are highlighted describing two methodologies implemented for the required visually-guided manipulation algorithms. These algorithms are used to correct problems caused by a bad initialization or miscalibration of the arm. They consist of detecting a marker placed in a known position of the arm and updating the value of each joint after any detection. A roadmap explaining the different testbeds used for experimental validation, in increasing complexity order, is also presented. It is worth mentioning that the aforementioned results would be impossible without previously generated know-how for both the complete developed mechatronics for the autonomous underwater vehicle for intervention, and the required 3D simulation tool. In summary, thanks to the implemented approach, the intervention system is able to control the way in which the gripper approximates and manipulates the two panel devices (i.e. a valve and a connector) in an autonomous manner. Results in different scenarios demonstrate the reliability and feasibility of this autonomous intervention system in water tank and pool conditions.

AB Exploration and mapping of unknown environments is a fundamental task in applications for autonomous robots. In this article, we present a complete framework for deploying Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) in autonomous exploration missions in unknown subterranean areas. The main motive of exploration algorithms is to depict the next best frontier for the MAV such that new ground can be covered in a fast, safe yet efficient manner. The proposed framework uses a novel frontier selection method that also contributes to the safe navigation of autonomous MAVs in obstructed areas such as subterranean caves, mines, and urban areas. The framework presented in this work bifurcates the exploration problem in local and global exploration. The proposed exploration framework is also adaptable according to computational resources available onboard the MAV which means the trade-off between the speed of exploration and the quality of the map can be made. Such capability allows the proposed framework to be deployed in subterranean exploration and mapping as well as in fast search and rescue scenarios. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated in detailed simulation studies with comparisons made against a high-level exploration-planning framework developed for the DARPA Sub-T challenge as it will be presented in this article.

AB The United Nations has long put on the discussion agenda the sustainability challenges of urbanization, which have both direct and indirect effects on future regulation strategies. Undoubtedly, most initiatives target better quality of life, improved access to services & goods and environment protection. As commercial aerial urban transportation may become a feasible research goal in the near future, the connection possibilities between cities and regions scale up. It is expected that the growing number of vertical takeoff & landing vehicles used for passenger and goods transportation will change the infrastructure of the cities, and will have a significant effect on the cityscapes as well. In addition to the widely discussed regulatory and safety issues, the introduction of elevated traffic also raises environmental concerns, which influences the existing and required service and control infrastructure, and thus significantly affects sustainability. This paper provides narrated overview of the most common aspects of safety, licensing and regulations for passenger vertical takeoff & landing vehicles, and highlights the most important aspects of infrastructure planning, design and operation, which should be taken into account to maintain and efficiently operate this new way of transportation, leading to a sustainable urban air mobility ecosystem.

AB Autonomous aerial refueling is a typical close formation flight process, in which the tanker wake has a strong aerodynamic influence to the receiver. In order to develop the accurate aerodynamic models in refueling simulations and design the control laws for autonomous aerial refueling, the tanker wake effects on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) are investigated through ANSYS CFX 15.0. A simplified boom-equipped tanker and a tailless delta wing UAV (named ZD-X) are used in this study. The aerodynamic characteristics of ZD-X in single flight are calculated first and the results are used as the benchmark for comparison. Then the aerodynamic characteristics of ZD-X under the effects of tanker wake are calculated, the final results are given in incremental form to facilitate comparative analysis. Numerical results are obtained from the tanker and receiver at varying lateral, vertical and longitudinal spacings. It is observed that the tanker wake effects on the receiver mostly come from wingtip vortices of the tanker wing and horizontal tail, and the lateral and vertical spacings have significant effects on the aerodynamic characteristics of the receiver, while the longitudinal spacing has almost no effect.

AB Robots that can move autonomously and can make intelligent decisions by perceiving their environments and surrounding objects are known as autonomous mobile robots. Such robots have rapidly moved from laboratories to automated industries to fill a variety of roles in our lives, homes, offices, hospitals, industries, and even on the streets. The interest in mobile robots is growing rapidly, prompting an enormous amount of research over the last 30 years, on critical factors of mobile robots such as locomotion, perception, localization, mapping, ego-motion tracking, and dynamic navigation. This article surveys these essential factors of autonomous mobile robots in terms of mathematical modeling, control issues, and challenging factors. Brief discussions are provided on the fundamentals of these technologies, popular algorithms in comprehensive mode, future challenges, and promising directions to guide the construction of an autonomous mobile robot with high accuracy and effectiveness. Since it is difficult to find complete coverage of those topics in a single location, this article provides a guideline for researchers entering the field or for innovators in the mobile robotics sector. The paper also examines open challenges in indoor mobile robots and identifies potential futures for autonomous mobile robots.

AB Mobility prediction of off-road autonomous ground vehicles (AGV) in uncertain environments is essential for their model-based mission planning, especially in the early design stage. While surrogate modeling methods have been developed to overcome the computational challenge in simulation-based mobility prediction, it is very challenging for a single surrogate model to accurately capture the complicated vehicle dynamics. With a focus on vertical acceleration of an AGV under off-road conditions, this article proposes a surrogate modeling approach for AGV mobility prediction using a dynamic ensemble of nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (NARX) over time. Synthetic vehicle mobility data of an AGV are first collected using a limited number of high-fidelity simulations. The data are then partitioned into different segments using a variational Gaussian mixture model to represent different vehicle dynamic behaviors. Based on the partitioned data, multiple surrogate models are constructed under the NARX framework with different numbers of lags. The NARX models are then assembled together dynamically over time to predict the mobility of the AGV under new conditions. A case study demonstrates the advantages of the proposed method over the classical NARX models for AGV mobility prediction.

AB This paper analyses the transit performance of state-of-the-art underwater vehicles and presents an intermediate-fidelity steady-state flight mechanics model for qualitative performance assessment of underwater vehicles. Focusing on the comparison of underwater gliders and propeller-driven AUVs, a simple glide metric is presented and the transit performance of the legacy underwater gliders Slocum, Spray and Seaglider as well as propeller-modified versions thereof is evaluated. The evaluation is based on various data sets from wind tunnel tests and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) studies, and shows that for the respective hull shapes gliding locomotion proves more efficient in ideal conditions. However, biofouling conditions inflict a double penalty on glider performance, rendering gliders inferior to propeller-driven vehicles. The Slocum data set is used to validate a steady-state flight mechanics model for qualitative performance prediction. It is shown that even simplistic models based on semi-empirical and analytical expressions can be successfully used for design optimization through parametrization. Being computationally efficient, the model can be a useful tool for design engineers in early design phases. The model is used to evaluate the effects of wing span on gliding efficiency, indicating that the current design of the Slocum glider is near-optimal.

AB In this paper, a multi-fusion perceptron architecture and real-time algorithms are proposed for AMR (Autonomous Mobile Robot). Traditionally, AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle) has been used in a large number of indoor logistics warehousing, factory automation, and thus, the corresponding sensor environment must be deployed. AMR needs to have various functions, like autonomous navigation, intelligent control, intelligent visual positioning, intelligent detection, etc., to automatically work in different conditions for traditional required fields. In a factory, there are several modes of operations, multi-machine cooperation, heterogeneous machine cooperation, This paper discusses unmanned machines with sensor elements to collaborate and to establish the complementary spatial information lacking in 3D unmanned carriers. A factory-validated multi-aware fusion of small drones is constructed, and a framework with front-end and back-end design is used for multi-computer communication, information analysis, and decentralized collaborative computing. The whole multi-fusion sensor serial platform is proposed and the system consists of a Logitech C270 USB interface Camera, the V4L2 (Video4Linux) universal driver protocol for communication, and a YDLIDAR G4 laser device serial connection. Through the UART communication interface and microcontroller platform, package information exchange and establish the underlying sensor information acquisition with Ethernet/Wi-Fi for remote sensing, algorithm verification, and real-time image confirmation.

AB Integration technologies of artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous vehicles play important roles in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In order to achieve better logistics distribution efficiency, this paper proposes an intelligent actuator of an indoor logistics system by fusing multiple involved sensors. Firstly, an actuator based on a four-wheel differential chassis is equipped with sensors, including an RGB camera, a lidar and an indoor inertial navigation system, by which autonomous driving can be realized. Secondly, cross-floor positioning can be realized by multi-node simultaneous localization and mappings (SLAM) based on the Cartographer algorithm Thirdly the actuator can communicate with elevators and take the elevator to the designated delivery floor. Finally, a novel indoor route planning strategy is designed based on an A* algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA) and an actual building is tested as a scenario. The experimental results have shown that the actuator can model the indoor mapping and develop the optimal route effectively. At the same time, the actuator displays its superiority in detecting the dynamic obstacles and actively avoiding the collision in the indoor scenario. Through communicating with indoor elevators, the final delivery task can be completed accurately by autonomous driving.

AB In this paper, we introduce a novel and efficient hybrid trajectory planning method for autonomous driving in highly constrained environments. The contributions of this paper are fourfold. First, we present a trajectory planning framework that is able to handle geometry constraints, nonholonomic constraints, and dynamics constraints of cars in a humanlike and layered fashion and generate curvature-continuous, kinodynamically feasible, smooth, and collision-free trajectories in real time. Second, we present a derivative-free global path modification algorithm to extract high-order state information in free space for state sampling. Third, we extend the regular state-space sampling method widely used in on-road autonomous driving systems to a multi-phase deterministic state-space sampling method that is able to approximate complex maneuvers. Fourth, we improve collision checking accuracy and efficiency by using a different car footprint approximation strategy and a two-phase collision checking routine. A range of challenging simulation experiments show that the proposed method returns high-quality trajectories in real time and outperforms existing planners, such as hybrid A* and conjugate-gradient descent path smoother in terms of path quality, efficiency, and computation resources used.

AB As the utilization of complex and heavy applications increases in autonomous driving, research on using mobile edge computing and task offloading for autonomous driving is being actively conducted. Recently, researchers have been studying task offloading algorithms using artificial intelligence, such as reinforcement learning or partial offloading. However, these methods require a lot of training data and critical deadlines and are weakly adaptive to complex and dynamically changing environments. To overcome this weakness, in this paper, we propose a novel task offloading algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization to maintain the system stability and minimize task processing delay. First, a real-time monitoring system is built to utilize distributed computing resources in an autonomous driving environment efficiently. Second, the computational complexity and memory access rate are analyzed to reflect the characteristics of the deep learning applications to the task offloading algorithm. Third, Lyapunov and Lagrange optimization solves the trade-off issues between system stability and user requirements. The experimental results show that the system queue backlog remains stable, and the tasks are completed within an average of 0.4231 s, 0.7095 s, and 0.9017 s for object detection, driver profiling, and image recognition, respectively. Therefore, we ensure that the proposed task offloading algorithm enables the deep learning application to be processed within the deadline and keeps the system stable.

AB In autonomous driving systems, the monocular 3D object detection algorithm is a crucial component. The safety of autonomous vehicles heavily depends on a well-designed detection system. Therefore, developing a robust and efficient 3D object detection algorithm is a major goal for institutes and researchers. Having a 3D sense is essential in autonomous vehicles and robotics, as it allows the system to understand its surroundings and react accordingly. Compared with stereo-based and Lidar-based methods, monocular 3D Object detection is a challenging task as it only utilizes 2D information to generate complex 3D features, making it low-cost, less computationally intensive, and with great potential. However, the performance of monocular methods is impaired due to the lack of depth information. In this paper, we propose a simple, end-to-end, and effective network for monocular 3D object detection without the use of external training data. Our work is inspired by auxiliary learning, in which we use a robust feature extractor as our backbone and multiple regression heads to learn auxiliary knowledge. These auxiliary regression heads will be discarded after training for improved inference efficiency, allowing us to take advantage of auxiliary learning and enabling the model to learn critical information more conceptually. The proposed method achieves 17.28% and 20.10% for the moderate level of the Car category on the KITTI benchmark test set and validation set, respectively, which outperforms the previous monocular 3D object detection approaches.

AB With the growing demands for marine resource exploitation and marine defense security deployment, unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are of great value in both civil and military fields. However, both USVs and AUVs can only operate in a single scenario, which is difficult for complex crossdomain missions. Here, we propose a cross-domain vehicle (CDV) with both high-speed mode as USV and diving mode as AUV. To obtain the capability of high-speed cruising on the water surface, two sets of well-tailored hydrofoils are employed for drag reduction by adjusting the attitudes of CDV. Numerical investigations are carried out to evaluate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the CDV at different velocities. Moreover, prototype tests are conducted in open water, demonstrating its technical feasibility and validating the numerical methods. The results demonstrate a maximum drag reduction of 43% and a significant improvement in longitudinal stability with elaborate design of the hydrofoils. The mechanism of the drag reduction is revealed by flow field analysis, which is a joint effect resulting from the inhibition of wave-making as well as the reduction of the wetted surface area. The current work has significant value for future improvement of CDVs.

AB Vision-based techniques for intelligent vehicles in heterogeneous road environments are gaining significant attention from researchers and industrialists. Unfortunately, the mechanisms in this domain suffer from limited performance due to scene complexity, varying road structure, and improper illumination conditions. These challenging situations may lead an intelligent vehicle into dangerous situations such as collisions or road accidents and may cause higher mortality. The application of intelligent methods and other machine learning techniques for road surface classification is little explored in the existing literature. Thus, we propose a convolutional neural network-based road classification network (RCNet) for the accurate classification of road surfaces. This procedure includes the classification of five major categories of road surfaces: curvy, dry, ice, rough, and wet roads. The experimental results reveal the behavior of the proposed RCNet under various optimizer techniques. The standard performance evaluation measures have been used to test and validate the proposed method on the Oxford RobotCar dataset. RCNet achieves classification accuracy, precision, and sensitivity of 99.90%, and 99.97% of specificity. Results of implemented work are significantly higher than available state-of-the-art techniques and show accurate and effective performance in the complex road environment.

AB Autonomous Underwater Helicopter (AUH) is a disk-shaped Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), and it has comparative advantage of near-bottom hovering and whole-direction turn-around ability over the traditional slender AUV. An optimization design of its irregular geometric profile is essential to improve its hydrodynamic performance. A parametric representation of its profile is proposed in this paper using Non-Uniform Rational B-spline (NURBS) curve. The parametric representation of AUH profile is described with two decision variables and several data points. Based on this parametric curve, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation is carried out to evaluate its hydrodynamic performance with various parameters. A predication model is established over variables' design space using Kriging surrogate model with CFD simulation results and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) procedure is conducted to find optimal design variables, which can produce an optimum lift-drag ratio. CFD verification results confirm that AUH profile with optimized design variables can increase its lift-drag ratio by 2.11 times compared with that of non-optimized ones. It demonstrates that the parametric representation and optimization procedure of AUH profile proposed in this paper is feasible, and it has a great potential in improving AUH's performance.

ID VISION
AB This paper studies the relative pose problem for autonomous vehicles driving in highly dynamic and possibly cluttered environments. This is a challenging scenario due to the existence of multiple, large, and independently moving objects in the environment, which often leads to an excessive portion of outliers and results in erroneous motion estimation. Existing algorithms cannot cope with such situations well. This paper proposes a new algorithm for relative pose estimation using a multi-camera system with multiple non-overlapping cameras. The method works robustly even when the number of outliers is overwhelming. By exploiting specific prior knowledge of the autonomous driving scene, we have developed an efficient 4-point algorithm for multi-camera relative pose estimation, which admits analytic solutions by solving a polynomial rootfinding equation, and runs extremely fast (at about 0.5 mu s per root). When the solver is used in combination with a new random sample consensus sampling scheme by exploiting the conjugate motion constraint, we are able to quickly prune unpromising hypotheses and significantly improve the chance of finding inliers. Experiments on synthetic data have validated the performance of the proposed algorithm. Tests on real data further confirm the method's practical relevance.

AB Considering that few or no human operators are directly involved in the operation of Autonomous Marine Systems (AMS), an online risk model is necessary to enhance the intelligence of the AMS, its situation awareness, and decision-making. The current study identifies the criteria for an online risk model for AMS, which can be used to assess its validity and effectiveness. Taking an under-ice Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) operation as an example, the current work in-vestigates how different risk analysis methods, namely the Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA), the Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA), and Procedural Hazard and Operability Analysis (HAZOP), contribute to fulfilling the different criteria for online risk modeling of AMS. The analysis results show that STPA can be considered a good basis for developing an online risk model due to its relatively good coverage of the identified evaluation criteria, especially its ability to handle the interaction between system and software failure. In addition, considering some shortcomings of using STPA and the changing role of human operators in the AMS operation, PHA and Procedural HAZOP can be used as complementary tools. It is expected that the analysis results and conclusions can be adapted to other AMS as well.

AB With regard to the dynamic obstacles current unmanned aerial vehicles encountered in practical applications, an integral suboptimal trajectory programming method was proposed. It tackled with multiple constraints simultaneously while guiding the unmanned aerial vehicle to execute autonomous avoidance maneuver. The kinetics of both unmanned aerial vehicle and dynamic obstacles were established with appropriate hypotheses. Then it was assumed that the unmanned aerial vehicle was faced with terminal constraints and control constraints in the whole duration. Meanwhile, the performance index was established as minimum control efforts. The initial trajectory was generated according to optimized model predictive static programming. Next, the slack variables were introduced to transform the inequality constraints arising from dynamic obstacle avoidance into equality constraints. In addition, sliding mode control theory was utilized to determine these slack variables' dynamics by designing the approaching law of sliding mode. Then the avoidance trajectory for single or multiple dynamic obstacles was developed by this combined method. At last, a further trajectory optimization was conducted by differential dynamic programming. Consequently, the integral problem was solved step by step and numerical simulations demonstrated that the integral method possessed high computational efficiency.

AB Although unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly indispensable in modern warfare, technology for UAV autonomous decision-making in within-visual-range aerial combat is still a tricky problem because of the complexity of air combat scenarios and rapid situation changes. This paper proposes a novel tactical pursuit point (TPP)-based autonomous decision-making framework to improve UAV decision-making abilities in dogfight scenarios, in which the decision-making problem is decomposed into two procedures: parameterized decision space generation and autonomous decision-making based on the decision space. First, a tactical pursuit space approach is presented to define the parameterized decision space as a convex hull of six tactical pursuit bases with distinct tactical purposes. In this way, a broad set of alternative TPPs can be formed by one decision-making vector. Then, an adaptable approach for both reinforcement learning methods and expert-knowledge-based methods is proposed to easily generate this decision-making vector. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by numerical simulations. It is verified that the TPP-based framework enriches a fighter's decision space while enabling better turning performance and that appropriate maneuvers can be performed on the basis of this framework. The overall win rate is also demonstrated to be dominant. (C) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Aims: Resiniferatoxin (RTX), a vanilloid compound and agonist of the transient receptor potential channel I (TRPV1), is known for its beneficial effects on neurogenic detrusor overactivity. The mainstream rationale for its use is the desensitization of TRPV1 on sensory bladder afferents. However, recent findings showed that TRPV1 is present in other cell types in the bladder. To eliminate the effects of RTX on spinal and central neural circuits, we investigated autonomous contractility in normal and neurogenic rat bladders after treatment with RTX Methods: Female Wistar rats were made paraplegic at vertebral level T8-T9. Animals were intravesically pre-treated with vehicle (ethanol 5%) or RTX (100 nM) and sacrificed after 72 hr. Each bladder was excised and placed in a heated organ bath, where intravesical pressures were measured. Effects on contractile parameters of intravesical volume load, the non-selective muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol (CA) and electrical stimulation (ES) of nerves were studied in both groups. Results: In RTX-treated normal bladders we found shorter contractions with higher amplitude than in control bladders (p < 0.05). In RTX-treated neurogenic bladders the amplitude and duration of autonomous contractions were increased compared with controls (p < 0.05). Furthermore RTX induced an increased response to CA and to ES (p < 0.05). Conclusions: RTX significantly affected the properties of autonomous bladder contractile activity. This provides evidence for local effects of RTX on bladder contractile activity, which are not mediated by afferent neural pathways and which may contribute to the beneficial effects on detrusor overactivity. TRPV1 and TRPV1(+) cells seem to play an important role in (autonomous) bladder contractility.

AB LiDAR is a commonly used sensor for autonomous driving to make accurate, robust, and fast decision-making when driving. The sensor is used in the perception system, especially object detection, to understand the driving environment. Although 2D object detection has succeeded during the deep-learning era, the lack of depth information limits understanding of the driving environment and object location. Three-dimensional sensors, such as LiDAR, give 3D information about the surrounding environment, which is essential for a 3D perception system. Despite the attention of the computer vision community to 3D object detection due to multiple applications in robotics and autonomous driving, there are challenges, such as scale change, sparsity, uneven distribution of LiDAR data, and occlusions. Different representations of LiDAR data and methods to minimize the effect of the sparsity of LiDAR data have been proposed. This survey presents the LiDAR-based 3D object detection and feature-extraction techniques for LiDAR data. The 3D coordinate systems differ in camera and LiDAR-based datasets and methods. Therefore, the commonly used 3D coordinate systems are summarized. Then, state-of-the-art LiDAR-based 3D object-detection methods are reviewed with a selected comparison among methods.

AB Over the last few years, autonomous vehicles have progressed very rapidly. The odometry technique that estimates displacement from consecutive sensor inputs is an essential technique for autonomous driving. In this article, we propose a fast, robust, and accurate odometry technique. The proposed technique is light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-based direct odometry, which uses a spherical range image (SRI) that projects a three-dimensional point cloud onto a two-dimensional spherical image plane. Direct odometry is developed in a vision-based method, and a fast execution speed can be expected. However, applying LiDAR data is difficult because of the sparsity. To solve this problem, we propose an SRI generation method and mathematical analysis, two key point sampling methods using SRI to increase precision and robustness, and a fast optimization method. The proposed technique was tested with the KITTI dataset and real environments. Evaluation results yielded a translation error of 0.69%, a rotation error of 0.0031 degrees/m in the KITTI training dataset, and an execution time of 17 ms. The results demonstrated high precision comparable with state-of-the-art and remarkably higher speed than conventional techniques.

AB Deploying dedicated lanes for automated vehicles (AVs) can effectively alleviate the coordination issues between AVs and manual vehicles (MVs). However, AV platoons running on dedicated AV lanes (DAVLs) have a prom-inent collective behavior characteristic of small inter-vehicle distance. The nearby MV drivers' imitation of this characteristic may reduce their car-following time headway (THW). The researchers conducted a simulation experiment to investigate the influence of DAVL assignments, inter-vehicle distances of AV platoons and AV platoon speed on the car-following performance of nearby MV drivers. The data of mean THW, standard devi-ation of THW, standard deviation of lateral position, standard deviation of velocity, standard deviation of hor-izontal gaze position and mean saccadic peak velocity were collected from 36 participants. Statistical analysis results show that the three factors considerably affected the MV drivers' car-following performance. In partic-ular, the MV drivers showed a worse car-following safety but a better driving stability when the left lane was dedicated to AVs than when the right lane was dedicated to AVs (Note the experiments were done in a drive-on -the-left environment.). With respect to the inter-vehicle distances of AV platoons, the MV drivers' car-following safety was poorer under the 4 m condition than that under the 10 and 18 m conditions. In addition, the MV drivers showed a poorer car-following safety and bore a larger mental workload when driving next to the AV platoons running at 110 km/h. This study may provide some suggestions for DAVLs. Assigning the right lane of a three-lane motorway as the DAVL may have a slighter negative impact on the nearby MV drivers in China. In terms of traffic management in DAVLs, the inter-vehicle distance of AV platoons can be reduced to 10 m, and the speed of AVs should not be higher than the design speed of adjacent MV lanes.

AB The successful landing of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on unmanned vehicle landing platforms is critical for resolving the problem of insufficient range of UAVs in practical missions. Existing localization techniques for autonomous UAV landing are primarily vision-based, but this method is limited due to reliance on external lighting conditions. In this article, we propose a localization system for UAV landing on a mobile platform, which can be conveniently deployed on an unmanned vehicle landing platform. Four ultra wideband (UWB) anchors were deployed on the 0.8 x 1.4 m rectangular unmanned vehicle landing platform. The spacing of the two tags installed on the UAV and the ranging information was used as constraints, and the linear least squares (LLSs) method was used to calculate the iterative initial coordinates of the gradient descent method to solve for the positions of the two UWB tags and fuse them with the inertial measurement unit (IMU) data to provide accurate coordinate for the safe landing of the UAV. By comparing the experiments with the LLSs method in five experiments, it is demonstrated that the average RMSE of the localization system proposed in this article is reduced by 61%.

AB The transition to low- or zero-emission vehicles in the transportation sector is a challenging task toward meeting the greenhouse gas emission targets set by the majority of countries. One way of achieving this goal is to utilise hydrogen gas via fuel cell electric vehicles. This paper investigates the operation, driving range and refuelling process of a fuel cell electric bicycle. The methodology applied includes an estimation of the bike's range under different routes and riders, the riders' opinions and a financial evaluation of the hydrogen fuel cost compared to other urban vehicle alternatives. The results showed a minimum median range-to-energy consumption ratio of 20.5 km/kWh, while the maximum hydrogen cost was found to reach 0.025 (sic)/km when refuelling the hydrogen bicycle in an autonomous hydrogen station. The outcome of this study indicates that the introduction of light-duty hydrogen vehicles in urban transportation may adequately meet the average daily driving distance of city residents.

AB Human-vehicle classification plays an important role in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The use of millimeter wave (mmWave) radar sensor in human-vehicle classification algorithms is of great significance since the sensor maintains to be robust in severe weather (e.g. fog, snow, etc.). To improve classification accuracy under complex scenes of autonomous driving, a new mmWave radar point cloud classification algorithm is proposed in this paper, which realizes human-vehicle classification employing a newly proposed point cloud feature vector with eleven dimensions and based on kernel support vector machine (SVM) classifier. To verify the validity and robustness of the proposed feature vector, a 77 GHz radar is used to collect two datasets for static and moving objects, respectively, with each dataset taken for pedestrians and vehicles at different distances and angles. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves higher classification accuracy than a conventional one based on signal features. For the comparison based on the same number of dimensions, the number of dimensions of the proposed feature vector is decreased by removing the features with low significance. Experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm maintains advantage over the conventional one.

AB This paper presents a state-of-the-art analysis on the methods suitable for vehicle indoor localization and exploiting the RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) technology. The survey describes three main categories of vehicle localization systems: (i) solutions exploiting only the RFID technology, (ii) sensor-fusion techniques combining data from RFID systems and proprioceptive sensors, and (iii) sensor-fusion techniques combing RFID data with those of other exteroceptive sensors in addition to the RFID system itself. For each method, implementation and methodological details are discussed, by highlighting the applied RFID technology, namely passive HF-RFID, passive UHF-RFID, or any other RFID system. Also, the employed RFID parameters, i.e., tag EPC, RSSI or backscattered phase, are discussed. The survey focuses on the achievable localization performance, also accounting for infrastructure-deployment costs together with complexity and maintenance overhead. Positioning, tracking, navigation and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) issues are here considered. The analysis highlights pros and cons of each method, together with the main challenges and perspectives of RFID-based solutions for vehicle localization.

   predictive model; path tracking
AB Path tracking is one of the most important aspects of autonomous vehicles. The current research focuses on designing path-tracking controllers taking into account the stability of the yaw and the nonholonomic constraints of the vehicle. In most cases, the lateral controller design relies on identifying a path reference point, the one with the shortest distance to the vehicle giving the current state of the vehicle. That restricts the controller's ability to handle sudden changes of the trajectory heading angle. The present article proposes a new approach that imitates human behavior while driving. It is based on a discrete prediction model that anticipates the future states of the vehicle, allowing the use of the control algorithm in future predicted states augmented with the current controller output. The performance of the proposed approach is verified through several simulations on V-REP simulator with different types of maneuvers (double lane change, hook road, S road, and curved road) and a wide range of velocities. Predictive Stanley controller was used compared to the original Stanley controller. The obtained results of the proposed control approach show the advantage and the performance of the technique in terms of minimizing the lateral error and ensuring yaw stability by an average of 53% and 22%, respectively.

AB The increasing number of bridges in inland waterways has been continuously posing the potential for ship-bridge collision accidents. To reduce the probability of accidents in the inland bridge area and facilitate the safe passage of the autonomous ship, this paper proposes a path planning method with multiple vector fields, which comprehensively considers the characteristics of inland waters, hydrological characteristics, and meteorological factors. In this method, the navigational environmental factors affecting the path generation are divided into two parts, the static vector field, and the dynamic vector field, in the modeling part of the navigation environment. The static vector field is composed of the obstacle vector field and the channel vector field, and the dynamic vector field is constructed by the simulated wind field and currents field. The resulting synthetic vector field is used as input to the Anisotropic Fast Marching (AFM) algorithm to calculate the optimal path for the autonomous ship under influence of multiple factors. The complete algorithm has been tested and validated through three different scenarios and is evaluated according to four different evaluation criteria. The contribution of this work is to develop a path planning method that could incorporate external environmental influences and navigational risk into the path planning process. The research results of this paper can provide an important reference for the research on the path planning of autonomous ships in the inland bridge area.

AB Autonomy has become a focal point for research and development in many industries. Whilst this was traditionally achieved by modelling self-engineering behaviours at the component-level, efforts are now being focused on the sub-system and system-level through advancements in artificial intelligence. Exploiting its benefits requires some innovative thinking to integrate overarching concepts from big data analysis, digitisation, sensing, optimisation, information technology, and systems engineering. With recent developments in Industry 4.0, machine learning and digital twin, there has been a growing interest in adapting these concepts to achieve autonomous maintenance; the automation of predictive maintenance scheduling directly from operational data and for in-built repair at the systems-level. However, there is still ambiguity whether state-of-the-art developments are truly autonomous or they simply automate a process.
   In light of this, it is important to present the current perspectives about where the technology stands today and indicate possible routes for the future. As a result, this effort focuses on recent trends in autonomous maintenance before moving on to discuss digital twin as a vehicle for decision making from the viewpoint of requirements, whilst the role of AI in assisting with this process is also explored. A suggested framework for integrating digital twin strategies within maintenance models is also discussed. Finally, the article looks towards future directions on the likely evolution and implications for its development as a sustainable technology.

AB We propose Occupancy Flow Fields, a new representation for motion forecasting of multiple agents, an important task in autonomous driving.Our representation is a spatio-temporal grid with each grid cell containing both the probability of the cell being occupied by any agent, and a two-dimensional flow vector representing the direction and magnitude of the motion in that cell. Our method successfully mitigates shortcomings of the two most commonly-used representations for motion forecasting: trajectory sets and occupancy grids. Although occupancy grids efficiently represent the probabilistic location of many agents jointly, they do not capture agent motion and lose the agent identities. To this end, we propose a deep learning architecture that generates Occupancy Flow Fields with the help of a new flow trace loss that establishes consistency between the occupancy and flow predictions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using three metrics on occupancy prediction, motion estimation, and agent ID recovery. In addition, we introduce the problem of predicting speculative agents, which are currently-occluded agents that may appear in the future through dis-occlusion or by entering the field of view. We report experimental results on a large in-house autonomous driving dataset and the public INTERACTION dataset, and show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models.

AB In this study, we selected four real-world rear-end crash scenarios with different crash characteristics. The vehicles involved in those crashes were not equipped with any crash avoidance systems. We then used the accident reconstruction method to build those crash scenarios in PC-Crash software. Then, different FCW/AEB safety algorithms have been defined for a subject vehicle model in each crash scenario and each scenario was simulated for a set of input parameters such as vehicle speed, brake intensity, and driver reaction time. The range and distribution of input parameters were extracted from the related field crash data and available literature. A total number of 16000 simulations have been conducted which produced input-output datasets for further investigations. Finally, the effects of input parameters on simulation outcomes including crash occurrence, AEB activation, injury risk, and vehicle damage have been quantified using the Boruta algorithm. The results indicated that the overall effectiveness of the AEB system was a 57% reduction of rear-end crashes, a 52% reduction of injury severity (striking vehicle's passengers), and a 47% reduction of damages for striking vehicles. The results also showed that the available AEB algorithms were more effective for the average speed equal to or less than 80 kmph. The speed of the subject vehicle, type of AEB algorithm, sensor detection range, and driver reaction time were the most important parameters on crash outcomes. In addition, the results indicated that the performance of FCW had a direct impact on the effectiveness of the AEB system for the integrated FCW + AEB system.

AB Finding a sustainable mobility solution for the future is one of the most competitive challenges in the logistics and transportation sector nowadays. Researchers, universities, and companies are working intensively to provide novel mobility options that can be environmentally friendly and sustainable. While autonomous car-sharing services have been introduced as a very promising solution, an innovative alternative is arising using self-driving bikes. Shared autonomous cargo bike fleets are likely to increase the livability and sustainability of the city as the use of cargo bikes in an on-demand mobility service can replace the use of cars for short-distance trips and enhance connectivity to public transportation. However, more research is still needed to develop this new concept. To address this research gap, this paper examines the on-demand shared-use autonomous bikes service (OSABS) from a fleet management perspective. In fact, such a system requires good management strategies in order to ensure its efficiency. Through an agent-based simulation of a case study in Magdeburg, we investigate various parameters that can influence the performance and the service quality of OSABS such as the rebalancing frequency and the relocation type. Tests were performed for two different operational areas: the inner city and the complete city of Magdeburg. We conclude with different management insights for an optimized functioning of the system.

ID MOVING-OBJECT DETECTION; URBAN ENVIRONMENTS; STEREO
AB As a core step of obstacle avoidance and path planning, dynamic obstacle detection is critical for autonomous driving. This study aimed to propose a dynamic obstacle detection method based on U-V disparity and residual optical flow for autonomous driving. First, a drivable area of an unmanned vehicle was detected using U-V disparity images. Then, obstacles in the drivable area were detected using U-V disparity images and the geometric relationship between obstacle size and its disparity. Finally, the motion likelihood of each obstacle was estimated by compensating the camera ego-motion. The innovation of the proposed method was that the searching range of the moving obstacles was greatly narrowed by detecting the obstacles in the drivable area, which greatly improved not only the moving obstacle detection efficiency but also the detection accuracy. Datasets from the KITTI benchmark and our self-acquired campus scene data were chosen as testing samples. The experimental results showed that our method could achieve high detection precision, low missed detection rate and less time consumption.

DE Aerial Systems: Perception and autonomy; RGB-D perception; vision-based
   navigation
AB Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) have become increasingly popular due to their wide applications in many areas. For autonomous navigation and safe control of MAVs, it is essential to have accurate and reliable velocity and position estimation. However, due to limited computational power and payload, it is still challenging for autonomous operation of MAVs in complex environments. In this paper, we propose a robust and efficient velocity estimation framework for MAVs with a single downward-facing RGB-D camera, which is able to provide metric velocity estimation in three dimensions as well as yaw rate in real-time without the fusion of additional sensors. Unlike traditional algorithms, our method uses kernel cross-correlators (KCCs) to efficiently determine optical flow for motion estimation, which does not rely on costly feature extraction and matching process. Moreover, we utilize depth images to estimate the vertical velocity of MAVs without the assumption of a flat ground. Autonomous flight tests on a quadrotor in complex environments demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our method.

AB The autonomous operations of marine vehicles have recently attracted significant attention. In particular, automation of harbor operations, such as autonomous docking or berthing, is a challenging target. In low-speed harbor operations, the external disturbance of wind is a non-negligible factor. Therefore, the stochastic behavior of gusty wind should be considered in numerical simulations. This study presents a practical computational scheme for generating random wind velocity fields. In the proposed method, the von Karman's spectrum [1] and Hino's wind speed spectrum [2] were fitted by a degree of freedom (1DoF) filter driven by the Wiener process. The corresponding Ito's equation had the form of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. By employing the analytical solution of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, the wind process was successfully generated without time series repetition. Furthermore, the wind speed and direction processes were also generated from the measured drift and diffusion terms. The spectra of these numerical results are consistent with the observed spectra.

AB This letter proposes a reactive, safe, and high-performance distributed constrained control law for ensuring safety in multi-UAV systems. The UAVs possess higher-order nonlinear dynamics and are subject to actuation and collision avoidance constraints. To address the case of real-time multi-UAV collision avoidance, we propose a novel Trajectory-Tube Distributed Explicit Reference Governor (TT-D-ERG) approach based on the idea of embedding future state trajectories into safety tubes. The control law is ideally suited for systems with limited on-board hardware for computation and communication. The safety, efficacy, performance, and scalability of the method are demonstrated and benchmarked against state-of-the-art real-time collision avoidance methods by simulations and field experiments with multiple quadrotor UAVs (videos at https://youtu.be/V4P1O8vhKlo).

AB Forest fires continue to be one of the major environmental problems facing society today. In addition to the high environmental impact, the destruction of ecosystems and possible human losses, the economic costs of fire-fighting must be added. All these reasons have led to the search, in current technology, for tools and systems to help in fire-fighting tasks and, more specifically, the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The fact that UAVs can reach remote locations quickly and embark on sensors and devices to assist in dangerous and risky tasks makes them ideal for firefighting. This work includes the development, in collaboration with Telefonica Digital Espana, of an effective tool using current technology present in robotics, in which a drone is capable of carrying out fire surveillance and monitoring tasks autonomously, thanks to the sensors and devices on board. In addition, a graphical interface is implemented that allows the exchange of information between the aircraft and the ground user.

AB In order to improve profitability, freight forwarding companies try to organize their operational transportation planning systematically, considering not only their own fleet but also external resources. Such external resources include vehicles from closely related subcontractors in vertical cooperations, autonomous common carriers on the transportation market, and cooperating partners in horizontal coalitions. In this paper, the transportation planning process of forwarders is studied and the benefit of including external resources is analyzed. By introducing subcontracting, the conventional routing of own vehicles is extended to an integrated operational transportation planning, which simultaneously constructs fulfillment plans with overall lowest costs using the own fleet and subcontractors' vehicles. This is then combined with planning strategies, which intend to increase the profitability by exchanging requests among members in horizontal coalitions. Computational results show considerable cost reductions using the proposed planning approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB One of the major challenges in designing an autonomous agent system is to achieve the objective of recreating human-like cognition by exploiting the growing pragmatic architectures that act intelligently and intuitively in vital fields. Consequently, this research addresses the general problem of designing an agent-based autonomous flight control (AFC) architecture of a UAV to facilitate autonomous routing/navigation in uncharted and unascertained environments of organized foyer surroundings. The specific problem of this research is the indoor environment because of the perplexing characteristics of the required flight mechanics. We design the AFC agent architecture to consist of data acquisition, perception, localization, mapping, control, and planning modules. The AFC agent performs search and survey missions that entail commanding the UAV while performing object classifications and recognition tasks. The agent implements several image handling algorithms to detect and identify objects from their colors and shapes. It captures the video images acquired from a solitary onboard, front-facing camera which are handled off-board on a computer. We conduct tests on the AFC agent, and the results show that the agent successfully controls the UAV in three performed test cases and a total of nine implemented missions. The AFC agent detects and identifies all the assigned objects with a recall score of 1.00, a precision score of 0.9563, an accuracy score of 0.9573, an F1 score of 0.9776, an efficiency score of 0.5239, a detection total time score of 225.5 s, and an identification total time of 275 s and outperforms a human operator.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present the synthesis of a robust controller for autonomous small-scale helicopter hovering control using extended H-infinity loop shaping design techniques.
   Design/methodology/approach - This work presents the development of a robust controller for smooth hovering operation required for many autonomous helicopter operations using H-infinity loop shaping technique incorporating the Vinnicombe-gap (v-gap) metric for validation of robustness to uncertainties due to parameter variation in the system model. Simulation study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the designed controller for robust stability to uncertainty, disturbance rejection, and time-domain response in line with ADS-33E level 1 requirements.
   Findings - The proposed techniques for a robust controller exhibit an effective performance for both nominal plant and 20 percent variation in the nominal parameters in terms of robustness to uncertainty, disturbance wind gust attenuation up to 95 percent, and transient performance in compliance with ADS-33E level 1 specifications.
   Research limitations/implications - The controller is limited to hovering and low-speed flight envelope.
   Practical implications - This is expected to provide efficient hovering/low-speed autonomous helicopter flight control required in many civilian unmanned aerial vehicles applications. Also, the technique can be used to simplify the number of robust gain-scheduled linear controllers required for wide-envelope flight.
   Social implications - The research will facilitate the deployment of low cost, small-scale autonomous helicopters in various civilian applications.
   Originality/value - The research addresses the challenges of parametric variation inherent in helicopter hovering/low-speed control using an extended H-infinity loop shaping technique with v-gap metric.

AB Optimal deployment and accurate localization of sensor nodes have a strong influence on the performance of a wireless sensor network (WSN). This paper considers real-time autonomous deployment of sensor nodes from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Such a deployment has importance, particularly in ad hoc WSNs, for emergency applications, such as disaster monitoring and battlefield surveillance. The objective is to deploy the nodes only in the terrains of interest, which are identified by segmentation of the images captured by a camera on board the UAV. Bioinspired algorithms, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and bacterial foraging algorithm (BFA), are presented in this paper for image segmentation. In addition, PSO and BFA are presented for distributed localization of the deployed nodes. Image segmentation for autonomous deployment and distributed localization are formulated as multidimensional optimization problems, and PSO and BFA are used as optimization tools. Comparisons of the results of PSO and BFA for autonomous deployment and distributed localization are presented. Simulation results show that both the algorithms perform multilevel image segmentation faster than the exhaustive search for optimal thresholds. Besides, PSO-based localization is observed to be faster, and BFA-based localization is more accurate.

AB Collision avoidance and platooning applications require vehicle localization at cm-level accuracy and at least 50 Hz rate for full autonomy. The RADAR/LIDAR and camera based methods currently used for vehicle localization do not satisfy these requirements, necessitating complementary technologies. Visible light positioning (VLP) is a highly suitable complementary technology due to its high accuracy and high rate, exploiting the line-of-sight propagation feature of the visible light communication (VLC) signals from LED head/tail lights. However, existing vehicular VLP algorithms impose restrictive requirements, e.g., use of high-bandwidth circuits, road-side lights and certain VLC modulation strategies, and work for limited relative vehicle orientations, thus, are not feasible for general use. This paper proposes a VLC-based vehicle localization method that eliminates these restrictive requirements by a novel VLC receiver design and associated vehicular VLP algorithm. The VLC receiver, named QRX, is low-cost/size, and enables high-rate VLC and high-accuracy angle-of-arrival (AoA) measurement, simultaneously, via the usage of a quadrant photodiode. The VLP algorithm estimates the positions of two head/tail light VLC transmitters (TX) on a neighbouring vehicle by using AoA measurements from two QRXs for localization. The algorithm is theoretically analyzed by deriving its Cramer-Rao lower bound on positioning accuracy, and simulated localization performance is evaluated under realistic platooning and collision avoidance scenarios. Results demonstrate that the proposed method performs at cm-level accuracy and up to 250 Hz rate within a 10 m range under realistic harsh road and channel conditions, demonstrating its eligibility for collision avoidance and safe platooning.

AB To achieve high-frequency and effective inter-vehicle communication between harvesters and transport vehicles during cooperative harvesting, a protocol for wireless communication was designed by analyzing actual communication requirements. Two different wireless communication modes (radio and 4G) were selected for the hardware design; then, a Kalman Filter was designed based on real-time Dead-reckoning and inter-vehicle Communication data after delay Compensation (KFDCC). Finally, the relative longitudinal deviation between two vehicles was obtained and updated steadily at a 10 Hz frequency. By using the relative longitudinal deviation of two vehicles, calculated after aligning the UTC stamp with the local GNSS data from the harvester and transport vehicle as a comparative metric, accuracy evaluation experiments were conducted regarding radio and 4G. The maximum absolute errors of the KFDCC output value were 0.03783 and 0.07381 m, respectively, and the mean square errors were 0.00392 and 0.01317 m, respectively. Compared with systems without the KFDCC method, the mean square errors were reduced by 88.76% and 90.60%, respectively. The KFDCC method can also effectively solve the problems of data delay, packet loss, blockage, error, and so on, in wireless communication, and has short-time breakpoint endurance capabilities. Field experiments showed that the proposed method can provide accurate data support for the dynamic alignment and unloading processes of harvesters and transport vehicles, and it can also provide algorithmic support for real-time communication data fusion between different wireless communication modes. Overall, the inter-vehicle communication mode and data-processing method designed in this paper have good effects and adaptability, and they can guarantee that the whole process of autonomous harvesting operates properly.

AB In this paper, we first investigate the problem of finding an algorithm for the movement of a car-like vehicle to track a given directed straight line. Car-like vehicles' motions possess 2 d.o.f., speed upsilon and path curvature kappa. We compute the 'derivative of path curvature', lambda = d kappa/ds, rather than the path curvature kappa itself, to enforce continuous-curvature vehicle motions. Specifically, we compute lambda as a linear function of the current path curvature, orientation and positional difference of the vehicle against the given line. We call this function lambda the steering function. The uniform asymptotic stability of the feedback rule is proved through linearization and a Lyapunov function. Next, this basic line-tracking result is applied to the problem of path tracking where a path consists of directed straight lines. The main advantages and features of the results are summarized as follows. ii! Since the derivative d kappa/ds of path curvature is obtained, the path curvature is always continuous while a vehicle converges to the line. (ii) By assuming the critical damping condition, the steering function contains one parameter a that controls the smoothness (or equivalently, sharpness) of vehicle motions. (iii) This theory can be applied to a vehicle with any wheel architecture, i.e. this theory is vehicle independent. (iv) The theory can easily be extended to the more general problem of tracking a path consisting of any number of directed lines with a new principle of neutral switching. (v) The simplicity and machine independence of this theory makes implementation of this theory on vehicles easy. We present numerous simulation results of line/path-tracking motions. These results verify the effectiveness of this continuous-curvature motion control method. Some successful results obtained on the autonomous robot Yamabico at the Naval Postgraduate School are also included.

TI Limitations of employing undirected information flow graphs for the
   maintenance of rigid formations for heterogeneous vehicles
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Autonomous vehicles; Approximately rigid formations; String instability
ID STABILITY; MOTION
AB In this paper, we consider the problem of decentralized control of a collection of heterogeneous vehicles trying to maintain a rigid formation. In a rigid formation of vehicles, the separation distance between any pair of vehicles does not change throughout their motion and equals a pre-specified value that defines the formation. In each formation, there is a set of reference vehicles and a set of following vehicles. A reference vehicle may not be influenced by the motion of the following vehicle, but the motion of the following vehicle is influenced by the motion of the reference vehicle. Since we will be primarily dealing with translational maneuvers of the formation, we will consider formations where there is only one reference vehicle whose motion specifies the desired motion for all the vehicles in the formation. Each following vehicle attempts to maintain a specified constant safe distance from its adjacent vehicles in the collection. We call a vehicle B adjacent to a vehicle A if the relative position of vehicle B is known to vehicle A either by communication or by sensing. We only consider information flow graphs that are undirected when restricted to the set of following vehicles, i.e., graphs where a following vehicle A is adjacent to a following vehicle B if and only if the following vehicle B is adjacent to the following vehicle A. We model each vehicle as a point mass of one unit with two types of forces act on each vehicle - a controlled force, which is the output of an actuation system and a disturbing force over which there is no control. The actuation system is assumed to be linear and time invariant, and may be representable by a rational and strictly proper transfer function. The input to the control system of a vehicle in the formation is based on the error in maintaining the desired separation from its adjacent vehicles and the output of the control system is a command to the actuator.
   An earlier result showed that spacing errors due to disturbances amplify in a collection of identical vehicles with identically structured linear controllers if the reference vehicle information is not available to Omega(n) (A function f(n) is Omega(g(n)) if there is a constant c > 0 and a N > 0 such that vertical bar f(n)vertical bar> c vertical bar g(n)vertical bar for all n > N.) vehicles, n being the size of the collection [1]. From the viewpoint of tolerance to communication failures, it is therefore necessary that there be at least two vehicles in the formation that are adjacent to Omega(n) vehicles in the formation. In this paper, we consider a broad class of heterogeneously structured controllers defined by a pre-specified bound, say B(c) > 0 as follows: the allowable controller in conjunction with the actuation systems on-board any vehicle will produce a force no greater than Bc in response to a constant input to the control system. If this class of controllers were to be employed with the aforesaid undirected information flow graphs, we show that there is a critical size of the formation beyond which the motion of the vehicles in the formation will be unstable. This result shows the inability to scale such controllers for maintenance of rigid formations in conjunction with undirected information flow graphs. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Over the last years, there have been initiated several pilots with autonomous minibusses. Unlike regular bus services, autonomous minibusses serve a limited number of stops and have more flexible schedules since they do not require bus drivers. This allows the operation of a line through a flexible combination of sublines, where a subline serves a subset of consecutive stops in the same order as the original line. This paper studies the subline frequency setting (SFS) problem under uncertain passenger demand. We present a frequency setting model that assigns autonomous minibusses to sublines in order to exploit the available resources as much as possible and minimize the operational and passenger waiting time costs. Passenger waiting time costs may depend on the combination of several lines whose frequencies cannot be perfectly aligned for each passenger journey. We present a new estimation of the expected waiting time for passengers to improve the accuracy of the passenger waiting time costs in the case of sublines. Our SFS model is originally formulated as a MINLP and reformulated as a MILP that can be solved to global optimality. Further, we explicitly consider the uncertainty of passenger demand in the optimization process by formulating a stochastic optimization model. The performances of our stochastic and deterministic models that assign minibusses to sublines are tested under various passenger demand scenarios in the 14-stop autonomous minibus line in Eberbach, Germany and a fictional bus line with 20 bus stops. Results show potential improvements in operational costs in the range of 10%-40% depending on the passenger demand profile.

ID TARGET TRACKING
AB In this work, we study the order statistic estimation and provide a simple solution to lidar bounding box (BB) centroid estimation for an autonomous vehicle. The estimated BB centroid and its uncertainty will be used in object tracking as measurement and measurement noise variance; the latter is commonly not available from the sensor manufacturer, and is needed for data association and target state estimation. The detected and clustered sensor observations for a single target, on one axis, are assumed to have 1) a triangular density or 2) a uniform (rectangular) density. These densities constitute the likelihood function (LF) of the corresponding support (the interval where they are nonzero) boundaries. Estimators are proposed for the LF support boundary parameter estimation and the centroid coordinates are given by the centers of the boundaries. Experiments using real data are carried out to show the performance of the proposed methods for autonomous driving applications. A comparison with the max-min average approach shows the superiority of the proposed algorithm.

ID MULTILANE DETECTION; PUBLIC TRANSPORT; LOCALIZATION
AB In this paper, we present a driverless taxi system for autonomous campus mobility services. College campuses have unique mobility requirements in terms of layout, population, and demand and patterns. It is typically recommended to minimize the presence of private automobiles on campuses due to teaching and research disturbances, visual degradation from parking provision, environmental pollution, and negative health effects. As an alternative to private automobiles, shared mobility systems have been considered for both campus and urban transportation. Conventional shuttle systems suffer from the first and last mile problem. A bicycle and pedestrian friendly policy is not a generalizable solution for all geographic locations and campus layouts. We suggest a driverless taxi service as an alternative point-to-point shared mobility system for campuses. We have demonstrated the feasibility of this service on a 4.5-km campus road at Seoul National University. The service has covered over 10 000 km autonomously since the first public demonstration was made in November 2015.

AB Much effort has been invested during the past decades in design of parafoils for a wide range of payloads and in development of means for their guidance. Existing parafoils are capable of autonomous navigation using the global positioning system and other onboard sensors. The purpose of this study is to explore the advantages of coordination among multiple autonomous parafoils. Each parafoil is able to navigate to the target on its own by following a real-time-generated reference trajectory. A new method for trajectory generation is presented and behaviour-based rules are developed that control the relative motion of the descending parafoils. The set of simple rules results in an emergent behaviour known as flocking. The coupling between trajectory following and flocking is studied in a multiagent simulation. The simulation uses a realistic six-degrees-of-freedom model of a heavy cargo parafoil. The obtained results demonstrate the possibility of flocking behaviour for guided parafoils. The flocking rules ensure safe separation between the vehicles headed for the same target and allow the parafoils to follow a reference trajectory as a group.

AB This paper develops a navigation system based on complementary filtering for position and attitude estimation, with application to autonomous surface crafts. Using strapdown inertial measurements, vector observations, and global positioning system (GPS) aiding, the proposed complementary filters provide attitude estimates in Euler angles representation and position estimates in Earth frame coordinates, while compensating for rate gyro bias. Stability and performance properties of the proposed filters under operating conditions usually found in oceanic applications are derived, and the tuning of the filter parameters in the frequency domain is emphasized. The small computational requirements of the proposed navigation system make it suitable for implementation on low-power hardware and using low-cost sensors, providing a simple yet effective multirate architecture suitable to be used in applications with autonomous vehicles. Experimental results obtained in real time with an implementation of the proposed algorithm running on-board the DELFIMx catamaran, an autonomous surface craft developed at ISR/IST for automatic marine data acquisition, are presented and discussed.

AB In this paper, we propose three cooperative operational modes of manned and unmanned submersibles for a range of different deep-sea application scenarios. For large-scale exploration, a lander or an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is paired with one or more autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), while the liberated research vessel R/V can transport the manned submersible to another area for diving operations. When manned submersibles and AUVs perform small-scale accurate measurements, the research vessel R/V supports both submersible types for diving operations and has a positioning and communication time allocation mechanism for cooperative operations. Through the analysis of the operating efficiency of different modes, we found that the cooperative operational mode based on the pure research vessel R/V is suitable for local small-scale accurate detection, and the cooperative operational mode based on the USV/lander system is suitable for large-scale and long-distance underwater operations.

AB This paper deals with collision risk modeling and assessment for autonomous air vehicles. The suggested approach simplifies the problem by resolving the workspace into horizontal and vertical planes. Collision in 3-D corresponds to simultaneous collisions in the horizontal and vertical planes. Collision conditions are first derived for the deterministic case and then discussed in the presence of uncertainties. The collision conditions are expressed as inequalities in terms of the time rates of the bearing and the collision cone angles. This formulation brings important simplifications since it does not explicitly use speed and orientation information. Monte Carlo simulation is used to calculate the probability of collision in the presence of uncertainties. An important advantage of Monte Carlo methods is their ability to deal with uncertainty propagation in nonlinear systems with non-Gaussian noise. The simplicity of the collision inequalities allows for fast implementation of the Monte Carlo algorithm. Results are illustrated using simulation.

AB This paper analyzes the characteristics of mixed traffic flow with maximum platoon size of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) based on analytical and simulation methods. First, we discuss the car-following and headway types of mixed traffic flows with human-driven vehicles (HDVs), connected human-driven vehicles (CHVs), automated vehicles (AVs), and CAVs. Second, the probability distribution of the CAVs platoon size is derived based on the Markov chain model. Subsequently, the capacity model and stability condition of mixed traffic flow are proposed based on the probability distribution of the CAVs platoon size, and some characteristics of the influence of the maximum platoon size on traffic capacity and stability are analyzed. A numerical experi-ment based on car-following models was conducted to investigate the effect of the maximum platoon size on capacity, stability, safety, fuel consumption, and emission of mixed traffic flow. The results show that (1) the capacity of mixed traffic flow increases with the maximum platoon size of CAVs; (2) the stability of mixed traffic flow deteriorates with the increase in the maximum platoon size of CAVs; (3) the safety risk of vehicles in mixed traffic flow increases with the maximum platoon size of CAVs; (4) the fuel consumption and emissions (e.g., CO, HC, and NOx) increase with the maximum platoon size of CAVs. This indicates that the larger maximum platoon size can only improve traffic capacity, which is not conducive to the stability, safety, fuel con-sumption, and emissions of mixed traffic flow.

AB Autonomous vehicle detection and tracking are crucial for intelligent transportation management and control systems. Although many techniques are used to develop smart traffic systems, this article discusses vehicle detection and tracking using pixel-labeling and real-time tracking. We propose a novel smart traffic control system that segments the image using an Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) classifier to extract the foreground objects. The proposed model is divided into the following steps: 1) at first, all the images are preprocessed to remove noise; 2) pixel-labeling is performed by using the XGBoost classifier to separate the background from the foreground; 3) all the pixels classified as a vehicle was extracted and converted into a binary image, then blob extraction technique is used to localize each vehicle; 4) to verify the detected vehicles Intersection over Union (IoU) score using the ground truth is calculated; 5) all verified vehicles were subjected to Visual Geometry Group (VGG) feature extraction and based on which a unique identifier was assigned to each of them to enable multi-object tracking across the image frames; 6) vehicles are counted and categorized into stationary and moving cars by detecting motion in each of them using Farneback optical flow algorithm; and 7) finally, the Simple Online and Real-time Tracker (SORT) is used for tracking. The proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art traffic monitoring techniques in terms of precision, achieving 0.86 for detection and 0.92 for tracking with the Karlsruher Institut for Technology Aerial Image Sequences (KIT-AIS) dataset, 0.83 for detection, and 0.87 for tracking with the Vision Meets Drone Single Object-Tracking (VisDrone) dataset. The proposed system can be used for several purposes, such as vehicle identification in traffic, traffic density detection at intersections, traffic flow conditions on the road, and providing a pedestrian way.

AB We study the application of Linked Autonomous Interplanetary Satellite Orbit Navigation (LiAISON) to track vehicles on the far side of the lunar surface. The LiAISON architecture is demonstrated to achieve accurate orbit determination solutions for various mission scenarios in the Earth-Moon system. Given the proper description of the force field, LiAISON is capable of producing absolute orbit determination solutions using relative satellite-to-satellite tracking observations alone. The lack of direct communication between Earth-based tracking stations and the far side of the Moon provides an ideal opportunity for implementing LiAISON. This paper presents a novel approach to use the LiAISON architecture to perform autonomous navigation of assets on the lunar far side surface. Relative measurements between a spacecraft placed in an EML-2 halo orbit and lunar surface asset(s) are simulated and processed. Comprehensive simulation results show that absolute states of the surface assets are observable with an achieved accuracy of the position estimate on the order of tens of meters. (C) 2015 IAA.

AB An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is a self-propelled, untethered underwater vehicle with minimal or no human supervision. However, the capability of a single AUV to cover large areas underwater is very limited. In this regard, a swarm of AUVs has gained significant attention in the recent years for underwater applications such as ocean exploration, mine-sweeping, surveillance, rescue missions, seabed mapping, environmental monitoring, etc. Notably, the swarm-based network can be further classified into two types, based on the architecture: cooperative multi-AUV network and leader-follower multi-AUV network. Of these, the leader-follower multi-AUV network with a Fixed Leader is preferable due to its simple architecture and less operational complexity. However, the inherent energy limitations of the leader in the leader-follower model become the bottleneck for an efficient mechanism. Hence, there is a need to design a better mechanism for a multi-AUV network. In this paper, a Generalized Energy-based Leader Selection (GELS) algorithm is proposed for a multi-AUV network to increase the AUV network's transmission range and duration. Significantly, GELS can be superimposed and integrated with the existing algorithms. This proposed work integrates GELS with two bio-inspired mechanisms: Ant Colony Optimization and Particle Swarm Optimization. The dynamic leader selection using GELS results more in the travel distance and duration than the Fixed Leader network. This is because, in GELS, based on residual energy, the followers could also be allowed to lead the network; whereas, in fixed leader, the followers cannot lead the network.

AB In this paper, a new framework for path tracking is proposed through learning to drive like human beings. Firstly, the imitation algorithm (behavior cloning) is adopted to initialize the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm through learning the professional drivers' experience. Secondly, a continuous, deterministic, model free deep reinforcement learning algorithm is adopted to optimize our DRL model on line through trial and error. By combining behavior cloning and deep reinforcement learning algorithms, the DRL model can learn an effective policy quickly for path tracking using some easy-to-measure vehicle state parameters and environment information as inputs. Actor-Critic structure is adopted in the DRL algorithm. In order to speed up the convergence rate of the DRL model and improve the learning effect, we propose a dual actor networks structure for the two different action outputs (steering wheel angle and vehicle speed), and a chief critic network is built to guide the updating process of dual actor networks at the same time. Based on this dual actor networks structure, we can pick out some more important state information as state inputs for different action outputs. Besides, a kind of reward mechanism is also presented for autonomous driving. Finally, simulation training and experiment test are carried out, and the results confirm that the framework proposed in this paper is more than data efficient than the original algorithm, and the trained DRL model can track the reference path with accuracy and has the generalization ability for different roads.

AB With autonomous vehicles (AVs) still in the testing phase, researchers and planners must resort to simulation techniques to explore possible futures regarding shared and automated mobility. An agent based discrete-event transport simulator, POLARIS, is used in this study to simulate travel in the 20-county Chicago region with a shared AV (SAV) mobility option. Using this framework, the effect of an SAV fleet on system performance when constrained to serve within geofences is studied under four distinct scenarios: service restricted to the city, to the city plus suburban core, to the core plus exurban areas, and to the entire region - along with the choice of dynamic ridesharing (DRS) versus solo travel in an SAV. Results indicate that service areas need a balanced mix of trip generators and attractors, and an SAV fleet's empty VMT (eVMT) can be noticeably reduced through suitable geofencing and DRS. Geofences can also help lower response times, reduce systemwide VMT across all modes, and ensure uniform access to SAVs. DRS is most useful in lowering VMT and %eVMT that arises from sprawled land development, but with insufficient demand to share rides, savings from the use of geofences is higher. Geofences targeting neighborhoods with high trip density bring about low response times and %eVMT, but fleet sizes in these regions need to be designed for uniformly low response times throughout a large region, as opposed to maximizing vehicle use in a 24-hour

AB In recent times, technological advancement boosts the desire of utilizing the autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in both civil and military sectors. Among various UAVs, the ability of rotary wing UAVs (RUAVs) in vertical take-off and landing, to hover and perform quick maneuvering attract researchers to develop models fully autonomous control framework. The majority of first principle techniques in modeling and controlling RUAV face challenges in incorporating and handling various uncertainties. Recently various fuzzy and neuro-fuzzy based intelligent systems are utilized to enhance the RUAV's modeling and control performance. However, the majority of these fuzzy systems are based on batch learning methods, have static structure, and cannot adapt to rapidly changing environments. The implication of Evolving Intelligent System based model-free data-driven techniques can be a smart option since they can adapt their structure and parameters to cope with sudden changes in the behavior of RUAVs real-time flight. They work in a single pass learning fashion which is suitable for online real-time deployment. In this paper, state of the art of various fuzzy systems from the basic fuzzy system to evolving fuzzy system, their application in a RUAV namely quadcopter with existing limitations, and possible opportunities are analyzed. Besides, a variety of first principle techniques to control the quadcopter, their impediments, and conceivable solution with recently employed evolving fuzzy controllers are reviewed.

   Abstract Owing to the harsh environment of underground mines, autonomous underground articulated vehicles (UAVs) with precise control and positioning system are particularly important. However, the ambiguity of steering characteristics hinders the development of UAVs. This study presents a model-based method to uncover the steering characteristics of a UAV. Firstly, a hybrid model of UAV was established, which included a dynamic model of articulated frames and a model of the hydraulic power steering system. Secondly, a field test of a typical UAV, a load-haul-dump (LHD) with 4 m(3) capacity, was carried out. In order to verify the correctness of the established model and the accuracy of the involved parameters, the field test results were used to verify the dynamic model in time and frequency domains. Then, the steering characteristics of the UAV were uncovered based on the verified hybrid model, and the results showed that the increased load would increase 'oversteering' under the same articulation angle and that the error of trajectory exceeded 0.3 m. In addition, the deviations of trajectories between the two frames were revealed during the transient steering process, and the maximum deviation reached 0.21 m when the velocity was 2 m/s and the articulation angle was 15 degrees. The comprehensive results indicate that the steering characteristics of UAVs cannot be ignored in regard to precise autonomous control and positioning.

AB Mapping a river's geometry provides valuable information to help understand the topology and health of an environment and deduce other attributes such as which types of surface vessels could traverse the river. While many rivers can be mapped from satellite imagery, smaller rivers that pass through dense vegetation are occluded. We develop a micro air vehicle (MAV) that operates beneath the tree line, detects and maps the river, and plans paths around three-dimensional (3D) obstacles (such as overhanging tree branches) to navigate rivers purely with onboard sensing, with no GPS and no prior map. We present the two enabling algorithms for exploration and for 3D motion planning. We extract high-level goal-points using a novel exploration algorithm that uses multiple layers of information to maximize the length of the river that is explored during a mission. We also present an efficient modification to the SPARTAN (Sparse Tangential Network) algorithm called SPARTAN-lite, which exploits geodesic properties on smooth manifolds of a tangential surface around obstacles to plan rapidly through free space. Using limited onboard resources, the exploration and planning algorithms together compute trajectories through complex unstructured and unknown terrain, a capability rarely demonstrated by flying vehicles operating over rivers or over ground. We evaluate our approach against commonly employed algorithms and compare guidance decisions made by our system to those made by a human piloting a boat carrying our system over multiple kilometers. We also present fully autonomous flights on riverine environments generating 3D maps over several hundred-meter stretches of tight winding rivers. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Transformative technologies like automated vehicles, and emerging services like mobility-on-demand and ride-sharing, are changing the ecosystem of urban mobility. Land use-transport interaction (LUTI) models provide appropriate platforms to test the impacts of such services on cities. Although these services are purported to have mixed effects on cities, there is a general consensus that these services will increase accessibility. We approach the 'car-lite' policy through this lens of increased accessibility, and base this study in the city-state of Singapore. Different study areas are chosen in a manner similar to the differences-in-differences approach, in order to tease out the effects of initial neighborhood vacancy rate, vehicle-free behavior, and tight markets on policy impacts. We also design different scenarios that represent varying market reactions to the policy, and compare them to a baseline where the car-lite policy is never implemented. Study areas that are initially less 'tight' (i.e., have higher vacancy rates and lower vehicle-free rates) are found to have significantly larger transitions to vehicle-free behavior. Additionally, our finding of accessibility-induced gentrification speaks to the importance of considering the endogeneity in housing and mobility choices while formulating policies that may seemingly feel relevant only to the transportation realm. Providing appropriate mixes of housing typologies with adequate affordable housing, in addition to restricting car use for higher-income car-owning households, are suggested as strategies for designing car-lite neighborhoods.

AB Aiming to the applications from security surveillance, military operational capabilities to the content and package delivery, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has a successfully created his space in the available technologies. The compact sized powerful flying robots are wirelessly controlled and are capable to complete tasks with and without direct human intervention. UAVs however still face serious challenges that limit the dream of complete autonomous unmanned flying machines. The key challenges include path planning and obstacle avoidance of these unmanned flying robots that are unavoidable while performing the application-specific functionalities both in indoor and outdoor environments. In this manuscript with a survey, we investigate the state-of-the-art UAV path planning algorithms and obstacle avoidance techniques. We have also summarized and compared the schemes in tabular form. In addition, current and future research directions and challenges are also discussed, showing the prospective research directions.

AB Dynamic lateral lane change (DLLC) control of automated and connected vehicles (ACVs) is challenging because of the time-varying and complex properties of the traffic environment. This study proposes a DLLC control strategy combining dynamic trajectory planning and tracking. According to the real-time longitudinal accelerations and velocities of multiple surrounding vehicles, as well as the real-time states of the ACVs, the safe trajectory reference of DLLC is obtained by solving a case-dependent constrained optimisation problem. The lane changing efficiency, vehicle stability and passenger comfort are considered jointly in the trajectory planning. Then, the dynamic trajectory reference is tracked through a gain-scheduling control algorithm combining previewed trajectory feed-forward and ACVs states feedback. Gain-scheduling control algorithm based on a linear time-varying form is utilised to achieve the precise control of the different velocities and improve the real-time ability of the algorithm. The proposed strategy is tested through software and hardware-in-loop experiments, and in different test scenarios. The results of simulations and experiments show that the proposed control strategy can achieve a satisfactory performance of DLLC. The lane changing efficiency, safety, passenger comfort and vehicle stability are verified in complex traffic environments.

AB Path planning models are often only founded by geometric calculations and do not consider the vehicle's limitations. In critical situations, path following is crucial, as a departure from the trajectory can have significant consequences. It is therefore necessary to define trajectories which the vehicle has the capacity to follow, i.e. feasible trajectories. This paper presents a framework for feasible trajectory generation for use in minimum time manoeuvres (MTM). The feasibility of trajectories is evaluated against a Quasi-Steady-State (QSS) acceleration envelope and jerk constraints. The vehicle's dynamics feasibility is assessed through a new exact relation of vehicle trajectory curvature that is expressed relative to a track reference line. The physical restriction of these constraints, relative to the vehicle's transient capabilities, implies that QSS feasibility assessments also extend to the transient vehicle. Minimum curvature trajectories are also reviewed. Results are presented for four examples. First, a constant radius example highlights differences in the minimum curvature cost models. The second example compares minimum curvature trajectories against MTM solutions for the Tempelhof Airport Street Circuit (Berlin), resulting in a new minimum curvature objective. The last two examples, straight road and Adria International Raceway, show that the feasible trajectory model is a good predictor of the QSS handling limits, indicating its ability to define feasible trajectories. The maximum spread of results is $ 3.2\% $ 3.2%. A friction ellipse model is additionally presented for comparison against the Normal-Tangential-Acceleration (NTA) surface. Friction ellipse results showed to be comparable if the acceleration envelope alignment is sufficient.

AB This paper investigates the problem of tracking target control of a nonlinear system in the context of cyber-physical systems for connected autonomous vehicles with external unknown disturbances. A new robust tracking strategy via backstepping sliding-mode control is proposed. First, a connected nonlinear vehicle dynamical model with disturbances is constructed. Then, a disturbance observer is presented to approximate the unknown disturbances when the derivative of the disturbance is bounded. This paper has proved that the error of the observation can converge to zero in finite time. Third, a tracking control method is designed which combines the backstepping method with the sliding-mode method. According to the method, the estimated values of interference are used as a priori knowledge. Furthermore, the stability of the designed control strategy is demonstrated through using the Lyapunov theory. Finally, simulation experiments are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approaches.

AB Autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistant systems (ADAS) are receiving notable attention as research fields in both academia and private industry. Some decision-making systems use sets of logical rules to map knowledge of the ego-vehicle and its environment into actions the ego-vehicle should take. However, such rulesets can be difficult to create - for example by manually writing them - due to the complexity of traffic as an operating environment. Furthermore, the building blocks of the rules must be defined. One common solution to this is using an ontology specifically aimed at describing traffic concepts and their hierarchy. These ontologies must have a certain expressive power to enable construction of useful rules. We propose a process of generating sets of explanatory rules for ADAS applications from data using ontology as a base vocabulary and present a ruleset generated as a result of our experiments that is correct for the scope of the experiment.

AB This paper proposes a two-phase algorithm for multi-criteria selection of packet forwarding in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), which communicate with the control station through commercial mobile network. The selection of proper data forwarding in the two radio link: From UAV to the antenna and from the antenna to the control station, are independent but subject to constrains. The proposed approach is independent of the intra-domain forwarding, so it may be useful for a number of different scenarios of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles connectivity (e.g., a swarm of drones). In the implementation developed in this paper, the connection is served by three different mobile network operators in order to ensure reliable connectivity. The proposed algorithm makes use of Machine Learning tools that are properly trained for predicting the behavior of the link connectivity during the flight duration. The results presented in the last section validate the algorithm and the training process of the machines.

AB As a challenging and highly complex problem, the trajectory planning for unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) focuses on optimising flight trajectory under such constraints as kinematics and complicated battlefield environment. An online case-based trajectory planning strategy is proposed in this study to achieve rapid control variables solution of UCAV flight trajectory for the of delivery airborne guided bombs. Firstly, with an analysis of the ballistic model of airborne guided bombs, the trajectory planning model of UCAVs is established with launch acceptable region (LAR) as a terminal constraint. Secondly, a case-based planning strategy is presented, which involves four cases depending on the situation of UCAVs at the current moment. Finally, the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed planning strategy is validated by numerical simulations, and the results show that the presented strategy is suitable for UCAV performing airborne guided delivery missions in dynamic environments.

AB This paper presents the regulation and trajectory tracking for a Micro Coaxial Rocket Helicopter (MCR UAV), as well as the control of a mini aircraft. The former vehicle has the characteristic of performing hover and forward flight while the latter vehicle is considered as an external air transporter for the MCR UAV. For control purposes, the helicopter stabilization is based on sliding mode controllers which avoid the chattering generated during the flight and allow the MCR UAV to perform tracking of smooth trajectories, Furthermore a PD controller stabilizes the aircraft in order to execute semi-autonomous flight. A flight computer for these aerial vehicles consists of a homemade embedded system, low-cost sensors, and signal conditioning circuits, analog filters and actuator. The proposed control algorithms are implemented on the embedded system. Simulation and experimental results show the good performance of the developed system during the flight.

TI Adaptive on-line planning of environmental sampling missions with a team

AB This contribution introduces two algorithms for adaptive on-line planning of oceanographic missions to be performed in cooperation by a team of AUVs. The mission goal is defined in terms of accuracy in the reconstruction of the environmental field to be sampled. Adaptive cooperative behaviour is achieved by each vehicle in terms of locally evaluating the smoothness of the sampled field, and selecting the next sampling point in order to achieve the desired accuracy; smoothness evaluation and accuracy estimation have been proposed either in terms of analytical formulation related to field estimation with RBFs, or in terms of empirically derived fuzzy-like rules. Simulative results show that the vehicles team does behave as expected, increasing the spatial sampling rate as an increase in the environmental variability is detected. The number of samples required by both algorithms is sensibly inferior to those needed by sampling the area at equally spaced locations, as in the case of off-line, nonadaptive planners.

AB To be successful, automated vehicles (AVs) need to be able to manoeuvre in mixed traffic in a way that will be accepted by road users, and maximises traffic safety and efficiency. A likely prerequisite for this success is for AVs to be able to communicate effectively with other road users in a complex traffic environment. The current study, conducted as part of the European project interACT, investigates the communication strategies used by drivers and pedestrians while crossing the road at six observed locations, across three European countries. In total, 701 road user interactions were observed and annotated, using an observation protocol developed for this purpose. The observation protocols identified 20 event categories, observed from the approaching vehicles/drivers and pedestrians. These included information about movement, looking behaviour, hand gestures, and signals used, as well as some demographic data. These observations illustrated that explicit communication techniques, such as honking, flashing headlights by drivers, or hand gestures by drivers and pedestrians, rarely occurred. This observation was consistent across sites. In addition, a follow-on questionnaire, administered to a sub-set of the observed pedestrians after crossing the road, found that when contemplating a crossing, pedestrians were more likely to use vehicle-based behaviour, rather than communication cues from the driver. Overall, the findings suggest that vehicle-based movement information such as yielding cues are more likely to be used by pedestrians while crossing the road, compared to explicit communication cues from drivers, although some cultural differences were observed. The implications of these findings are discussed with respect to design of suitable external interfaces and communication of intent by future automated vehicles.

AB This paper studies control strategies for adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems in battery electric vehicles (BEVs). A hierarchical control structure is adopted for the ACC system, and the structure contains an upper controller and a lower controller. This paper focuses on the upper controller. In the upper controller, model predictive control (MPC) is applied for optimizing multiple objectives in the car-following process. In addition, multiple objectives, including safety, tracking, comfort, and energy economy, can be transformed into a symmetric objective function with constraints in MPC. In the objective function, the corresponding weight matrix for the optimization of multiple objectives is implemented in symmetric form to reduce the computational complexity. The weights in the weight matrix are usually set to be constant. However, the motion states of the own vehicle and the front vehicle change with respect to time during a car-following process, resulting in variation of the driving conditions. MPCs with constant weights do not adapt well to changes in driving conditions, which limits the performance of the ACC system. Therefore, a strategy for weight adjustment is proposed in order to improve the tracking performance, in which some weights in MPC can be adjusted according to the relative velocity of two vehicles in real time. The simulation experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the strategy for weight adjustment. Based on achieving the other control objectives, the ACC system with the weight adjustment has better tracking performance than the ACC system with the constant weight. While the tracking is improved, the energy economy is also improved.

AB On the battlefield, early detection of armored vehicles can have a positive effect. Because according to this issue, timely and appropriate reactions can be done. The purpose of this study is to achieve the required algorithm in the vehicle control system by considering the car sensor vision, which is necessary to identify and determine the equipment needed to control the military drone based on car sensor vision. Today, the use of wireless networks, especially inter-vehicle wireless networks, in military applications is inevitable. Therefore, in the first step of this research, a new method has been proposed to control and steer unmanned vehicles based on car vision. In the proposed method, two 180-degree panoramic cameras with horizontal vision are used from the recorded images. The simulation results of the proposed method show increased accuracy and reduced implementation cost compared to using LIDAR and RADAR technologies. In the second step, a new approach is introduced to identify four common classes of armored vehicles (tanks, personnel carriers, firing tanks, and military vehicles) that are more likely to be present on battlefields. For this purpose, the latest image processing methods, which is deep learning, have been used. The results of the simulation of the proposed approach show the high accuracy of the proposed approach in detecting armored vehicles in a short time. In the third step of this research, a new method has been proposed to increase the connection of wireless networks. In the proposed method, queue theory is used and the results of the simulation of the proposed method show the high efficiency of the method. As a result, accurate and fast detection with unique features makes the users of the system superior.

AB The advent of automated vehicles (AVs) will provide opportunities for safer, smoother, and smarter road transportation. During the transition from the current human-driven vehicle (HV) to a fully AV traffic environment, there will be a mixed traffic flow including both HVs and AVs. The impact of introducing AVs into existing traffic, however, has not yet been fully understood. In this paper, we advance this understanding by conducting mixed traffic safety evaluation from the perspective of car-following behavior using real-world AV operational data of mixed traffic. To understand how the AVs impact other vehicles on the road, we analyzed the operational behaviors of HV-following-HV, AV-following-HV, and HV-following-AV. A selected car-following model is calibrated, and results show that there are significant differences between the HV-following-HV and the other two groups, indicating safe AV behavior and changes in HV behavior (i.e. less aggressive, safer) after the introduction of AVs into the traffic. Additionally, to understand AV behavioral safety, we investigate behavior predictions (one of the most critical inputs for AVs to make car-following decisions) of AVs and their surrounding vehicles using a mature baseline model and a new Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) framework. The result shows potential risks of inaccurate predictions of the baseline model and the necessity to consider additional factors, such as vehicle interactions and driver behavior, into the prediction for risk mitigation. Arterial vehicle trajectory data from the Lyft Level 5 Dataset is applied to test the proposed methodological framework to understand the car-following safety risks of HVs and AVs in the mixed traffic stream.

AB The development of electric vehicles can help reduce the use of fossil fuels and further mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A comprehensive method is proposed for estimating the GHG mitigation potential of passenger battery electric vehicles (PBEVs) continentally and globally, considering the electricity consumption, energy transition, and other main influencing factors. The future energy transition is considered to change the electricity generation structures, improve the share of clean power, and further increase the GHG mitigation potential of electric vehicles based on a life-cycle analysis. An uncertainty analysis is performed to investigate the main influencing factors, such as energy intensity, battery size, autonomous vehicles, charging infrastructure, carpooling and ridesharing, and the development of other competitive vehicles on the electricity consumption and mitigation potential. Results show that the global stock of PBEVs will reach 1.2 x 10(8) and 1.0 x 10(9) vehicles in 2030 and 2050, respectively, and the global electricity consumption will be 250-480 TWh in 2030 and 1140-2840 TWh in 2050, equivalent of saving 3.4-6.5 x 10(8) barrel of gasoline in 2030 and 1.6-3.9 x 10(9) barrel of gasoline in 2050. The calculated global GHG mitigation potentials of PBEVs are 40-215 Mt CO(2)e and 340-1380 Mt CO(2)e in 2030 and 2050, respectively, which will accelerate the decarbonization transition in the transport sector and help achieve the global temperature control goals in the Paris Agreement and sustainable development goals.

AB Automatic vehicle following and cruising under all road geometry characteristics (curvature, slope, and superelevation) and traffic conditions without putting the vehicle occupants or other vehicles in unsafe situations are fundamental for the success of autonomous vehicles. Despite the advances in sensor technologies, we do not have the accuracy needed to guarantee safety under all driving conditions. In fact, for certain road geometries such as going around sharp curves, forward-looking beams and vision cannot see what is around the curve no matter how accurate they are. To ensure safety and driving comfort, the following challenges need to be addressed under all road geometry characteristics and traffic conditions: Effective detection of in-path objects, collision avoidance with objects not visible with exteroceptive sensors, adopting a cautious approach in high noise environment and avoiding high longitudinal and lateral accelerations for driving comfort. This paper presents a methodology and control design that meets these challenges. It incorporates geo-referenced maps to identify road geometries and detect in-path objects. It analyses the impact of noise on sensor data and uses a probabilistic approach to determine the desired velocity. It then proposes a vehicle following controller that achieves robust vehicle following and cruising under all road geometries and in particular sharp curves. In the case of sharp curves, where a possible obstacle is not visible by the on-board sensors, slowing down to a certain speed preemptively to have time to stop is part of the proposed methodology. Simulations show that proposed system fulfills all safety and comfort constraints.

AB Security of the smart grid is at risk when the vulnerabilities of the electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure is not addressed properly. As vehicles are becoming smarter and connected, their risk of being compromised is increasing. On various occasions and venues, hacking into smart or autonomous vehicles have been shown to be possible. For most of the time, a compromised vehicle poses a threat to the driver and other vehicles. On the other hand, when the vehicle is electric, the attack may spread to the power grid infrastructure starting from the EV supply equipment (EVSE) all the way up to the utility systems. Traditional isolation-based protection schemes do not work well in smart grid since electricity services have availability constraints and few of the components have physical backups. In this paper, we propose a mixed integer linear programming model that jointly optimizes security risk and equipment availability in the interdependent power and EV infrastructure. We adopt an epidemic attack model to mimic malware propagation. We assume malware spreads during EV charging when an EV is charged from an infected EVSE and then travels and recharges at another EVSE. In addition, it spreads through the communication network of EVSEs. The proposed response model aims to isolate a subset of compromised and likely compromised EVSEs. The response model minimizes the risk of attack propagation while providing a satisfactory level of equipment availability to supply demand. Our analysis shows the theoretical and practical bounds for the proposed response model in smart grid in the face of attacks to the EV infrastructure.

ID INJURY SEVERITY; CLASSIFICATION
AB Autonomous Vehicles (AV) technology is emerging. Field tests on public roads have been on going in several states in the US as well as in Europe and Asia. During the US public road tests, crashes with AV involved happened, which becomes a concern to the public. Most previous studies on AV safety relied heavily on assessing drivers' performance and behaviors in a simulation environment and developing automated driving system performance in a closed field environment. However, contributing factors and the mechanism of AV-related crashes have not been comprehensively and quantitatively investigated due to the lack of field AV crash data. By harnessing California's Report of Traffic Collision Involving an Autonomous Vehicle Database, which includes the AV crash data from 2014 to 2018, this paper investigates by far the most current and complete AV crash database in the US using statistical modeling approaches that involve both ordinal logistic regression and CART classification tree. The quantitative analysis based on ordinal logistic regression and CART models has successfully explored the mechanism of AV-related crash, via both perspectives of crash severity and collision types. Particularly, the CART model reveals and visualize the hierarchical structure of the AV crash mechanism with knowledge of how these traffic, roadway, and environmental contributing factors can lead to crashes of various serveries and collision types. Statistical analysis results indicate that crash severity significantly increases if the AV is responsible for the crash. The highway is identified as the location where severe injuries are likely to happen. AV collision types are affected by whether the vehicle is on automated driving mode, whether the crashes involve pedestrians/cyclists, as well as the roadway environment. The method used in this research provides a proven approach to statistically analyze and understand AV safety issues. And this benefit is potential be even enhanced with an increasing sample size of AV-related crashes records in the future. The comprehensive knowledge obtained ultimately facilitates assessing and improving safety performance of automated vehicles.

AB Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) has emerged as a novel generalized multiple access technology which can control the interference in multi-user communication systems. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has also been proven to improve the spectral efficiency in the next-generation (beyond 5 G (B5G) and 6 G) wireless communication networks. Thus, in this paper, we explore the RSMA scheme for RIS-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based multi-user vehicular communication network in the presence of co-channel interference. The communication between the UAV and the desired vehicle takes place through an RIS along with the direct link and is interfered by multiple interfering vehicles operating in the same spectrum. After deriving the approximate cumulative distribution function (CDF) of common and private stream signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) at the desired vehicle in the interference limited scenario, we obtain an expression for the average outage probability (AOP) over the complete flying duration of the UAV. Furthermore, the optimum RSMA power allocation coefficients in each time slot of UAV flight duration are obtained by minimizing the Sum-AOP over all the desired vehicles. The performance of the proposed RSMA based RIS-aided vehicular communication network is compared with (a) RSMA based network without RIS and (b) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based RIS-aided counterpart. The numerical results reveal the superiority of RSMA over NOMA and the significance of deploying RIS in considered vehicular communication network. The analytical results are corroborated with Monte Carlo simulations.

SO SUSTAINABILITY

ID STABILITY ANALYSIS
AB Autonomous driving technology and vehicle-to-vehicle communication technology make the hybrid driving of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and regular vehicles (RVs) a long-existing phenomenon in the coming future. Among the existing studies, IDM models are mostly used to study the performance of homogeneous traffic flow. To explore the stability of mixed traffic flow, an extended intelligent driver model (IDM) based car-following model was proposed for mixed traffic flow (MTF) with both CAVs and RVs, considering the headway, the speed and acceleration of multiple front vehicles, as well as the response characteristics of RV drivers. Through the linear stability analysis, the criterion for the stability of MTFs was derived, and the relationship among the penetration rate of CAVs, equilibrium velocity and traffic stability in MTF are discussed. Based on the above theoretical model, a numerical simulation was conducted in two typical scenarios of starting and braking. The results showed that, at the microscopic scale, the vehicle in the Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) mode could significantly decelerate in response to the interference from other vehicles in the same traffic environment. At the macroscopic scale, as the penetration rate of CAVs increased, the overall acceleration fluctuation of the traffic flow decreased. At the same penetration rate of CAVs, the higher density of CAVs coincided with the higher stability of the MTF. When the penetration rate of CAVs was 50%, the degree of distribution had the greatest impact on the MTF. When the penetration rate of CAVs exceeded 70%, the degree of distribution had little impact on the MTF. This research can provide basic theoretical support for the management and control of MTF in the future.

AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore the influence of the electronic throttle (ET) dynamics and the average speed of multiple preceding vehicles on the stability of traffic flow. Design/methodology/approach An extended car-following model integrating the ET dynamics and the average speed of multiple preceding vehicles is presented in this paper. The novel model's stability conditions are obtained by using the thought of control theory, and the modified Korteweg-de Vries equation is inferred in terms of the nonlinear analysis method. In addition, some simulation experiments are implemented to explore the properties of traffic flow, and the results of these experiments confirm the correctness of theoretical analysis. Findings In view of the results of theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, traffic flow will become more stable when the average speed and ET dynamics of multiple preceding vehicles are considered, and the stability of traffic flow will also be enhanced by increasing the number of preceding vehicles considered. Research limitations/implications This study leaves the factors such as the mixed traffic flow, the multilane and so on out of account in real road environment, which more or less influences the traffic flow's stability, so the real traffic environment is not fully reflected. Originality/value There is little research integrating ET dynamics and the average velocity of multiple preceding vehicles to study the properties of traffic flow. The enhanced model constructed in this study can better reflect the real traffic, which can also give some theoretical reference for the development of connected and autonomous vehicles.

ID CALIBRATION METHOD
AB Autonomous and accurate acquisition of the position and azimuth of the vehicle is critical to the combat effectiveness of land-fighting vehicles. The integrated navigation system, consisting of a strap-down inertial navigation system (SINS) and odometer (OD), is commonly applied in vehicles. In the SINS/OD integrated system, the odometer is installed around the vehicle's wheel, while SINS is usually installed on the base of the vehicle. The distance along SINS and OD would cause a velocity difference when the vehicle maneuvers, which may lead to a significant influence on the integration positioning accuracy. Furthermore, SINS navigation errors, especially azimuth error, would diverge over time due to gyro drifts and accelerometer biases. The azimuth error would cause the divergence of dead-reckoning positioning errors with the distance that the vehicle drives. To solve these problems, an integrated positioning and orientation method based on the configuration of SINS and couple odometers was proposed in this paper. The proposed method designed a high precision integrated navigation algorithm, which compensated the lever arm effect to eliminate the velocity difference between SINS and odometers. At the same time, by using the measured information of couple odometers, azimuth reference was calculated and used as an external measurement to suppress SINS azimuth error's divergence over time, thus could further improve the navigation precision of the integrated system, especially the orientation accuracy. The performance of the proposed method was verified by simulations. The results demonstrated that SINS/2ODs integrated system could achieve a positioning accuracy of 0.01% D (total mileage) and orientation accuracy of +/- 30 '' by using SINS with 0.01 degrees/h Fiber-Optic Gyroscope (FOGs) and 50 mu g accelerometers.

AB Shuttles that operate without an onboard driver are currently being developed and tested in various projects worldwide. However, there is a paucity of knowledge on the determinants of acceptance of driverless shuttles in large cross-national samples. In the present study, we surveyed 10,000 respondents on the acceptance of driverless vehicles and sociodemographic characteristics, using a 94-item online questionnaire. After data filtering, data of 7,755 respondents from 116 countries were retained. Respondents reported that they would enjoy taking a ride in a driverless vehicle (mean = 4.90 on a scale from 1 = disagree strongly to 6 = agree strongly). We further found that the scores on the questionnaire items were most appropriately explained through a general acceptance component, which had loadings of about 0.7 for items pertaining to the usefulness of driverless vehicles and loadings between 0.5 and 0.6 for items concerning the intention to use, ease of use, pleasure, and trust in driverless vehicles, as well as knowledge of mobility-related developments. Additional components were identified as thrill seeking, wanting to be in control manually, supporting a car-free environment, and being comfortable with technology. Correlations between sociodemographic characteristics and general acceptance scores were small (<0.20), yet interpretable (e.g., people who reported difficulty with finding a parking space were more accepting towards driverless vehicles). Finally, we found that the GDP per capita of the respondents' country was predictive of countries' mean general acceptance score (rho = -0.48 across 43 countries with 25 or more respondents). In conclusion, self-reported acceptance of driverless vehicles is more strongly determined by domain-specific attitudes than by sociodemographic characteristics. We recommend further research, using objective measures, into the hypothesis that national characteristics are a predictor of the acceptance of driverless vehicles.

AB The cordial existence of robots and humans in the same workstation is an important aspect of the deployment of autonomous systems. Usually, robots are integrated with auxiliary sensors for monitoring the surroundings and tackling unexpected actions. The incorporation of LiDAR (light detection and ranging) and SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) has gained the researcher's attention these days. The current study aims at developing a collision-free motion for an autonomous robot to ensure the least possible travel period at internodes. First, a SLAM-based algorithm for a static environment is proposed. A low-cost microcontroller Arduino UNO is used here along with LiDAR VL53L0X and is integrated with MATLAB to store and display the acquired data. The A* algorithm is used to navigate between the shortest paths on the obtained map. The robot is also integrated with radio frequency identification (RFID) sensors to automate the process. The proposed system would be useful for material handling, assistance, and cleaning purpose in large warehouses or households.

AB In literature, Extended Object Tracking (EOT) algorithms developed for autonomous driving predominantly provide obstacles state estimation in cartesian coordinates in the Vehicle Reference Frame. However, in many scenarios, state representation in road-aligned curvilinear coordinates is preferred when implementing autonomous driving subsystems like cruise control, lane-keeping assist, platooning, etc. This paper proposes a Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density (GM-PHD) filter with an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) estimator that provides obstacle state estimates in curvilinear road coordinates. We employ a hybrid sensor fusion architecture between Lidar and Radar sensors to obtain rich measurement point representations for EOT. The measurement model for the UKF estimator is developed with the integration of coordinate conversion from curvilinear road coordinates to cartesian coordinates by using cubic hermit spline road model. The proposed algorithm is validated through Matlab Driving Scenario Designer simulation and experimental data collected at Monza Eni Circuit. The Experimental Dataset will be made publicly available upon the paper acceptance.

AB Five hundred survey responses on consumer acceptance of autonomous delivery robots (ADRs) were collected because the pandemic has increased the emphasis on contactless deliveries, spurring some interest in ADRs to perform last-mile deliveries in urban cities. To examine consumers' intention to adopt ADRs, a comprehensive theoretical model grounded on the Health Belief Model and Task-Technology Fit Model was presented and structural equation modeling was applied to examine the survey data. The analysis revealed that the constructs from both theories have significant effects on outcome expectations and task-technology fit. Additionally, outcome expectations and task-technology fit are strong predictors of consumers' intention, as indicated by their direct and indirect effects. Thus, this study enriches existing research by interpreting consumers' intention to adopt ADRs through health and technology perspectives. It also provides practical implications and policy recommendations for urban planning and design.

AB Recent advancements in radiation detection and computer vision have enabled small unmanned aerial systems (sUASs) to produce 3-D radiation maps, for example, composed of gamma rays and neutrons, in real time. Currently, these state-of-the-art systems require two operators: one to pilot the sUAS and another operator to monitor the detected radiation. In this work, we present a system that integrates real-time 3-D radiation visualization with semi-autonomous sUAS control. Our virtual reality (VR) interface enables a single operator to define trajectories using waypoints to abstract complex flight control and utilize the semi-autonomous maneuvering capabilities of the sUAS. The interface also displays a fused radiation visualization and environment map, thereby enabling simultaneous remote operation and radiation monitoring by a single operator. This interface and its underlying framework serves as the basis for development of a single system that can deploy and autonomously control a fleet of radiation-mapping sUASs.

The actuator control command and data communication protocols comply with the ISO 11783. The project aims to develop an autonomous agricultural system for operation in the paddy field. The automated rice transplanter presented in this paper is the first stage in achieving the project objective. This paper focuses on the development of sensor and main computer connections to the operating autonomous unit and the use of common control protocols for each of the automated machines. A simple steering control algorithm was used for straight traveling. The automated rice transplanter made a turn at the headland of the paddy field and moved to the next desired path. After 12 straight operations, the rms lateral deviation was observed to be less than 0.04 m and the rms heading angle error was less than 3.6 deg. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID MODEL; PREDICTION
AB Autonomous vehicles for the intention of human behavior of the estimated traffic participants and their interaction is the main problem in automatic driving system. Classical cognitive theory assumes that the behavior of human traffic participants is completely reasonable when studying estimation of intention and interaction. However, according to the quantum cognition and decision theory as well as practical traffic cases, human behavior including traffic behavior is often unreasonable, which violates classical cognition and decision theory. Based on the quantum cognitive theory, this paper studies the cognitive problem of pedestrian crossing. Through the case analysis, it is proved that the Quantum-like Bayesian (QLB) model can consider the reasonability of pedestrians when crossing the street compared with the classical probability model, being more consistent with the actual situation. The experiment of trajectory prediction proves that the QLB model can cover the edge events in interactive scenes compared with the data-driven Social-LSTM model, being more consistent with the real trajectory. This paper provides a new reference for the research on the cognitive problem of intention on bounded rational behavior of human traffic participants in autonomous driving.

AB The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a powerful tool used to express many logistics problems, yet unlike other vehicle routing challenges, agricultural field work consists of machine paths that completely cover a field. In this work, the allocation and ordering of field paths among a number of available machines has been transformed into a VRP that enables optimization of completion time for the entire field. A basic heuristic algorithm (a modified form of the common Clarke-Wright algorithm) and a meta-heuristic algorithm, Tabu Search, Were employed for optimization. Both techniques were evaluated through computer simulations in two fields: a hypothetical basic rectangular field and a more complex, real-world field. Field completion times and effective field capacity were calculated for cases when 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 vehicles were used simultaneously. Although the Tabu Search method required more than two hours to produce its solution on an Intel i7 processor compared to less than one second for the method based on Clarke-Wright, Tabu Search provided better solutions that resulted in reduced field completion times and increased effective field capacity. The benefit provided by Tabu Search was larger in the more complex field and as the number of vehicles increased. With ten vehicles 'in the real-world field, the benefit provided by Tabu Search over the modified Clarke-Wright resulted in reduced completion time of 32%, but even with only three vehicles a 15% reduction was obtained. While ten vehicles may only be applicable with future autonomous machines, simultaneous usage of three machines is not uncommon in current production. As producers consider using multiple machines to improve field completion times and effective field capacity, optimization of the vehicle routing will play an important role in ensuring those improvements are fully realized.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are expected to improve traffic safety effectively at signalized intersections. Considerable studies have been conducted to investigate the benefits of CAVs in improving traffic mobility and efficiency. However, in most previous research, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication have been considered separately rather than concurrently, to study the characteristics of CAVs, resulting in the potential of CAVs not being fully exploited and inconsistency with reality. In this paper, an integrated communication system of CAVs (ICSC), which incorporates V2V and V2I communication, is proposed, to assess traffic safety at signalized intersections. In this study, the intelligent driver model (IDM) is used to approximate V2V communication between a subject CAV and preceding CAVs. A reinforcement learning algorithm is adopted to model V2I communication between a CAV and a traffic light. The traffic safety effect of ICSC, V2V-only, and V2I-only scenarios is evaluated for different market penetration rates (MPRs). The results show that the ICSC scenario significantly reduces traffic conflicts and outperforms V2V-only, V2I-only, and benchmark scenarios when the MPR is equal to or higher than 50% with different surrogate safety measures (SSMs), such as time-exposed deceleration (TED) to avoid crashing, time exposed time-to-collision (TET), and use of a spacing gap (SGAP). Moreover, the mobility effect of the ICSC scenario is studied, and appears to increase average speed and reduce delay time. Finally, the results suggest that the ICSC can improve traffic safety and mobility concurrently and exploit the potentials of CAVs at signalized intersections.

AB Cooperative perception, or collective perception (CP), is an emerging and promising technology for intelligent transportation systems (ITS). It enables an ITS station (ITS-S) to share its local perception information with others by means of vehicle-to-X (V2X) communication, thereby achieving improved efficiency and safety in road transportation. In this paper, we present our recent progress on the development of a connected and automated vehicle (CAV) and intelligent roadside unit (IRSU). The main contribution of the work lies in investigating and demonstrating the use of CP service within intelligent infrastructure to improve awareness of vulnerable road users (VRU) and thus safety for CAVs in various traffic scenarios. We demonstrate in experiments that a connected vehicle (CV) can "see" a pedestrian around the corners. More importantly, we demonstrate how CAVs can autonomously and safely interact with walking and running pedestrians, relying only on the CP information from the IRSU through vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. This is one of the first demonstrations of urban vehicle automation using only CP information. We also address in the paper the handling of collective perception messages (CPMs) received from the IRSU, and passing them through a pipeline of CP information coordinate transformation with uncertainty, multiple road user tracking, and eventually path planning/decision-making within the CAV. The experimental results were obtained with manually driven CV, fully autonomous CAV, and an IRSU retrofitted with vision and laser sensors and a road user tracking system.

AB This paper summarizes and synthesizes the existing literature relevant to pedestrian receptivity toward Fully Automated Vehicles (FAVs). Objectives of this review are to identify research gaps that need to be filled and to propose a roadmap for future research. Since FAVs are operated by software and hardware, with no human driver required, interactions between other road users and FAVs must be understood, and potential risks must be addressed. This is especially true for pedestrians, who often exhibit unpredictable behavior and are one of the most vulnerable road-user groups. A comprehensive review was conducted of 1) different aspects of pedestrian interaction with forthcoming fully automated vehicles, and 2) the existing research approaches ( surveys and simulator studies) for investigating risky pedestrian behavior as well as public acceptance of fully automated vehicles. The review identified three major gaps in pedestrian research: 1) lack of a pedestrian behavior questionnaire for FAV research, 2) lack of a validated pedestrian simulator for FAV research, and 3) lack of research investigating pedestrian design suggestions for FAVs. A future research roadmap to facilitate investigating pedestrian receptivity toward FAVs was designed. Achieving pedestrian acceptance of FAVs will require investigation of pedestrian risks and needs by transportation researchers and communication of the results to vehicle manufacturers and regulatory agencies. This review will be useful to transportation researchers and automated vehicle manufacturers to help guide planning for future design and production of FAVs in order to ensure their successful implementation.

AB Road accidents can be effectively reduced by broadcasting basic safety messages (BSMs) of vehicles in Cellular V2X (C-V2X). However, with the increase of the number of C-V2X devices, the collision probability of BSMs at a fixed transmission frequency increases due to limited spectrum resources. In this letter, the transmission frequency adjustment mechanism (TFAM) based on channel busy ratio (CBR) is proposed to maintain the timeliness of BSMs. First, the CBR is estimated based on BSM transmission frequency and sensing occupancy probability considering channel fading. To quantify the performance of C-V2X communication, the performance metric freshness of information (FOI) is defined, which comprehensively trades off the reliability and latency of BSMs. Furthermore, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize FOI. We solve the optimization problem to derive the optimal transmission frequency. Simulation results show that the proposed TFAM enables vehicles to exchange BSMs with minimum FOI.

AB For UAV-aided wireless systems, online path planning attracts much attention recently. To better adapt to the real-time dynamic environment, for the first time, we propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based path planning scheme. In details, we consider a single UAV acts as a mobile server to provide computation tasks offloading services for a set of mobile users on the ground, where the movement of ground users follows a Random Way Point model. Our model aims at maximizing the average throughput under energy consumption and user fairness constraints, and the proposed time-saving MCTS algorithm can further improve the performance. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a larger average throughput and a faster convergence performance compared with the baseline algorithms of Q-learning and Deep Q-Network.

AB Research on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) has been increasingly popular in the past decades, and UAVs have been widely used in industrial inspection, remote sensing for mapping & surveying, rescuing, and so on. Nevertheless, the limited autonomous navigation capability severely hampers the application of UAVs in complex environments, such as GPS-denied areas. Previously, researchers mainly focused on the use of laser or radar sensors for UAV navigation. With the rapid development of computer vision, vision-based methods, which utilize cheaper and more flexible visual sensors, have shown great advantages in the field of UAV navigation. The purpose of this article is to present a comprehensive literature review of the vision-based methods for UAV navigation. Specifically on visual localization and mapping, obstacle avoidance and path planning, which compose the essential parts of visual navigation. Furthermore, throughout this article, we will have an insight into the prospect of the UAV navigation and the challenges to be faced.

ID CONSENSUS
AB The emerging branch of micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) has attracted a great interest for their indoor navigation capabilities, but they require a high quality video for tele-operated or autonomous tasks. A common problem of on-board video quality is the effect of undesired movements, so different approaches solve it with both mechanical stabilizers or video stabilizer software. Very few video stabilizer algorithms in the literature can be applied in real-time but they do not discriminate at all between intentional movements of the tele-operator and undesired ones. In this paper, a novel technique is introduced for real-time video stabilization with low computational cost, without generating false movements or decreasing the performance of the stabilized video sequence. Our proposal uses a combination of geometric transformations and outliers rejection to obtain a robust inter-frame motion estimation, and a Kalman filter based on an ANN learned model of the MAV that includes the control action for motion intention estimation.

AB This study investigated parents' willingness to allow their unaccompanied child(ren) to use emerging and future travel modes (e.g., rideshare vehicles and automated vehicles). An online survey was completed by 631 Australian respondents (M = 39.2 years, SD = 10.5 years, Male: 36.6%) who reported that they currently lived with one or more children (17 or below). Approximately one-third (37.9%) of the respondents reported a willingness to allow their child to use a rideshare vehicle alone and more than half of the respondents (57.2%) reported a willingness to allow their child to use an automated vehicle alone. Respondents who expressed willingness to allow their child to use a rideshare vehicle alone were more likely to express a willingness to use an automated vehicle alone (79.1%) compared to respondents who were unwilling to use a rideshare vehicle (43.9%), chi(2)(1) = 75.158, p < 0.001, Phi = 0.345. Two separate logistic regression models revealed key similarities and differences related to respondents' willingness to allow their unaccompanied child to use both transport modes. Respondents' willingness to allow their unaccompanied child to use a rideshare vehicle was significantly related to their previous use of a rideshare vehicle with their child, having an optimistic view of technology, annual mileage, their aberrant driving behaviours, and their desire for route-control and assurance features within the rideshare vehicle, chi(2)(7) = 159.594, p < 0.001. Respondents' willingness to allow their child to use an automated vehicle alone was significantly related to awareness of automated vehicles, education level, positive views towards technology, seeing technology to be innovative, and requirements for route control features within the automated vehicle, chi(2)(6) = 113.325, p < 0.001. Despite the potential for emerging or future travel modes to provide additional personal transportation options, these results suggest that Australian parents are unwilling to allow their unaccompanied child to use these modes of transport. These findings will have significant implications for transport planning, particularly in growing communities where pressures on parents to transport their child(ren) to activities and events with minimal adult supervision is increasing.

AB Model-based approaches to navigation, control, and fault detection that utilize precise nonlinear models of vehicle plant dynamics will enable more accurate control and navigation, assured autonomy, and more complex missions for such vehicles. This paper reports novel theoretical and experimental results addressing the problem of parameter estimation of plant and actuator models for underactuated underwater vehicles operating in 6 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) whose dynamics are modeled by finite-dimensional Newton-Euler equations. This paper reports the first theoretical approach and experimental validation to identify simultaneously plant-model parameters (parameters such as mass, added mass, hydrodynamic drag, and buoyancy) and control-actuator parameters (control-surface models and thruster models) in 6-DOF. Most previously reported studies on parameter identification assume that the control-actuator parameters are known a priori. Moreover, this paper reports the first proof of convergence of the parameter estimates to the true set of parameters for this class of vehicles under a persistence of excitation condition. The reported adaptive identification (AID) algorithm does not require instrumentation of 6-DOF vehicle acceleration, which is required by conventional approaches to parameter estimation such as least squares. Additionally, the reported AID algorithm is applicable under any arbitrary open-loop or closed-loop control law. We report simulation and experimental results for identifying the plant-model and control-actuator parameters for an L3 OceanServer Iver3 autonomous underwater vehicle. We believe this general approach to AID could be extended to apply to other classes of machines and other classes of marine, land, aerial, and space vehicles.

AB Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to improve traffic operations when they cooperatively maneuver in merging sections. State-of-the-art approaches in cooperative merging either build on heuristics solutions or prohibit mainline CAVs to change lane on multilane highways. This paper proposes a hierarchical cooperative merging control approach that ensures collision-free and traffic-efficient merging through the interaction of a maneuver planner and an operational trajectory controller. The planner predicts future vehicular trajectories, including acceleration trajectories and time instants when lane changes start, in a long horizon up to 50 seconds with a linear prediction model. It establishes the optimal dynamic vehicle sequence in each lane by minimizing predicted traffic disturbances that can propagate upstream and lead to traffic breakdown. During the process, mainline vehicles may change lane to facilitate the on-ramp merging, albeit with a higher ego cost. The operational controller follows the established instructions from the planner and regulates vehicular trajectories with model predictive control in a shorter horizon of 6 seconds. The performance of the designed hierarchical cooperative merging control approach was compared to a cooperative merging method utilizing widely used first-in-first-out rule to establish merging sequences and the same operational controller to generate vehicular trajectories. Systematic comparison shows that the proposed approach consistently results in less disturbances during merging under 528 different scenarios with different traffic states, initial vehicular states, and desired time gap settings. On average, a decrease of 39.18% in disturbances was observed.

AB The penetration of electric vehicles becomes a catalyst for the sustainability of Smart Cities. However, unregulated battery charging remains a challenge causing high energy costs, power peaks or even blackouts. This paper studies this challenge from a socio-technical perspective: social dynamics such as the participation in demand-response programs, the discomfort experienced by alternative suggested vehicle usage times and even the fairness in terms of how equally discomfort is experienced among the population are highly intertwined with Smart Grid reliability. To address challenges of such a sociotechnical nature, this paper introduces a fully decentralized and participatory learning mechanism for privacy-preserving coordinated charging control of electric vehicles that regulates three Smart Grid socio-technical aspects: (i) reliability, (ii) discomfort and (iii) fairness. In contrast to related work, a novel autonomous software agent exclusively uses local knowledge to generate energy demand plans for its vehicle that encode different battery charging regimes. Agents interact to learn and make collective decisions of which plan to execute so that power peaks and energy cost are reduced systemwide. Evaluation with real-world data confirms the improvement of drivers' comfort and fairness using the proposed planning method, while this improvement is assessed in terms of reliability and cost reduction under a varying number of participating vehicles. These findings have a significant relevance and impact for power utilities and system operator on designing more reliable and socially responsible Smart Grids with high penetration of electric vehicles.

AB It is necessary to identify takeover behavior patterns of conditional autonomous driving. In this paper, using driving simulations, takeover request lead time (5 s and 10 s) and nondriving-related tasks (working task and entertainment task) are designed to study the takeover behavior pattern in crash scenarios. Through driving simulation experiment, the number of takeover behavior patterns is eleven and the number of first takeover behaviors is three. Results showed that the first takeover behavior has a significant impact on the first takeover reaction time, speed, lateral offset, and minimum TTC, but the first takeover behavior has no significant effect on the takeover correct time. The takeover request lead time (TORlt) has a significant impact on the pattern and the first takeover behavior, while the non-driving-related task (NDRT) has no significant effect on the pattern and the first takeover behavior. In addition, this paper constructs a maps of takeover operation behavior, which more intuitively shows the behavior changes during a takeover.

AB This paper addresses the trajectory tracking problem of an autonomous tractor-trailer system by using a decentralized control approach. A fully decentralized model predictive controller is designed in which interactions between subsystems are neglected and assumed to be perturbations to each other. In order to have a robust design, a tube-based approach is proposed to handle the differences between the nominal model and real system. Nonlinear moving horizon estimation is used for the state and parameter estimation after each new measurement, and the estimated values are fed to robust tube-based decentralized nonlinearmodel predictive controller. The proposed control scheme is capable of driving the tractor-trailer system to any desired trajectory ensuring high control accuracy and robustness against neglected subsystem interactions and environmental disturbances. The experimental results show an accurate trajectory tracking performance on a bumpy grass field.

AB Freight transport is of major importance for the European economy and is growing thanks to increasing global trade. About three quarters of inland freight transport in the European Union is on roads. It has the potential to go through a dramatic change over the next decades thanks to the recent development of technologies such as wireless communication, cloud computing, sensor devices, and vehicle electronics. They enable a new integrated goods transport system based on optimized logistics, real-time traffic information, vehicular communications, collaborative driving, and autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we discuss challenges in creating a more efficient and sustainable goods road transportation system and how some of them can be tackled with a networked control approach. In particular, we discuss a method to improve the efficiency of the transportation system by minimizing the number of empty transports needed to fulfill the assignments on a given road network. Assignments with overlapping route segments might lead to further improvements, as the formation of vehicle platoons yields reduced fuel consumption. For realistic scenarios, it is shown that such collaboration opportunities arise already with relatively few vehicles. The fuel-efficient formation and control of platoons is also discussed. Some of the presented methods have been tested on real vehicles in traffic. The paper shows experimental results on automatic formation of vehicle platoons on a Swedish highway. The influence of traffic density on the merge maneuver is illustrated. The results indicate that platoon coordination could be improved by support from appropriate traffic monitoring technologies.

ID COOPERATIVE LOCALIZATION
AB The development of precise and robust navigation strategies for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) is fundamental to reach the high level of performance required by complex underwater tasks, often including more than one AUV. One of the main factors affecting the accuracy of AUVs navigation systems is the algorithm used to estimate the vehicle motion, usually based on kinematic vehicle models and linear estimators. A precise and reliable navigation system is indeed fundamental to AUVs: the Global Positioning System (GPS) signal is not available underwater, thus making it very hard to know the position of the vehicle in real-time. In this paper, the authors present an innovative navigation strategy specifically designed for AUVs, based on the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The new algorithm proves to be effective if applied to this class of vehicles and allows us to achieve a satisfying accuracy improvement compared to standard navigation algorithms. The proposed strategy has been experimentally validated using the navigation data acquired in suitable sea tests performed in Biograd Na Moru (Croatia) in the framework of the FP7 European ARROWS project tests performed during the Breaking the Surface 2014 (BtS 2014) workshop. The vehicles involved are the two Typhoon AUVs, developed and built by the Department of Industrial Engineering of the University of Florence within the THESAURUS Tuscany Region project for exploration and surveillance of underwater archaeological sites. The experiment, described in the paper, was performed to preliminary test the cooperative navigation between these AUVs. The new algorithm has been initially tested offline, and the validation of the proposed strategy provided accurate results in estimating the vehicle dynamic behaviour. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In recent years, road vehicle automation has become an important and popular topic for research and development in both academic and industrial spheres. New developments have received extensive coverage in the popular press, and it may be said that the topic has captured the public imagination. Indeed, the topic has generated interest across a wide range of academic, industry and governmental communities, well beyond vehicle engineering; these include computer science, transportation, urban planning, legal, social science and psychology. While this follows a similar surge of interest - and subsequent hiatus - of Automated Highway Systems in the 1990s, the current level of interest is substantially greater, and current expectations are high. It is common to frame the new technologies under the banner of 'self-driving cars' - robotic systems potentially taking over the entire role of the human driver, a capability that does not fully exist at present. However, this single vision leads one to ignore the existing range of automated systems that are both feasible and useful. Recent developments are underpinned by substantial and long-term trends in 'computerisation' of the automobile, with developments in sensors, actuators and control technologies to spur the new developments in both industry and academia. In this paper, we review the evolution of the intelligent vehicle and the supporting technologies with a focus on the progress and key challenges for vehicle system dynamics. A number of relevant themes around driving automation are explored in this article, with special focus on those most relevant to the underlying vehicle system dynamics. One conclusion is that increased precision is needed in sensing and controlling vehicle motions, a trend that can mimic that of the aerospace industry, and similarly benefit from increased use of redundant by-wire actuators.

AB Advanced driver assistances are becoming increasingly common in commercial cars, not only to assist but also to free drivers from manual driving whenever possible. Soon, drivers should be allowed to engage in non-driving-related tasks. The fact that responsibility for driving is shifting from humans to machines must be considered in the development of these assistances in order to guarantee safety and trust. In this article, we introduce AdVitam (for Advanced Driver-Vehicle Interaction to Make future driving safer), an autonomous system aiming at maintaining driver's situation awareness and optimizing takeover quality during conditionally automated driving. The information conveyed to drivers is dynamically adapted to achieve these goals, depending on the driving environment and the driver's physiological state. This system consists of three connected modules. The first module (Driver State) predicts the driver's state with machine learning and physiological signals as inputs. The second module (Supervision) uses different interfaces (a haptic seat, a personal device, and ambient lights) to maintain the drivers' situation awareness during the autonomous driving phases. The third module (Intervention) is a machine learning model that chooses the most appropriate combination among haptic, auditory, and visual modalities to request the driver to take over control and thus optimize takeover quality. To evaluate the system and each module independently, a preliminary user study with 35 drivers was conducted in a fixed-base driving simulator. All participants drove in two different environments (rural and urban). In addition, the activation of the Supervision and Intervention modules were manipulated as two between-subject factors. Results show that conveying information on the driving environment status through multimodal interfaces increases drivers' situation awareness (i.e., better identification of potential problems in the environment) and trust in the automated vehicle. However, the system does not show positive outcomes on takeover quality. Besides, the Driver State module provided consistent predictions with the experimental manipulation. The system proposed in this paper could lead to better acceptance and safety when conditionally automated vehicles will be released by increasing drivers' trust during phases of automated driving.

AB Underactuated autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) have stringent requirements on automatically tracking a predefined path. This paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC) approach based on adaptive line-of-sight (LOS) guidance for path following of ASVs. For the controller, a second-order nonlinear Nomoto model with disturbances is proposed as the vessel dynamic motion model after reviewing and comparing different ship motion models applied for path following control. For the guidance system, a novel adaptive LOS guidance with a variable acceptance circle radius is proposed to improve the precision of reference path tracking. Specifically, the acceptance circle radius is adapted with the angle between two adjacent straight segments of a reference path. Simulation experiments illustrate that the LOS guidance system with a variable acceptance circle radius results in smaller tracking errors compared with the fixed acceptance circle radius. The proposed path following method can track reference paths well even in the face of disturbances.

AB A Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) was developed for autonomous operation of a speed sprayer in an orchard. The operation of the FLC was graphically simulated under the real condition of the orchard. Machine vision was used to determine vehicle heading and four ultrasonic sensors were used to detect obstacles during the operation. Operation time duration of the hydraulic cylinders was inferred as output of the FLC. The results of simulation showed that the speed sprayer could be operated autonomously by the FLC that used sensor inputs from machine vision and ultrasonic sensors. After the graphic simulation, autonomous speed sprayer operation in a real orchard was conducted using the developed FLC. Orchard image analysis and signals of ultrasonic sensors were processed in real time. The speed sprayer was modified to be steered by two hydraulic cylinders. The results of field test showed that the speed sprayer could be operated by the FLC The ultrasonic sensors didn't contribute to the improvement of guidance performance; however they assisted the speed sprayer to avoid trees or obstacles in emergent situations.

AB The automotive domain has realized amazing advancements in communication, connectivity, and automation-and at a breakneck pace. Such advancements come with ample benefits, such as the reduction of traffic accidents and the refinement of transit efficiency. However, these new developments were not necessarily made with security in mind. Researchers have unearthed a number of security vulnerabilities in paradigms such as in-vehicle networks (IVNs), the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), and intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). As automotive technologies continue to evolve, it would be realistic to expect new vulnerabilities to arise-both vulnerabilities that are identified and vulnerabilities that are not. If-or more pragmatically, when-these vulnerabilities are exploited, intrusion detection will be paramount. Therefore, we find it prudent to review intrusion detection in the automotive domain. We explore a myriad of threats and intrusion detection techniques-from the boundaries of the vehicle's own network to the wider Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Intrusion detection, while not a panacea, can be a cost-effective solution to many automotive security issues. Generally, such intrusion detection systems (IDSs) do not disrupt existing hardware, infrastructure, or communications; rather, they merely tap into the network and monitor for suspicious traffic. Given the very reasonable price tag, the implementation of intrusion detection systems would be an auspicious step by the automotive industry to assure the security-and safety-of the modern automobile. This paper volunteers a comprehensive review of intrusion detection technologies in the automotive domain.

AB A modern vehicle has a complex internal architecture and is wirelessly connected to the Internet, other vehicles, and the infrastructure. The risk of cyber attacks and other criminal incidents along with recent road accidents caused by autonomous vehicles calls for more research on automotive digital forensics. Failures in automated driving functions can be caused by hardware and software failures and cyber security issues. Thus, it is imperative to be able to determine and investigate the cause of these failures, something which requires trustable data. However, automotive digital forensics is a relatively new field for the automotive where most existing self-monitoring and diagnostic systems in vehicles only monitor safety-related events. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first systematic literature review on the current research within this field. We identify and assess over 300 papers published between 2006-2021 and further map the relevant papers to different categories based on identified focus areas to give a comprehensive overview of the forensics field and the related research activities. Moreover, we identify forensically relevant data from the literature, link the data to categories, and further map them to required security properties and potential stakeholders. Our categorization makes it easy for practitioners and researchers to quickly find relevant work within a particular sub-field of digital forensics. We believe our contributions can guide digital forensic investigations in automotive and similar areas, such as cyber-physical systems and smart cities, facilitate further research, and serve as a guideline for engineers implementing forensics mechanisms.

AB In order to decrease computation loads for path following control of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs), in this article, we aim to design an output-feedback path following controller by using a learning-based least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) model. The signal transmission delay, which would deteriorates the control performance, is considered as well. First, the LS-SVM model for vehicle path following system is trained. Then, the output-feedback controller subject to stochastic communication delay, which meets the stability condition, is designed for the LS-SVM model. The modeling error and bias terms of LS-SVM model are regarded as the disturbance term. In order to attenuate the effect of disturbance, H-infinity controller is designed for the AGVs to track the target path. Grey wolf optimizer is employed to solve the controller design problem with H-infinity performance and transform stability condition from bilinear matrix inequality to linear matrix inequality (LMI). Then, we employ efficient LMI toolbox to solve the LMI. To guarantee the effectiveness of proposed controller, characteristics of steering wheel in a hardware-in-loop platform are studied and rate of steering angle is regarded as the actuator constraints for designing controller. Experimental results based on the hardware-in-loop platform have verified the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

ID RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
AB In complex traffic environment scenarios, it is very important for autonomous vehicles to accurately perceive the dynamic information of other vehicles around the vehicle in advance. The accuracy of 3D object detection will be affected by problems such as illumination changes, object occlusion, and object detection distance. To this purpose, we face these challenges by proposing a multimodal feature fusion network for 3D object detection (MFF-Net). In this research, this paper first uses the spatial transformation projection algorithm to map the image features into the feature space, so that the image features are in the same spatial dimension when fused with the point cloud features. Then, feature channel weighting is performed using an adaptive expression augmentation fusion network to enhance important network features, suppress useless features, and increase the directionality of the network to features. Finally, this paper increases the probability of false detection and missed detection in the non-maximum suppression algo-rithm by increasing the one-dimensional threshold.

TI Deep Learning-Based GNSS Network-Based Real-Time Kinematic Improvement
   for Autonomous Ground Vehicle Navigation
SO JOURNAL OF SENSORS

DT Article
AB Much navigation over the last several decades has been aided by the global navigation satellite system (GNSS). In addition, with the advent of the multi-GNSS era, more and more satellites are available for navigation purposes. However, the navigation is generally carried out by point positioning based on the pseudoranges. The real-time kinematic (RTK) and the advanced technology, namely, the network RTK (NRTK), were introduced for better positioning and navigation. Further improved navigation was also investigated by combining other sensors such as the inertial measurement unit (IMU). On the other hand, a deep learning technique has been recently evolving in many fields, including automatic navigation of the vehicles. This is because deep learning combines various sensors without complicated analytical modeling of each individual sensor. In this study, we structured the multilayer recurrent neural networks (RNN) to improve the accuracy and the stability of the GNSS absolute solutions for the autonomous vehicle navigation. Specifically, the long short-term memory (LSTM) is an especially useful algorithm for time series data such as navigation with moderate speed of platforms. From an experiment conducted in a testing area, the LSTM algorithm developed the positioning accuracy by about 40% compared to GNSS-only navigation without any external bias information. Once the bias is taken care of, the accuracy will significantly be improved up to 8 times better than the GNSS absolute positioning results. The bias terms of the solution need to be estimated within the model by optimizing the layers as well as the nodes each layer, which should be done in further research.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have demonstrated superior performance for tracking marine animals tagged with individually coded acoustic transmitters. However, AUVs engaged in mapping the distribution of multiple tagged fish have not previously been able to alter search paths to achieve precise position estimates. This problem is solved by the development of payload control software (Synthetic Aperture Override, SAOVR) that allows the AUV to maneuver with trajectories favorable for solving the tag's location from a synthetic aperture. Upon tag detection during a default mission search path, SAOVR (running on an embedded guest computer) seeks permission to take over navigation from the vehicle's native system after checking constraints of geography, timing, tag identification, signal strength, and current navigation state. Permitted maneuvers are then chosen from a template library and executed before returning the AUV to the point of first deviation for continued searching of other tags. Field evaluation on moored reference tags showed a high level of predictability in the AUV's behavior at SAOVR initiation and through maneuvers. Trials suggest that this logic system is highly beneficial to AUV use for fish telemetry in challenging environments such as narrow, deep fjords, or among reefs. Any mission programmed with the AUV's native software can be run with the SAOVR package to allow scientists to easily implement and manipulate synthetic aperture geometries without altering any of the software. Further modeling can help improve template design specific to expected movements of different fish species and relative to the designation of signal strength-defined execution thresholds.

AB The intelligent transportation system (ITS) is one of the key components of future transportation. Vehicle trajectory prediction, which is made possible by recent advancement in sensor and communication technology, can help ITS to improve efficiency and safety of transportation by detecting potential conflicts and accidents. However, prior works mainly focus on trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles in small-scale scenarios. In addition, interpretability of trajectory prediction, which facilitates trustworthiness of ITS, has received scant attention in the research literature. This study proposes intention-aware interactive transformer (IIT) model to address the problem of real-time vehicle trajectory prediction in large-scale dense traffic scenarios. IIT follows the transformer architecture to process time-series data and adopts an intention-based scheme to predict future trajectories. Unlike prior works that use complicated data structure to represent the spatial relation between vehicles, what is unique about IIT is that the interactions between vehicles are captured using a multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism. Moreover, the interpretability of IIT is illustrated in two levels: inter-vehicle attention and intra-vehicle intention. Experimental results suggest that MHA significantly reduces the computational cost of data preprocessing for IIT. Consequently, IIT runs up to eight times faster than baseline models in large-scale dense traffic scenarios while only suffering an average of 7.6% accuracy degradation in a 5-s prediction horizon. Further, interpretability analysis is conducted, which reveals that the interpretability of IIT is beneficial to ITS in many ways, such as detecting potential congestion and solving driver conflicts.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted communications have been regarded as a promising technology, which can be used in dynamic heterogeneous networks, since the UAVs can be applied as mobile base stations (MBSs). It is more efficient to set the UAVs as MBSs in different layers according to their functions. Due to the ability in communicating with other vehicles or facilities, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) makes the information required by the vehicles be efficiently transmitted and processed, so as to increase the safety of driving. However, because of the rapid change of topology and the huge demand of data transmission, it is hard to guarantee the efficient coverage of all the vehicles only by the support of terrestrial wireless communication networks. Considering this, this study combines UAV and V2X communications together, and proposes a multi-layer aerial-road vehicular (MLARV) architecture. The UAVs in the higher layer are in charge of overall monitoring, while the UAVs in the lower layer are responsible for hot-spot area coverage. To solve the throughput maximisation problem, the authors further propose a density-aware deployment (DAD) scheme with an iterative three-dimensional matching resource allocation algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed DAD scheme with the MLARV architecture outperforms the traditional UAV-assisted V2X communications with single layer architecture.

AB Secure localization of vehicles is gaining the attention of researchers from both academia and industry especially due to the emergence of internet of things (IoT). The modern vehicles are usually equipped with circuitries that gives connectivity with other vehicles and with cellular networks such as 4G/Fifth generation cellar network (5G). The challenge of secure localization and positioning is magnified further with the invention of technologies such as autonomous or driverless vehicles based on IoT, satellite, and 5G. Some satellite and IoT based localization techniques exploit machine learning, semantic segmentation, and access control mechanism. Access control provides access grant and secure information sharing mechanism to authorized users and restricts unauthorized users, which is necessary regarding security and privacy of government or military vehicles. Previously, static conflict of interest (COI) based access control was used for security proposes. However, static COI based access control creates excesses and administrative overload that creates latency in execution, which is the least tolerable factor in modern IoT or 5G control vehicles. Therefore, in this paper, a hybrid access control (HAC) model is proposed that implements the dynamic COI in the HAC model on the level of roles. The proposed model is enhanced by modifying the role-based access control (RBAC) model by inserting new attributes of the RBAC entities. The HAC model deals with COI on the level of roles in an efficient manner as compared to previously proposed models. Moreover, this model features significant improvement in terms of dynamic behavior, decreased administrative load, and security especially for vehicular localization. Furthermore, the mathematical modeling of the proposed model is implemented with an example scenario to validate the concept.

AB In this paper, we present work on the control of autonomous vehicle formations in the context of the coordinated standoff tracking problem. The objective is to use a team of unmanned aircraft to fly a circular orbit around a moving target with prescribed intervehicle angular spacing using only local information. We use the recently introduced Lyapunov guidance vector field approach to achieve the desired circular trajectory. The contributions of this paper involve both single-vehicle. path planning and multiple-vehicle coordination. For single-vehicle path planning, we complete a proof of heading convergence using feedback, which has thus far not been fully addressed in the literature. We also offer a novel approach for heading convergence that does not require continuous feedback in the ideal case (no wind, stationary target), taking advantage of an analytical solution for the guidance field. Further, we use a variable airspeed controller to maintain the circular trajectory despite unknown wind and unknown constant velocity target motion. Adaptive estimates of the unknown wind and target motion are introduced to ensure stability of the circular trajectory. A novel feature of our results is rigorous satisfaction of vehicle-specific kinematic constraints on heading rates and airspeed variations. For multiple-vehicle coordination, we again use a variable airspeed controller to achieve the prescribed angular spacing. We make a connection with some recent work that addresses information architecture in vehicle formations using rigid graph theory. Specifically, we discuss two types of information architectures, symmetric and asymmetric, and implement decentralized control laws that are based on these architectures. The information architectures are scalable in that the number of required communication/sensing links increases linearly with the number of vehicles. The control laws are decentralized in that they use only local information.

AB Visual servoing can greatly improve underwater robot manipulation accuracy and automation. Its main purpose is to control the end-effector pose of underwater vehicle manipulator systems (UVMS) relative to the target by using features extracted from image. However, underwater manipulation visual servoing suffers from the drawback of perception limitation of visibility range, obscure and low contrast image, inaccurate camera cali-bration and model parameters. This article has reviewed the state of major visual servoing method on UVMS including position based visual servoing (PBVS) and image based visual servoing (IBVS). On the problem of underwater manipulation and vision control, a novel hybrid strategy of visual servoing control based on un-calibrated visual servoing has been issued. Simulations and comparisons on PBVS, IBVS and proposed hybrid strategy have been made. The article is concluded with challenge analysis and future research trends discussions.

AB This paper proposes a fuzzy modeling and event-triggered adaptive sliding mode control for steer-by-wire (SbW) systems subject to uncertain nonlinearity, time-varying perturbation, actuator fault, and limited communication resources. First, an interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2 FLS) based on Lyapunov's adaptive scheme is built to model the uncertain nonlinearity. Then, an event-triggered adaptive sliding mode control method is designed to overcome the limited communication resources, time-varying perturbation, and actuator fault. This method eliminates the chattering phenomenon by utilizing nested adaptive technology and has practical finite-time stability. Theoretical analysis shows that the Zeno phenomenon is excluded. Finally, the validity of the methods is evaluated using simulations and vehicle experiments.

TI Heterogeneous Driver Modeling and Corner Scenarios Sampling for
   Automated Vehicles Testing
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
ID BEHAVIOR
AB Virtual simulation-based testing of autonomous vehicles (AVs) needs massive challenging corner cases to reach high testing accuracy. Current methods achieve this goal by finding testing scenarios with low sampling frequency in the empirical distribution. However, these methods neglect modeling heterogeneous driving behavior, which actually is crucial for finding corner cases. To fill this gap, we propose an interpretable and operable method for sampling corner cases. Firstly, we initialize a testing scenario and allocate testing tasks to AV. Then, to simulate the variability in driving behaviors, we design utility functions with several hyperparameters and generate aggressive, conservative, and normal driving strategies by adjusting hyperparameters. By changing the heterogeneous driving behavior of surrounding vehicles (SVs), we can sample the challenging corner cases in the scenario. Finally, we conduct a series of simulation experiments in a typical lane-changing scenario. The simulation results reveal that by adjusting the occurrence frequency of heterogeneous SVs in the testing scenario, more corner cases can be found in limited rounds of simulations.

AB Human error has been implicated as a causal factor in a large proportion of road accidents. Automated driving systems purport to mitigate this risk, but self-driving systems that allow a driver to entirely disengage from the driving task also require the driver to monitor the environment and take control when necessary. Given that sleep loss impairs monitoring performance and there is a high prevalence of sleep deficiency in modern society, we hypothesized that supervising a self-driving vehicle would unmask latent sleepiness compared to manually controlled driving among individuals following their typical sleep schedules. We found that participants felt sleepier, had more involuntary transitions to sleep, had slower reaction times and more attentional failures, and showed substantial modifications in brain synchronization during and following an autonomous drive compared to a manually controlled drive. Our findings suggest that the introduction of partial self-driving capabilities in vehicles has the potential to paradoxically increase accident risk.

DE rendezvous; multivehicle; mine countermeasures
AB Advantages of using a multivehicle network over a single autonomous under- water vehicle platform include extended coverage area, potential cost and, time efficiency, and more robust performance. A common issue hat slows advancement in the field is the limited available communication between the platforms. The approach we propose is based on assigning a sequence rendezvous points (RPs) where the vehicles can meet and exchange information. The work we present in this paper applies princiipally to mine countermeasure and suggests that despite the disadvantage of time to allow for the vehicles to reach the RPs, there are techniques that can minimize the losses and provide advantage such as easier coordination and access points for operator monitoring and system modifications. The results we present in this paper give an estimate of the reduction in loss if such an approach is employed, We make a comparison between the RP and a benchmark case by analyzing numerical simulations.

AB This paper describes a recently proposed algorithm in mapping the unknown obstacle in a stationary environment where the obstacles are represented as curved in nature. The focus is to achieve a guaranteed performance of sensor-based navigation and mapping. The guaranteed performance is quantified by explicit bounds of the position estimate of an autonomous aerial vehicle using an extended Kalman filter to track the obstacle and extract its map. The Dubins path planning algorithm is used to provide a flyable and safe path to the vehicle to fly from one location to another. The 2-D Splinegon technique is presented for the mapping of the unknown complex obstacles. This Splinegon technique, which is the most efficient and a robust way to estimate the boundary of a curved-nature obstacles, can provide mathematically provable performance guarantees that are achievable in practice.

AB Intersections are prone to congestion in urban areas and making competent speed plans for vehicles to efficiently utilize green time resources is significant for congestion alleviation and driving experience improvement. The key is to increase the chance of going through green lights and avoid idling at red lights. Existing works for velocity planning fail to fully consider various realistic traffic conditions, such as interfering traffic, free lane switch, and group efficiency, thus compromising effectiveness and limiting feasibility. To address all the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel method DeepGAL for vehicle control by dividing vehicles into groups, assigning a leader in each group and delivering intelligent control on leaders with deep reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments are conducted based on two real-world datasets with distinct traffic flow rates in Hangzhou, China, and the results demonstrate that DeepGAL achieves outstanding improvement over various performance metrics applied in five classic car following models considering realistic traffic conditions. Moreover, DeepGAL outperforms four state-of-the-art baseline methods over various metrics under both light and heavy real-world traffic flows. The test of DeepGAL with indeterministic traffic-signal phase and timing (SPAT) information under an adaptive traffic signal control indicates its effectiveness even with partial SPAT information. In addition, considering the practical issue that only some of the vehicles can be controlled by our scheme, we conduct simulations on different penetration levels of controlled leader vehicles, which demonstrate that even with only 10% penetration, DeepGAL can notably alleviate congestion and enhance driving experience at intersections, validating its great feasibility.

AB The development of autonomous vehicles brings new challenges for vehicle electronics as well as in-vehicle network (IVN) design. Functional safety is the uttermost requirement of future vehicles, which requires an exchange of a copious amount of safety-critical data through the in-vehicle network (IVN). To meet the high-reliability requirements of future vehicle applications in IVN, IEEE time-sensitive networking (TSN) proposes an active redundancy-based fault-tolerant mechanism called frame replication and elimination for reliability (FRER) in IEEE 802.1CB standard. In FRER, safety-critical data is transmitted via multiple disjoint paths between source and destination. In case one path fails, the safety-critical data can still be delivered to the destination via another path. The main drawback of FRER is that it is over-utilizing the available bandwidth of the network, which in turn reduces the number of schedulable flows. In this paper, the XOR network coding (XNC) technique is proposed as a new efficient spatial redundancy-based fault-tolerant mechanism for IVN. This work considered the strict time-scheduled transmissions for XNC and FRER. In this regard, three different dynamic scheduling and routing heuristics are developed and integrated with XNC techniques to increase the number of schedulable flows without degrading the reliability of the network. The experi-mental results show the efficacy of the XNC-Bottleneck heuristic which schedules almost 8.5% more flows in fix-time scheduling of the disjoint paths and 20% more flows in variable-time scheduling of the disjoint paths as compared to the FRER-Bottleneck heuristic.

AB Millimetre Wave integrated Massive Multiple Input and Multiple Output (mmWave-Massive MIMO) technology is an exciting area of research to enable Vehicle to Vehicle Communication (VTVCom) in a variety of fields. The combination of mmWave-Massive MIMO technology supports a wide range of applications, from 5G networks to autonomous vehicles. Based on this context, each VTV User communication Link (VUL) is expected to enable high-capacity and reliable communication between vehicles in a dense urban environment over rapidly time varying channels. However, the vehicular channel is degraded due to the presence of other vehicles in the vicinity of each VUL. This interference can cause tracking algorithms to fail or become less effective, which can lead to degraded VTV link quality and communication errors. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a deep learning based Direction Of Signal (DOS) tracking inspired channel estimation model using Deep NestedLayered Long Short-Term Memory network (DN-LrLSTM) for VTVCominmmWave-Massive MIMO systems. In this, we employed a DN-LrLSTM model to acquire the state channel features of VUL, and to update various channel parameters by capturing DOS tracking features over varying channels.The DOS tracking based channel estimation model solves the vehicle degradation problems and accurately estimates various channel parameters. Experimental results are conducted on an urban road VTV communication scenario, which shows the performance of the proposed DN-LrLSTM framework achieves high capability in capturing complicated channel features of VUL and outperforms robust performance on accurate channel estimation in terms of several evaluation metrics.

AB This article addresses the design of a fully automated photovoltaic (PV) power plant inspection process by a fleet of unmanned aerial and ground vehicles (UAVs/UGVs). More specifically, we consider the problem of assigning a set of target points to be inspected to a fleet of UAVs/UGVs so as to minimize the overall energy consumption while accounting for the battery degradation and the vehicle deterioration. In order to cope with the combinatorial complexity of the problem, we propose a suboptimal resolution strategy that integrates a graph-theoretic approach for local path planning at the robot level into a market-based approach for task assignment at the fleet level. The resulting coordination scheme is scalable and plug and play, and requires a minimal amount of information exchange between the robots and a central auctioneer, thus allowing the interoperability of different robotic platforms. Extensive numerical analysis via a multiagent simulation software shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB The modeling of driver behavior plays an essential role in developing Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) to support the driver in various complex driving scenarios. The behavior estimation of surrounding vehicles is crucial for an autonomous vehicle to safely navigate through an unsignalized intersection. This work proposes a novel kernelized convolutional transformer network (KCTN) with multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism to estimate driver behavior at a challenging unsignalized three-way roundabout. More emphasis has been placed on creating convolution in non-linear space by introducing a kervolution operation into the proposed network. It generalizes convolution, improves model capacity, and captures higher-order feature interactions by using Gaussian kernel function. The proposed model is validated using the real-world ACFR dataset, where it outperforms current state-of-the-art in terms of behavior prediction accuracy and provides a significant lead time before potential conflict situations.(c) 2022 ISA.

AB This article presents an initial appraisal of the emerging Australian approach to applying privacy and data protection laws to automated technologies. These laws and the general context in which they operate will be explained, with appropriate comparisons made to the European Union frameworks. In order to examine their specific application vis-a-vis automated technologies, three case studies - automated facial recognition technologies (AFRT), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs - better known as 'drones') and autonomous vehicles (or 'driverless cars') - are selected to examine the extent to which existing privacy and data protection laws, and their application, can be considered adequate to address privacy and data protection risks that these technologies bring. These case studies evidence existing deficiencies with privacy protection in Australia and the inadequacy of recent reform processes, demonstrating that Australian data privacy laws are not well placed to protect individuals' rights vis-a-vis automated technologies.

AB This paper investigates the performance of an intelligent reflective surface (IRS) assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, where the IRS is mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to assist the transmissions from a base station (BS). The BS utilizes the UAV as a relay to serve multiple user equipments (UEs) on the ground. In addition to the IRS relaying links, we also incorporate direct non line-of-sight links between the BS and UEs. We derive the outage probability for this system configuration. Moreover, we obtain a bound of the ergodic spectral efficiency to extract various useful insights. Furthermore, we also compare the performance of the proposed system design against the baseline scheme. Finally, we present numerical results to highlight the benefits of the proposed IRS-aided UAV relaying system and the accuracy of the derived analytical results.

DT Article
AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used in different military missions. In this paper, we focus on the autonomous mission allocation and planning abilities for the UAV systems. Such abilities enable adaptation to more complex and dynamic mission environments. We first examine the mission planning of a single unmanned aerial vehicle. Based on that, we then investigate the multi-UAV cooperative system under the mission background of cooperative target destruction and show that it is a many-to-one rendezvous problem. A heterogeneous UAV cooperative mission planning model is then proposed where the mission background is generated based on the Voronoi diagram. We then adopt the tabu genetic algorithm (TGA) to obtain multi-UAV mission planning. The simulation results show that the single-UAV and multi-UAV mission planning can be effectively realized by the Voronoi diagram-TGA (V-TGA). It is also shown that the proposed algorithm improves the performance by 3% in comparison with the Voronoi diagram-particle swarm optimization (V-PSO) algorithm.

ID AUTONOMOUS AIR COMBAT
AB In view of the high dynamic, uncertain and time-varying characteristics of unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) air combat situation, a maneuver decision method based on fuzzy reasoning is proposed. Firstly, four advantage factors of angle, distance, speed, and height are established from the air combat scene. Secondly, the fuzzy rules are used to evaluate the air combat situation. The advantage factors representing the air combat situation are input into the fuzzy reasoning machine to adaptively adjust the weight of each factor in the advantage function. As an auxiliary means of maneuver decision-making, the enemy aircraft position prediction model integrating decision-maneuver, sequence-maneuver, and inertial-maneuver is proposed. Finally, simulation results show that the fuzzy reasoning method could guide UCAV to make more targeted maneuver decisions according to the real-time combat situation. The fuzzy reasoning method provides a new solution on improving the UCAV self-decision ability.

AB The question of how to estimate the state of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in real time in multi-environments remains a challenge. Although the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) has been widely applied, drones cannot perform position estimation when a GNSS signal is not available or the GNSS is disturbed. In this paper, the problem of state estimation in multi-environments is solved by employing an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm to fuse the data from multiple heterogeneous sensors (MHS), including an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a magnetometer, a barometer, a GNSS receiver, an optical flow sensor (OFS), Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and an RGB-D camera. Finally, the robustness and effectiveness of the multi-sensor data fusion system based on the EKF algorithm are verified by field flights in unstructured, indoor, outdoor, and indoor and outdoor transition scenarios.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Charging coordination of large-population autonomous plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in the power grid can be formulated as a class of constrained optimization problems. To overcome the computational complexity, a game-based method is proposed for the charging problems of the PEV population, which is composed of homogeneous subpopulations, such that individuals update their best charging strategies simultaneously with respect to a common electricity price determined by the total demand. To mitigate the oscillation behavior caused by the greedy behavior for the cheap electricity by individuals, a deviation cost is introduced to penalize against the deviation of the individual strategy from the average value of the homogeneous subpopulation. By adopting a proper deviation cost and following a best strategy update mechanism, the game systems may converge to the socially optimal valley-fill Nash equilibrium. Simulation examples are studied to illustrate the results.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been attracting a lot of interest for their significant advantages in terms of mobility and cost. Herein, we address a learning-based channel access method for UAV networks, which is named learning backoff algorithm. The proposed algorithm allows UAVs to determine the adequate backoff time without any information exchanges in distributed network environments. Each UAV in the network learns the network characteristics by analyzing its own location information and the pattern of the network obtained from the received signals. By employing the reinforcement learning (RL) model, UAVs learn repetitive flight patterns and select a proper backoff time to ensure link stability while avoiding collisions. The RL model utilizes a deep learning model and replay memory to handle the large amount of state-action data generated in UAV networks. The proposed algorithm shows promising results as a solution to the channel access problem in UAV networks.

AB This article investigates an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless-powered mobile-edge computing (MEC) system, where the UAV powers the mobile terminals by wireless power transfer (WPT) and provides computation service for them. We aim to maximize the computation bits of terminals while ensuring fairness among them. Considering the random trajectories of mobile terminals, we propose a soft actor-critic (SAC)-based UAV trajectory planning and resource allocation (SAC-TR) algorithm, which combines off-policy and maximum entropy reinforcement learning to improve the convergence of the algorithm. We design the reward as a heterogeneous function of computation bits, fairness, and destination. Simulation results show that SAC-TR can quickly adapt to varying network environments and outperform representative benchmarks in various situations.

AB Although the level of safety required before drivers will accept self-driving cars is not dear, the criterion of being safer than a human driver has become pervasive in the discourse on vehicle automation. This criterion actually means "safer than the average human driver," because it is necessarily defined with respect to population-level data. At the level of individual risk assessment a body of research has shown that most drivers perceive themselves to be safer than the average driver (the better-than-average effect). Method: Using an online sample, this study examined U.S. drivers' ratings of their own ability to drive safely and their desired level of safety for self driving vehicles. Results: This study replicated the better-than average effect and showed that most drivers stated a desire for self-driving cars that are safer than their own perceived ability to drive safely before they would: (1) feel reasonably safe riding in a self-driving vehicle; (2) buy a self-driving vehicle, all other things (cost, etc.) being equal; and (3) allow self-driving vehicles on public roads. Conclusions: Since most drivers believe they are better than average drivers, the benchmark of achieving automation that is safer than a human driver (on average) may not represent acceptably safe performance of self-driving cars for most drivers. Practical applications: If perceived level of safety is an important contributor to acceptance of self-driving vehicles, the popular "safer than a human driver" benchmark may not be adequate for widespread acceptance.

AB Recent literature shows that automated vehicle (AV) significantly impacts traffic flow stability. However, as a widely used longitudinal AV technology, the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system still has several unknown features that lack field data for modeling. We ran a series of novel tests with two ACC vehicles to simulate the behavior of the AV platoon in the field experiment. We designed a linear car-following controller in the upper layer system and tested the string stability of the ACC vehicle platoon. Data is collected through the vehicle's GPS sensor and upper controller. These data can help us estimate the feedback delay in the upper layer and parasitic lag in the lower layer. The data analysis results specify the range of different time delays and further optimize the dynamic response model in the lower layer. Then we propose an improved longi-tudinal model based on a first-order inertia system with a pure time delay in the dynamic response process. The experimental results show that the improved longitudinal model is twenty percent more accurate than the traditional first-order inertia model. Finally, we analyze the string stability of the improved longitudinal model. The results indicate that the improved longitudinal model has more strict stability conditions than the traditional model. Although the current feedback delay can satisfy the string stability criterion, the parasitic lag in the dynamics response process cannot satisfy the stability criterion. In this study, a customized ACC car-following controller is implemented in the field experiments, and thus all hypotheses and analysis results are validated by field data.

AB Surrogate Safety Measures (SSM) are important for safety performance evaluation, since crashes are rare events and historical crash data does not capture near crashes that are also critical for improving safety. This paper focuses on SSM and their applications, particularly in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV) safety modeling. It aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of significant SSM studies, identify limitations and opportunities for future SSM and CAV research, and assist researchers and practitioners with choosing the most appropriate SSM for safety studies. The behaviors of CAV can be very different from those of Human-Driven Vehicles (HDV). Even among CAV with different automation/connectivity levels, their behaviors are likely to differ. Also, the behaviors of HDV can change in response to the existence of CAV in mixed autonomy traffic. Simulation by far is the most viable solution to model CAV safety. However, it is questionable whether conventional SSM can be applied to modeling CAV safety based on simulation results due to the lack of sophisticated simulation tools that can accurately model CAV behaviors and SSM that can take CAV's powerful sensing and path prediction and planning capabilities into crash risk modeling, although some researchers suggested that proper simulation model calibration can be helpful to address these issues. A number of critical questions related to SSM for CAV safety research are also identified and discussed, including SSM for CAV trajectory optimization, SSM for individual vehicles and vehicle platoon, and CAV as a new data source for developing SSM.

AB While partially automated vehicles can provide a range of benefits, they also bring about new Human Machine Interface (HMI) challenges around ensuring the driver remains alert and is able to take control of the vehicle when required. While humans are poor monitors of automated processes, specifically during & x2018;steady state & x2019; operation, presenting the appropriate information to the driver can help. But to date, interfaces of partially automated vehicles have shown evidence of causing cognitive overload. Adaptive HMIs that automatically change the information presented (for example, based on workload, time or physiologically), have been previously proposed as a solution, but little is known about how information should adapt during steady-state driving. This study aimed to classify information usage based on driver experience to inform the design of a future adaptive HMI in partially automated vehicles. The unique feature of this study over existing literature is that each participant attended for five consecutive days; enabling a first look at how information usage changes with increasing familiarity and providing a methodological contribution to future HMI user trial study design. Seventeen participants experienced a steady-state automated driving simulation for twenty-six minutes per day in a driving simulator, replicating a regularly driven route, such as a work commute. Nine information icons, representative of future partially automated vehicle HMIs, were displayed on a tablet and eye tracking was used to record the information that the participants fixated on. The results found that information usage did change with increased exposure, with significant differences in what information participants looked at between the first and last trial days. With increasing experience, participants tended to view information as confirming technical competence rather than the future state of the vehicle. On this basis, interface design recommendations are made, particularly around the design of adaptive interfaces for future partially automated vehicles.

AB This paper studies the optimal planning of public transit services with modular vehicles. In the modular service operation, the vehicle is comprised of smaller modular units/pods, which can be assembled/dissembled at some specially designed transit stations. The planning decisions are to determine the locations of the specially constructed stations enabling station-wise assembling/dissembling of modular units. Meanwhile, the capacity of these stations, i.e., the maximum number of modular units that can be accommodated, will also be determined. The optimal vehicle formation at these stations will be considered for the multi-period passenger demand to evaluate the system performance. Aiming to minimize the total cost of the operator and passengers, we formulate this problem into a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). Two solution methods are proposed to solve the problem. One is to transform the formulated MINLP into a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) using various linearization reformulation techniques, which can be solved by using many existing solution methods for MILP. Despite that this method ensures exact solutions, its solution efficiency is compromised. To solve a practical large-size problem, we propose another solution method applying surrogate model-based optimization approaches. A case study in the context of a proposed Singapore dynamic autonomous road transit (DART) line is conducted. Numerical experiments have been carried out to test the validity of the model formulation and the solution performance of the proposed solution methods. The advantage of the modular-vehicle transit service in significantly reducing the operating cost and passengers' travel time costs has been demonstrated as well. This study offers the public transportation planners a useful tool for determining optimal operation strategies for the future transit service system with modular vehicles.

AB The mutual understanding between driver and vehicle is critical to the realization of intelligent vehicles and customized interaction interface. In this study, a unified driver behavior modeling system toward multi-scale behavior recognition is proposed to enhance the driver behavior reasoning ability for intelligent vehicles. Specifically, the driver behavior recognition system is designed to simultaneously recognize the driver's physical and mental states based on a deep encoder-decoder framework. The model jointly learns to recognize three driver behaviors with different time scales: mirror checking and facial expression state, and two mental behaviors, including intention and emotion. The encoder module is designed based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture spatial information from the input video stream. Then, several decoders for different driver states estimation are proposed with fully-connected (FC) and long short-term memory (LSTM) based recurrent neural networks (RNN). Two naturalistic datasets are used in this study to investigate the model performance, which is a local highway dataset, namely, CranData, and one public dataset from Brain4Cars. Based on the spatial-temporal representation of driver physical behavior, it shows that the observed physical behaviors can be used to model the latent mental behaviors through the proposed end-to-end learning process. The testing results on these two datasets show state-of-the-art results on mirror checking behavior, intention, and emotion recognition. With the proposed system, intelligent vehicles can gain a holistic understanding of the driver's physical and phycological behaviors to better collaborate and interact with the human driver, and the driver behavior reasoning system helps to reduce the conflicts between the human and vehicle automation.

AB While many works exploiting an existing Lie group structure have been proposed for state estimation, in particular the invariant extended Kalman filter (IEKF), few papers address the construction of a group structure that allows casting a given system into the framework of invariant filtering. In this article, we introduce a large class of systems encompassing most problems involving a navigating vehicle encountered in practice. For those systems we introduce a novel methodology that systematically provides a group structure for the state space, including vectors of the body frame such as biases. We use it to derive observers having properties akin to those of linear observers or filters. The proposed unifying and versatile framework encompasses all systems, where IEKF has proved successful, improves state-of-the art "imperfect" IEKF for inertial navigation with sensor biases, and allows addressing novel examples, like GNSS antenna lever arm estimation.

AB Tree crown detection plays a vital role in forestry management, resource statistics, and yield forecasting. Red, green and blue (RGB) high-resolution aerial images have emerged as a cost-effective source of data for tree crown detection. To address the challenges in the detection using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) optical images, we propose a one-stage object detection network, tree crown detection network (TCDNet). First, the network provides an attention enhancement feature extraction module to enable the model to distinguish between tree crowns and their complex backgrounds. Second, an efficient loss is introduced to enable it to be aware of the overlap between adjacent trees, thus effectively avoiding misdetection. The experimental results on two publicly available datasets show that the proposed network outperforms state-of-art networks in terms of precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP).

AB The second-generation reusable launch vehicle will incorporate sophisticated new guidance and control methods to increase the system's flexibility, in particular making it a practical vehicle for unmanned cargo missions. This project focuses on trajectory design and guidance for the terminal area energy management phase of flight, where traditional methods have produced limited results. Fuzzy logic methods are used to make onboard autonomous gliding return trajectory design robust to the possibility of control surface failures, thus, increasing the flexibility of unmanned gliding recovery and landing. Fuzzy inference systems are used to design the trajectory and provide guidance commands for the vehicle bank angle and negative z axis acceleration. Fuzzy logic provides a practical means of incorporating conflicting objectives and constraints in choosing trajectory parameters. The method has the flexibility to choose these parameters from a continuum of possible values. The design is validated using a high-fidelity six-degree-of-freedom simulation of the X-33 technology demonstrator.

AB A number of autonomous underwater vehicles, AUV, are equipped with commercial ducted propellers, most of them produced originally for the remote operated vehicle, ROV, industry. However, AUVs and ROVs are supposed to work quite differently since the ROV operates in almost the bollard pull condition, while the AUV works at larger cruising speeds. Moreover, they can have an influence in the maneuverability of AUV due to the lift the duct generates in the most distant place of the vehicle's center of mass. In this work, it is proposed the modeling of the hydrodynamic forces and moment on a duct propeller according to a numerical (CFD) simulation, and analytical and semi-empirical, ASE, approaches. Predicted values are compared to experimental results produced in a towing tank. Results confirm the advantages of the symbiosis between CFD and ASE methods for modeling the influence of the propeller duct in the AUV maneuverability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB ObjectiveVehicle active safety systems can improve vehicle security by avoiding collisions. An autonomous emergency braking (AEB) system's safety distance calculation is usually based on normal weather conditions. The AEB system's early warning capabilities decrease during adverse weather conditions.MethodsA multilayer perceptron (MLP) model is used to obtain data from accident and weather data sets. The MLP model is trained and the severity of accidents is predicted. The severity is used as a parameter to build an adaptive AEB system algorithm that considers adverse weather conditions.ResultsThe adaptive AEB system algorithm increases safety and reliability under adverse weather conditions. Prescan and a driver-in-the-loop system are used to test the adaptive AEB model. Both tests show that the adaptive AEB model has better performance under adverse weather than the traditional AEB model.ConclusionsThe experimental results demonstrate that the adaptive AEB system can increase the safety distance in rainy weather and avoid collisions under hazy conditions.

AB This paper solves the trajectory tracking problem for underactuated autonomous surface vessels in the presence of uncertainty dynamics and unavailable velocities. A robust controller is proposed by employing a neural network, command filtered backstepping method, and adaptive control method. Moreover, all tracking errors are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded on the basis of the Lyapunov Theorem. The findings of the study are summarized as follows: (i) The uncertainty dynamics of the control system are estimated and approximated by the neural network and state predictors, which allows the designed controller to be easily applied in practice. (ii) To accurately acquire the velocities of the control system, a neuro-adaptive observer is proposed to obtain the unavailable velocities. (iii) A filtered compensation loop is built to decrease filtered signal error, which is caused by the second-order filter. Finally, simulations are performed to verify the robustness and effective tracking performance of the proposed control scheme in consideration of external disturbances.

AB Nowadays, autonomous vehicles have achieved a lot of research interest regarding the navigation, the surrounding environmental perception, and control. Global Navigation Satellite System/Inertial Navigation System (GNSS/INS) is one of the significant components of any vehicle navigation system. However, GNSS has limitations in some operating scenarios such as urban regions and indoor environments where the GNSS signal suffers from multipath or outage. On the other hand, INS standalone navigation solution degrades over time due to the INS errors. Therefore, a modern vehicle navigation system depends on integration between different sensors to aid INS for mitigating its drift during GNSS signal outage. However, there are some challenges for the aiding sensors related to their high price, high computational costs, and environmental and weather effects. This paper proposes an integrated aiding navigation system for vehicles in an indoor environment (e.g., underground parking). This proposed system is based on optical flow and multiple mass flow sensors integrations to aid the low-cost INS by providing the navigation extended Kalman filter (EKF) with forward velocity and change of heading updates to enhance the vehicle navigation. The optical flow is computed for frames taken using a consumer portable device (CPD) camera mounted in the upward-looking direction to avoid moving objects in front of the camera and to exploit the typical features of the underground parking or tunnels such as ducts and pipes. On the other hand, the multiple mass flow sensors measurements are modeled to provide forward velocity information. Moreover, a mass flow differential odometry is proposed where the vehicle change of heading is estimated from the multiple mass flow sensors measurements. This integrated aiding system can be used for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and land vehicle navigations. However, the experimental results are implemented for land vehicles through the integration of CPD with mass flow sensors to aid the navigation system.

AB Road detection technology is an important part of the automatic driving environment perception system. With the development of technology, the situations that automatic driving needs to consider will become broader and more complex. This paper contributes a lightweight convolutional neural network model, incorporating novel convolution and parallel pooling modules, an improved network activation function, and comprehensive training and verification with multiple datasets. The proposed model achieves high accuracy in detecting drivable areas in complex autonomous driving situations while significantly improving real-time performance. In addition, we collect data in the field and create small datasets as reference datasets for testing algorithms. This paper designs relevant experimental scenarios based on the datasets and experimental platforms and conducts simulations and real-world vehicle experiments to verify the effectiveness and stability of the algorithm models and technical solutions. The method achieves an MIoU of 90.19 and a single batch time of 340 ms with a batch size of 8, which substantially reduces the runtime relative to a typical deep network structure like ResNet50.

AB This paper is concerned with the cooperative diving problem of homogenous under-actuated saucer-type autonomous underwater gliders subject to model uncertainties, input constraints as well as external disturbances. A modular back-stepping design method is used to design a robust adaptive cooperative diving controller for each glider. Especially, a kinematic control law is at first designed by employing a line-of-sight guidance principle, and a path variable update law is developed based on a synchronization strategy. Next, in order to identify the unknown dynamics of gliders, an estimation model is constructed by using a fuzzy approximation technique and a low-frequency learning scheme. Finally, it is proved that the closed-loop system is input-to-state stable by using a cascade stability analysis. The simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for cooperative diving of autonomous underwater gliders in a vertical plane.

AB In recent years, vision-aided inertial odometry for state estimation has matured significantly. However, we still encounter challenges in terms of improving the computational efficiency and robustness of the underlying algorithms for applications in autonomous flight with microaerial vehicles, in which it is difficult to use high-quality sensors and powerful processors because of constraints on size and weight. In this letter, we present a filter-based stereo visual inertial odometry that uses the multistate constraint Kalman filter. Previous work on the stereo visual inertial odometry has resulted in solutions that are computationally expensive. We demonstrate that our stereo multistate constraint Kalman filter (S-MSCKF) is comparable to state-of-the-art monocular solutions in terms of computational cost, while providing significantly greater robustness. We evaluate our S-MSCKF algorithm and compare it with state-of-the-art methods including OKVIS, ROVIO, and VINS-MONO on both the EuRoC dataset and our own experimental datasets demonstrating fast autonomous flight with a maximum speed of 17.5 m/s in indoor and outdoor environments.

AB This paper describes a research infrastructure setup to exercise and investigate guidance and control capabilities under human and autonomous control modalities. The lab facility is designed to implement tasks that emphasize agent-environment interactions. The overall goal is to characterize these interactions and to apply the gained knowledge to determine interaction models. These can then be used to design guidance and control algorithms as well as human-machine systems. The facility uses miniature rotorcraft as test vehicles with a Vicon motion tracking system and SensoMotoric gaze tracking system. The facility also includes a high-fidelity simulation system to support larger scale autonomy and teleoperation experiments. The simulation incorporates the software components and models of the key flight hardware and sensors. The software system was integrated around the Robotics Operating System (ROS) to support the heterogenous processes and data and allow easy system reconfiguration. The paper describes the research objectives, details of the hardware and software components and their integration, and concludes with a summary of the ongoing research enabled by the lab facility including.

AB With the development of global urbanization and the construction of regional urbanization, residents around urban cities are increasingly making demands on urban public transportation system. A new kind of modern public transportation vehicle named Multi-Articulated Guided Vehicle based on Virtual Track (MAAV-VT) with the advantages of beautiful, smart energy conservation and environmental protection is proposed in this paper, which aims at optimizing the public transportation system between and within urban areas. Therefore, concentrating on the general design and control strategy, the main contents of this paper are as follows. At first, the design concepts and key technologies of MAAV-VT are introduced. It is the fusion of urban rail transit operation mode and advanced automotive technologies, which have the characteristics of 100% low-floor, medium to high velocity, medium to big capacity, and low construction cost. Then, as the core subsystem, to guarantee the properties of self-guiding and trajectory tracking of the new vehicle, this paper is focused on the control system based on the dynamics and kinematics model of the whole multi-articulated vehicle. The multi-trace-points cooperative trajectory tracking control strategy on the basis of the circulation of feasible path generation method is proposed and the lateral controller is designed for trajectory tracking. The process of feasible path generation is conducted once the tracking error exceeded. A simulation platform is built considering the mechanical properties of each vehicle element and the characteristic of articulated mechanism. Finally, the function of control system is validated. The tracking error of each vehicle elements would be reduced to make sure the whole multi-articulated vehicle moves along the preset virtual track.

AB This letter presents a novel approach to build a compact lightweight unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) radar for remote sensing applications. The proposed radar exploits the recent advancement of an automotive radar chip for broadband chirp generation and rapid data processing. To compensate for the path losses and improve penetration at the millimeter-wave (mm-wave) frequency range, up- and down-converters are developed to generate an ultra-wideband (UWB) (3.25-5.15 GHz) chirp signal. The total payload of the radar is 2.5 kg. The proposed radar is installed on an UAV and tested in the field at a 100-m altitude above the ground surface. The results show that the compact low-power UWB radar can be used to map vegetation and soil moisture with fine resolution.

AB In advanced driver assistance systems to conditional automation systems, monitoring of driver state is vital for predicting the driver & x2019;s capacity to supervise or maneuver the vehicle in cases of unexpected road events and to facilitate better in-car services. The paper presents a technique that exploits millimeter-wave Doppler radar for 3D head tracking. Identifying the bistatic and monostatic geometry for antennas to detect rotational vs. translational movements, the authors propose the biscattering angle for computing a distinctive feature set to isolate dynamic movements via class memberships. Through data reduction and joint time & x2013;frequency analysis, movement boundaries are marked for creation of a simplified, uncorrelated, and highly separable feature set. The authors report movement-prediction accuracy of 92 & x0025;. This non-invasive and simplified head tracking has the potential to enhance monitoring of driver state in autonomous vehicles and aid intelligent car assistants in guaranteeing seamless and safe journeys.

AB While automotive original equipment manufacturers and IT companies are developing and demonstrating self-driving cars, true autonomy will not be realised in the near future due in part to the technology readiness level of the existing systems as well as issues of ethics, security, governance and standards surrounding the implementation of autonomy for road transport. However, advances in cellular phones and networks, satellite-based positioning and communications, cloud computing, combined with a rise in the volumes of available data, allied with a reduction in their costs, offer the very real possibility of connecting vehicles, one to another and to smart city infrastructure as part of the Internet of Things (IoT). Data from connected vehicles, when combined with other information, may provide valuable intelligence to traffic managers and other stakeholders via cooperative intelligent transport system (C-ITS) platforms. Nevertheless, many issues face the implementation of a truly connected IoT in general and C-ITS in particular.

AB In this paper we describe a computer vision-based traffic monitoring system able to detect individual vehicles in real-time. Our fully integrated system first obtains the main traffic variables: counting, speed and category; and then computes a complete set of statistical variables. The objective is to investigate some of the difficulties impeding existing traffic systems to achieve balanced accuracy in every condition; i.e. day and night transitions, shadows, heavy vehicles, occlusions, slow traffic and congestions. The system we present is autonomous, works for long periods of time without human intervention and adapts automatically to the changing environmental conditions. Several innovations, designed to deal with the above circumstances, are proposed in the paper: an integrated calibration and image rectification step, differentiated methods for day and night, an adaptive segmentation algorithm, a multistage shadow detection method and special considerations for heavy vehicle identification and treatment of slow traffic. A specific methodology has been developed to benchmark the accuracy of the different methods proposed.

AB This paper proposes an improved 3D-Vector Field Histogram (3D-VFH) algorithm for autonomous flight and local obstacle avoidance of multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a confined environment. Firstly, the method employs a target point coordinate system based on polar coordinates to convert the point cloud data, considering that long-range point cloud information has no effect on local obstacle avoidance by UAVs. This enables UAVs to effectively utilize obstacle information for obstacle avoidance and improves the real-time performance of the algorithm. Secondly, a sliding window algorithm is used to estimate the optimal flight path of the UAV and implement obstacle avoidance control, thereby maintaining the attitude stability of the UAV during obstacle avoidance flight. Finally, experimental analysis is conducted, and the results show that the UAV has good attitude stability during obstacle avoidance flight, can autonomously follow the expected trajectory, and can avoid dynamic obstacles, achieving precise obstacle avoidance.

AB Collective perception is one of the key ideas of vehicular networking and allows the exchange of data about perceived objects. However, unlike autonomous driving systems, human drivers cannot screen large numbers of objects to judge their dangerousness. An assistance system in the vehicle, therefore, must do this job. This article shows a concept for a human-machine interface that could be used to warn the driver in case such a system detects an actually dangerous object. A user study in a driving simulator was performed to evaluate its potential to prevent accidents. Eye-tracking glasses were used to analyze the driver's gaze during different types of situations. Furthermore, the participants' subjective experience was evaluated with a questionnaire. Results show that drivers trust the system and brake earlier and with more control due to the warnings, and ultimately, the majority of accidents could be avoided thanks to the warnings.

AB Considering the actual situation of time-varying interference in the underwater environment, a trajectory tracking control method for an underactuated Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) underwater exploration based on backstepping sliding mode with fuzzy switching gain is designed in this paper. Firstly, the motion equations of UUV in diving plane are given. Secondly, the virtual control variable is designed to replace the pitch angle to avoid the singular value phenomenon. Combining with the backstepping technique, the fuzzy switching sliding mode controller is proposed. Thirdly, in order to decrease the chattering phenomenon of sliding mode control, the fuzzy rule of sliding mode gain is designed. Fourthly, based on Lyapunov theory and comparison principle, the global asymptotic stability of UUV closed-loop tracking error system is proved. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller.

AB The rapid development of road networks in highly urbanized cities requires a substantial number of viaducts to reduce the increasing traffic burden on urban highways. Unfortunately, this road design deteriorates the performance of global positioning system (GPS) navigators due to the signal blockage between satellite and receiver. As a result, it is difficult for CPS navigators to determine whether the vehicle is driving on the street or viaduct. Misleading information could confuse drivers and lead them to drive irregularly, which is dangerous in heavy traffic. This paper proposes a novel classification algorithm based on the fact that different satellite signals and conditions can he observed in the on-street and on-viaduct cases by the implementation of dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to distinguish the driving area of a vehicle. In addition, the proposed DBN can also accurately estimate the driving altitude of the vehicle according to the experiment results.

TI MAGVA: An Open-Set Fault Diagnosis Model Based on Multi-Hop Attentive

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS

DE Open-set fault diagnosis; multi-hop attentive graph variational
   autoencoder; structural representation constraints; generative
   distance-based diagnosis algorithm
AB To improve the reliability of autonomous vehicles, open-set fault diagnosis is indispensable to jointly detect known and unknown faults, in which unknown faults only appear in the testing set. However, in learning the representations for open-set diagnosis, the extracted representations lack hierarchy to preserve high-level and genuine representations, and the final representations utilized for diagnosing lack distinctiveness to separate unknowns from knowns. In addition, in the stage of testing, the open-set diagnosis models are error-prone when unknowns are similar to knowns. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a Multi-hop Attentive Graph Variational Autoencoder (MAGVA) model for open-set fault diagnosis in this paper. First, a multi-hop attentive graph convolutional network is developed to adaptively extract hierarchical representations and eliminate unknown fault misidentification. Then, to avoid unknown faults occupying the same region as known faults and identify known faults, structural representation constraints are designed by jointly conducting reconstruction with an intra-class constraint and classification with an inter-class constraint. Finally, combining the distinguishable representations learned by MAGVA, a generative distance-based open-set diagnosis algorithm is proposed, in which the procedures of estimating class-conditional distributions are designed, and a relative generative distance is then presented to derive diagnosis results under the class-conditional distributions. Experiments on three commonly used bearing datasets for vehicles demonstrate that the proposed MAGVA consistently outperforms the compared models in open-set, closed-set, and unknown fault diagnosis.

AB In autonomous vehicles, perception information about the surrounding road environment can be obtained through image semantic segmentation. The fisheye camera commonly used in autonomous vehicle surround view systems offers a wide field of view (FoV), providing comprehensive perception information about the surrounding environment and assisting in understanding complex scenes. However, there is a challenge in model training due to the limited availability of fisheye semantic image datasets, resulting in reduced generalization performance and unreliable results in various test environments. In particular, changes in the position and orientation of the camera result in changes in the camera viewpoint, which can impair the model's segmentation performance. Generally, data scarcity problems are solved using augmentation methods, but existing methods have difficulty reflecting the distortion characteristics of fisheye images. To solve this problem, we propose viewpoint augmentation considering the spatially variant distortion characteristic of fisheye images. First, we use the fisheye camera projection model in reverse to map the captured 2D fisheye image to a point on the surface of a unit sphere in 3D. Then, we change the camera's orientation and position by applying rotation and translation operations to the point. Finally, we re-project the transformed point to the fisheye image to generate a fisheye image with a changed viewpoint. The experimental results show that the proposed augmentation method increases the generalization performance of the model and effectively reduces model performance degradation under changing camera viewpoints, making it suitable for practical applications.

AB In autonomous vehicles the driver will become a passenger. By ensuring a high level of ride comfort through active suspensions, the driver?s ability to perform various tasks such as reading, drawing and texting can be enhanced. A high-performance shaker rig can conveniently be used to test the ride comfort improvement by means of various active suspensions under laboratory conditions. The paper deals with the design of such a rig, which employs a linear electric servomotor to impose accurately controlled vertical vibrations of driver seat. The reference time profiles of seat acceleration, velocity and displacement are generated off-line by using a half-car vehicle model and LQR control with a road preview option. The selection of linear motor comes from assessment of three characteristic shaker rig drive designs (hydraulic and two electric ones). To ensure high-precision seat motion, the proposed shaker control system includes: acceleration feedforward and feedback control loops, a state controller-like compensator of accelerometer offset to prevent drift of seat position and velocity, and feedforward compensation of linear motor cogging force mode. The designed shaker rig application is demonstrated through a case study related to ride comfort evaluation of various active suspension configurations and a drawing task. The drawing task results are employed to determine the root-mean-square vertical seat acceleration threshold, below which the active suspension drawing task performance remains similar to that obtained under standstill conditions.

DE distributed models; holonic systems; route planning
AB Nowadays, the development of automated traffic systems has been gaining increasing attention, and a substantial amount of effort has been invested in trying to find a solution to problems associated with road transport. Among these problems are road accidents caused by human-related factors, such as tiredness, loss of control, a slow reaction time and limited field of view. Another transport-related problem is that of loss of time which may be caused by a slow driving speed due to weather conditions, road conditions, visibility, traffic congestion, etc. The general problem of automated road transportation system can be instantiated into more specific transportation domains, such as the transportation system in a city, in an airport, in a park, in a manufacturing plant. In this article, we present a holonic simulation environment for the Global Automated Transportation System in which a distributed multi-agent model is used to manage dynamic environments. The case study scenario presented in this article is related to a manufacturing plant. In this scenario, there are different transportation vehicles, such as automated guided vehicles, trucks, lift trucks and cars. These vehicles have different features that make the transportation planning a complex problem. Moreover, dynamic events are triggered to simulate anomalous situations in which a repairing process must be executed in order to maintain the transportation system into a security execution. The simulated results prove that a distributed multi-agent model for autonomous road transportation systems is a secure approach to manage critical situations and autonomous execution of different levels in the problem.

AB Car-sharing has emerged as a competitive technology for urban mobility. Combined with the upward trend in vehicle electrification and the promise of automation, it is expected that urban travel will change in fundamental ways in the near future. Indeed, breakthroughs in battery technology and the incentive programs offered by governments worldwide have resulted in a continued increase in the market share of electric vehicles. Automation frees passengers from having to drive and seek parking, it also offers increased flexibility when selecting pick up locations. These trends and incentives naturally suggest that shared automated electric vehicle (SAEV) systems will displace traditional gasoline-powered, human-driven car-sharing systems worldwide.
   Real-time vehicle dispatching operations in traditional car-sharing systems is an already computationally challenging scheduling problem. Electrification only exacerbates the computational difficulties as charge level constraints come into play. To overcome this complexity, we employ an online minimum drift plus penalty (MDPP) approach for SAEV systems that (i) does not require a priori knowledge of customer arrival rates to the different parts of the system (i.e. it is practical from a real-world deployment perspective), (ii) ensures the stability of customer waiting times, (iii) ensures that the deviation of dispatch costs from a desirable dispatch cost can be controlled, and (iv) has a computational time-complexity that allows for real-time implementation. Using an agent-based simulator developed for SAEV systems, we test the MDPP approach under two scenarios with real-world calibrated demand and charger distributions: 1) a low-demand scenario with long trips, and 2) a high-demand scenario with short trips. The comparisons with other algorithms under both scenarios show that the proposed online MDPP outperforms all other algorithms in terms of both reduced customer waiting times and vehicle dispatching costs.

AB Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) bring promise of increasing traffic capacity and energy efficiency by forming platoons with short headways on the road. However at low CAV penetration, the capacity gain will be small because the CAVs that randomly enter the road will be sparsely distributed, diminishing the probability of forming long platoons. Many researchers propose to solve this issue by platoon organization strategies, where the CAVs search for other CAVs on the road and change lanes if necessary to form longer platoons. However, the current literature does not analyze a potential risk of platoon organization in disrupting the flow and reducing the capacity by inducing more lane changes. In this research, we use driving model of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) vehicles and human-driven vehicles that are validated with field experiments and find that platoon organization can indeed drop the capacity with more lane changes. But when the traffic demand is well below capacity, platoon organization forms longer CAV platoons without reducing the flow. Based on this finding, we develop the Flow-Aware platoon organization strategy, where the CAVs perform platoon organization conditionally on the local traffic state, i.e., a low flow and a high speed. We simulate the Flow-Aware platoon organization on a realistic freeway network and show that the CAVs successfully form longer platoons, while ensuring a maximal traffic flow.

AB One of the steps to provide fundamental data for planning a mining effort is the magnetic surveying of a target area, which is typically carried out by conventional aircraft campaigns. However, besides the high cost, fixed-wing aerial vehicles present shortcomings especially for drape flights on mountainous regions, where steep slopes are often present. Traditional human-crewed flights have to perform tedious and dangerous trajectories, under strict velocity and attitude constraints. In this paper, we deal with the problem of accomplishing digital magnetic-elevation maps using autonomous and cooperative aerial robots. The proposed approach for autonomous mapping utilizes a custom-built fluxgate sensor and off the shelf cameras adapted for small airborne platforms. We also propose an innovative approach for generating a digital magnetic-elevation model from the gathered data. Our method was evaluated and validated in field tests in an industrial scenario to detect scrap metals in ore piles. Results show that the proposed method could reliably detect magnetic anomalies while generating accurate three-dimensional magnetic maps.

AB As a distributed deep learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) provides a powerful tool for the accurate and efficient processing of on-board data in vehicular edge computing (VEC). However, FL involves the training and transmission of model parameters, which consumes the vehicles' precious energy resources and takes up much time. It is a departure from many applications with severe real-time requirements in VEC. And the capabilities and data quality of each vehicle are distinct that will affect the performance of training the model. Therefore, it is crucial to select the appropriate vehicles to participate in learning tasks and optimize resource allocation under learning time and energy consumption constraints. In this paper, taking the vehicle position and velocity into consideration, we formulate a min-max optimization problem to jointly optimize the on-board computation capability, transmission power, and local model accuracy to achieve the minimum cost in the worst case of FL. Specifically, we propose a greedy algorithm to select vehicles with higher image quality dynamically, and it keeps the system's overall cost to a minimum in FL. The formulated optimization problem is a nonlinear programming problem, so we decompose it into two subproblems. For the resource allocation problem, we use the Lagrangian dual problem and the subgradient projection method to approximate the optimal value iteratively. For the local model accuracy problem, we develop an adaptive harmony algorithm for heuristic search. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithms have well convergence and effectiveness and achieve a tradeoff between cost and fairness.

AB This letter proposes a printed fifth-generation (5G) monopole antenna with a periodic patch director that can be applied to a laminated window glass of a vehicle. The proposed monopole antenna is printed on the laminated window glass, which does not require additional mounting space. The rectangular disk is loaded at the end of the monopole to improve a bore-sight gain. To further improve the gain characteristic, the periodic patch director elements are arranged with optimized array spacing. To verify the antenna performances, such as reflection coefficients and radiation patterns, the proposed antenna is fabricated and measured in a full anechoic chamber. The results demonstrate that the proposed monopole antenna with the periodic patch director is suitable for applying in vehicle 5G communication band of n257.

AB Precise positioning is a key issue for road vehicles in navigation, safety, and autonomous driving applications. While global positioning system (GPS) is widely accepted, it is still a challenge to achieve lane-level positioning. In this work, we consider the fusion of multi-sensory data using particle filter (PF), which is flexible in integrating different information in complex outdoor environments. We focus on three types of popular sensors: controller area network (CAN bus), GPS, and roadside camera. We propose a PF model that can adopt these types of sensory inputs for vehicle positioning. We show that in scenarios where vision sensory inputs are available, lane-level precision can be achieved. When there is no vision coverage, seamless localisation with reasonable precision can still be supported by GPS. Field trial results are presented to validate our model.

However, the marine renewable energy (MRE) has huge potential and can provide the possibility to solve this problem between essential endurance and finite energy in ocean robots. This paper starts with brief introduction of marine energy resource and ocean robots and presents significance of improving ocean robots' endurance, through comparison of their performance characteristics. MRE applied in ocean robots developed or under development, including energy conversion and driving principle, is reviewed, such as solar, wind, tides, waves, thermal energy, etc. Many challenges and difficulties are also discussed in energy exploitation and utilization related to ocean robots. Finally, the prospect for the future development of related technologies is proposed in this paper.

AB Recently, the development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mobile-edge computing (MEC) networks has brought unprecedented gains and opportunities. In this article, the joint computation offloading, UAV role, and location selection problem in hierarchical multicoalition UAV MEC network is investigated. To capture the hierarchical feature and discrete optimization, the discrete Stackelberg game with multiple leaders and followers is formulated. We prove that both the leader-level and member-level subgames are ordinal potential games (OPGs) with Nash equilibrium (NE). Thus, the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) is guaranteed. To achieve the SE, the log-linear-based hierarchical learning algorithm (LHLA) is proposed and analyzed. The simulation results show that the LHLA can converge fast and achieve better performance compared with the existing schemes.

AB Building representative real world drive cycles is an important component in the modelling of emissions, battery health of electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles. All these applications are sensitive to the transients and diversity present in real world driving patterns, which are not adequately captured by current approaches. To address this lacuna, we use clustering techniques involving time-series (shape) based distances on the raw data directly to obtain representative sets of real world drive cycles. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach using experimental data from a fleet of eight motorcycles run across five locations in India. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance based clustering gives optimal results. We give theoretical and experimental justification for our constructions. We believe that the constructed drive cycles using the proposed approach would help in assessing the impact of various policies aimed at building eco-friendly transportation systems.

AB The purpose of the work presented in this paper is to develop a robust method of autonomous vehicle localisation during soil tilling, using a 3D LiDAR sensor. The approach was developed for onland ploughing but is transferable to other applications with similar features. To detect a ploughing furrow from multiple layers in a 3D point cloud, a recognition method was employed consisting of two parallel and redundant branches: (1) detecting the furrow edge in each layer by identifying the characteristic step, and (2) approximating the unploughed surface by applying Euclidean clustering and linear least-squares line fitting. The redundant branches were then fused into a guidance directrix by RANSAC line fitting. To evaluate the algorithm, humanlabelled reference points of the furrow were obtained by elaborate manual labelling of the LiDAR ploughing data. The results of the recognition method were compared with the reference points, resulting in a minimum of 86 % identical recognised points, with a mean error of 6.5 mm.

AB As the techniques of autonomous driving become increasingly valued and universal, real-time semantic segmentation has become very popular and challenging in the field of deep learning and computer vision in recent years. However, in order to apply the deep learning model to edge devices accompanying sensors on vehicles, we need to design a structure that has the best trade-off between accuracy and inference time. In previous works, several methods sacrificed accuracy to obtain a faster inference time, while others aimed to find the best accuracy under the condition of real time. Nevertheless, the accuracies of previous real-time semantic segmentation methods still have a large gap compared to general semantic segmentation methods. As a result, we propose a network architecture based on a dual encoder and a self-attention mechanism. Compared with preceding works, we achieved a 78.6% mIoU with a speed of 39.4 FPS with a 1024 x 2048 resolution on a Cityscapes test submission.

AB In this study, a floating bracket device with visual inspection technology is developed for the autonomous launch and recovery of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). To improve the success rate of docking between USVs and brackets in the recovery process, a reasonable controller is proposed to realise the position/posture regulation of the bracket. The state space equation is used to establish a system model, and the specific parameters are identified by using collected motion data. A sectional-type control framework is designed by model predictive control (MPC), which can satisfy the control requirements in different motion stages. The simulation results verify the accuracy of the identification model and the rationality of the MPC controller. The docking experiments demonstrate that the floating bracket with the proposed control system can be applied to launch and recovery missions of USVs.

AB Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are widely used for transporting materials in industry and commerce. In this research, an intelligent AGV-based material-handling system was developed using a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach. The core of the AGV, the controller, was designed in the system modelling language environment using Visual Paradigm software, and then implemented in the hardware. As the result, the AGV's complex tasks of material handling, navigation, and communication were successfully accomplished and tested in the real industrial environment. The developed AGV is capable of towing trolleys with a weight of up to 200kg at walking speed. The AGV can be incorporated into an intelligent material-handling system with multiple autonomous vehicles and work stations, thus providing flexibility and reconfigurability for the whole manufacturing system. Ergonomic and safety aspects were also considered in the design of the AGV. A comprehensive safety system that is compliant with industrial standards was implemented.

AB This study comparatively tests the performance of two real-time PPP services used in automated vehicle technologies, namely Trimble CenterPoint RTX and TerraStar-C Pro. This test focuses on the convergence time and the accuracy performance of these two services. The convergence time determination test was conducted in a partially obstructed environment in a static position of the autonomous vehicle. The convergence time to obtain the Trimble CenterPoint RTX service's cm-level accuracy is between 50 and 60 min after the cold-start, while this duration is nearly 2-3 min for TerraStar-C Pro. The accuracy test is conducted in a highly obstructed environment in kinematic mode. The results revealed that the Trimble CenterPoint RTX Technology provides 17 and 27 cm accuracy in 2D position and height components, respectively. In contrast, the TerraStar-C Pro service offers 9 and 15 cm accuracies in 2D position and height components.

AB Despite the surge in a vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) and volunteer computing research, future high-end vehicles are expected to under-utilize the onboard computation, storage and communication resources. Therefore, this research envisions the next paradigm shift by merging VANET and volunteer computing, which we call VANET based volunteer computing (or VBVC). To date, the potential design system for VBVC has not been characterized. To fill up this gap, we first set forth the scientific classification of VBVC, which uses the automobiles alongside roadside units (RSU) to give computational administrations to different vehicles on the road. We propose a potential framework for different VBVC scenarios. Moreover, we provide an experimental evaluation of VBVC by comparing it with the traditional model in terms of job completion, latency, and throughput. The proposed VBVC performs better when compared with traditional approaches.

AB In the present study, we propose a trajectory optimization and replanning algorithm for micro air vehicles (MAVs) in cluttered environments. To generate the path of an MAV in a cluttered environment, we first design an offline global path optimization algorithm. This algorithm generates a global trajectory for safe aerial delivery; this trajectory enables an MAV to avoid static obstacles marked in the navigation map and satisfies the MAV's initial and arrival velocities. The MAV's trajectory is replanned by exploiting dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) and a time adjustment algorithm to enable computationally efficient unknown obstacle avoidance in local path planning. To validate the applicability of the proposed algorithm, we compare simulation results with those obtained using an existing approach based on DMPs. Furthermore, an autonomous flight is demonstrated in an outdoor environment using a custom-made MAV driven by the proposed approach.

AB Underwater navigation technology is the guarantee to ensure the underwater vehicles complete all tasks. A gravity passive aided strapdown inertial navigation system is proposed in order to improve the precision of position of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Improved unscented Kalman filter (IUKF) is applied in the novel integrated system which is based on gravity gradient characteristics. The main characteristics of strapdown inertial navigation system are presented, gravity-aided navigation system are introduced, and IUKF method is applied to the information fusion of integrated navigation system. Simulation experiments were carried out and the results show that the novel integrated navigation system proposed can get better performance of position precision comparing to the traditional Kalman filtering methods. The simulation experiment results suggest that the IUKF method applied in the gravity passive aided navigation system is capable of greatly improving the long-time navigation position, attitude and velocity precision comparing with the traditional information fusion method.

AB To avoid collisions, Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) flying in teams require estimates of their relative locations, preferably with minimal mass and processing burden. We present a relative localization method where MAVs need only to communicate with each other using their wireless transceiver. The MAVs exchange on- board states (velocity, height, orientation) while the signal strength indicates range. Fusing these quantities provides a relative location estimate. We used this for collision avoidance in tight areas, testing with up to three AR. Drones in a 4m x 4m area and with two miniature drones ( 50 g) in a 2 m x 2 m area. The MAVs could localize each other and fly several minutes without collisions. In our implementation, MAVs communicated using Bluetooth antennas. The results were robust to the high noise and disturbances in signal strength. They could improve further by using transceivers with more accurate signal strength readings.

AB This paper addresses the directional control problem of autonomous air vehicles in order to obtain trajectory tracking capabilities when flying in other than calm conditions. The control strategy is designed in the framework of the Lyapunov theory, and adaptive techniques are employed for online wind identification. An application of light fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles that consists in tracking straight-line paths between geo-referenced waypoints is first formulated, and the dynamic of the cross track error with respect to such trajectory is further obtained from the lateral airplane equations of motion. The dynamic order of the closed-loop adaptive system is guaranteed to be minimal by choosing the proper variables so that the tuning functions method could be applied. Several simulations taking into account unknown wind have been performed to analyze the behavior and the robustness of the control scheme. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID CRASHES; SYSTEMS
AB Autonomous Emergency Braking on Motorcycles (MAEB) was shown to be a promising technology to improve Powered-Two-Wheeler (PTW) user safety, deploying autonomously a braking action to reduce impact speed when pre-crash conditions are detected. The applicability of MAEB with effective working parameters still needs to be proved in real-world working conditions. The goal of this paper is to define MAEB working parameters for effective mitigation of injuries and to validate their real-world applicability through field tests in representative riding scenarios of intervention.
   The results of previous studies and injury risk functions for motorcyclists were employed to define a set of MAEB working parameters (duration of intervention = 0.60 s, target declaration of 0.5 g, fade-in jerk of 2 g/s) which enable MAEB impact speed reductions capable of mitigating injuries. Field tests were then carried out involving common riders as participants and employing a test protocol consistent with previous studies. Automatic Braking (AB) interventions were intended to reproduce unexpected MAEB activations in different riding conditions including straight-line riding and lane-change manoeuvres reproducing an avoidance action. The tests were carried out using a sport-touring motorcycle provided with extension arms to prevent capsizing and equipped with an automatic braking system which was activated remotely by researchers.
   Thirty-one participants involved in the test experienced AB interventions riding in straight-line and lane-change at a mean speed ranging from 41 km/h to 47 km/h. In the 0.5 g test session, the AB system performed mean deceleration 0.48 g reached with 2.0 g/s fade-in jerk for a duration of around 1.1 s. Both subjective assessment and vehicle data analysis indicated that the participants were consistently able to easily control the vehicle during the automatic braking interventions and were always able to complete a lane-change manoeuvre. No signal of incipient loss of vehicle control was recorded in on-board videos nor identified in the behaviour and body movement by participants. The tested MAEB working parameters performed speed reductions capable to reduce impact speed up to 15 km/h, potentially reducing serious injuries (MAIS3+) by 15 %.
   The proposed MAEB working parameters were proved as effective in reducing vehicle speed and feasible from end-users' perspective. The designed MAEB intervention was shown to be applicable in straight line riding and to allow the rider to manoeuvre the vehicle for the execution of avoidance actions.

SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS

DT Article
DE cooperative robots; localization; perception
ID MULTIROBOT LOCALIZATION; FUSION
AB To navigate autonomously, a vehicle must be able to localize itself with respect to its driving environment and the vehicles with which it interacts. This study presents a decentralized cooperative localization method. It is based on the exchange of local dynamic maps (LDM), which are cyber-physical representations of the physical driving environment containing poses and kinematic information about nearby vehicles. An LDM acts as an abstraction layer that makes the cooperation framework sensor-agnostic, and it can even improve the localization of a sensorless communicating vehicle. With this goal in mind, this study focuses on the property of consistency in LDM estimates. Uncertainty in the estimates needs to be properly modeled, so that the estimation error can be statistically bounded for a given confidence level. To obtain a consistent system, we first introduce a decentralized fusion framework that can cope with LDMs whose errors have an unknown degree of correlation. Second, we present a consistent method for estimating the relative pose between vehicles, using a two-dimensional LiDAR (light detection and ranging) with a point-to-line metric within an iterative-closest-point approach, combined with communicated polygonal shape models. Finally, we add a bias estimator to reduce position errors when nondifferential GNSS (global navigation satellite system) receivers are used, based on visual observations of features geo-referenced in a high-definition map. Real experiments were conducted, and the consistency of our approach was demonstrated on a platooning scenario using two experimental vehicles. The full experimental data set used in this study is publicly available.

AB Range anxiety and charging infrastructure scarcity have been the main challenges for the mass adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). The emerging mobile electric-vehicle-to-electric-vehicle (mE2) charging technology offers a promising solution, which combines battery-to-battery and connected and autonomous vehicle technologies to enable an EV with an extra battery to charge another EV on the move. This paper focuses on the efficient pairing and routing of electricity providers (EPs) to demand (EDs) by extending the existing Charging-as-a-Service (CaaS) strategy to the mE2 charging service (referred to as CaaS(+)). We investigate the EP fleet management problem, which is mathematically modeled as a vehicle routing problem (i.e., mE2-VRP), aiming to optimally dispatch the minimum number of EPs to approach and serve the EDs. To adapt mE2 charging strategy to the online service involving large-scale EDs in practice, we develop a Clustering-aid Decomposition and Merging (c-DM) algorithm. It clusters the EDs according to their coalition potential so that we can decompose a large-scale mE2-VRP into smaller sub-problems which can be efficiently solved by parallel computing. Our numerical experiments built upon citywide (Chicago) and statewide (Florida) case studies confirm the efficiency of the proposed c-DM algorithm. It enables us to investigate the performance of CaaS(+) under a realistic large-scale setup. The results show that CaaS(+) will be applied in different proportions of EV flows to save EDs' travel time and mitigate traffic congestion to different extents in different network congestion and charging station coverage scenarios. The sensitivity analyses of EDs' energy inventory and range anxiety also provide some hints and suggestions for improving the service efficiency of CaaS(+).

AB This study introduces a strategy inspired by cooperative behavior in nature to enhance information sharing among autonomous vehicles (AVs), advancing intelligent transportation systems. However, in the context of multiple light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-equipped vehicles cooperating, the generated point cloud data can obstruct real-time environment perception. This research assumes real-time, lossless data transmission, and accurate and reliable pose information sharing between cooperative vehicles. Based on human-inspired principles and computer imaging techniques, a method was proposed to encode dynamic grids for fusion LiDAR point cloud data, contingent upon inter-vehicle distances. Each grid cell corresponds to an image pixel, creating smaller cells for dense point clouds and larger cells for sparse point clouds. This maintains an approximately equal number of point clouds per cell. Additionally, a ground segmentation approach is developed, based on density and elevation differences of adjacent grids to retain significant obstacle points. A grid density-based adjacent clustering approach was proposed, which effectively classified the connected grid cells containing the obstacle points. Experiments using the robot operating system on a standard computer with public data show that the perception processing period for six cooperative vehicles is merely 43.217 ms. This demonstrates the efficacy of our method in handling large volumes of LiDAR point cloud data. Comparative analysis with three alternative methods confirmed the superior accuracy and recall of our clustering approach. This underscores the robustness of our biologically inspired methodology for the design of cooperative perception, thereby promoting efficient and safe vehicle navigation.

AB The significance of forecasting the behavior of road agents is on the rise, particularly in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) enhancement. Predicting road agents' intentions holds paramount importance for Autonomous vehicles, especially considering the forthcoming coexistence of ADAS systems with heterogeneous road entities within urban roadways. The behavioral attributes of non-lane based traffic, featuring a mix of various elements, are prevalent not only in urban scenarios but also in unstructured environments. This research aims to predict the movement patterns of surrounding vehicles in non-lane based environments. This study captures the surrounding vehicles' intent to utilize tight lateral spaces in non-lane based environments through the variations of lateral descriptor values. The investigation takes into account several factors, including leveraging contextual cues, retaining spatial data related to neighboring vehicles, and identifying driving patterns. To achieve these objectives, a hybrid model is introduced, combining a modified structured Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) with lateral descriptor based uncertainty estimation on top of established detection and tracking algorithms. This integration enhances the ability to capture spatial attributes of neighboring vehicles along with the assessment of traffic conflict indicators with lateral descriptor contextual cues. The methodology is evaluated across two distinct datasets: one simulating scenarios of neighboring vehicles within well-defined urban road setups, and the other representing non-structured environments. The empirical findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method, showcasing an impressive 24.69% enhancement in prediction accuracy compared to baseline models with 5-seconds prediction horizon.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to quantify the impact of traffic density and verbal tasks on takeover performance in highly automated driving.
   Background: In highly automated vehicles, the driver has to occasionally take over vehicle control when approaching system limits. To ensure safety, the ability of the driver to regain control of the driving task under various driving situations and different driver states needs to be quantified.
   Methods: Seventy-two participants experienced takeover situations requiring an evasive maneuver on a three-lane highway with varying traffic density (zero, 10, and 20 vehicles per kilometer). In a between-subjects design, half of the participants were engaged in a verbal 20-Questions Task, representing speaking on the phone while driving in a highly automated vehicle.
   Results: The presence of traffic in takeover situations led to longer takeover times and worse takeover quality in the form of shorter time to collision and more collisions. The 20-Questions Task did not influence takeover time but seemed to have minor effects on the takeover quality.
   Conclusions: For the design and evaluation of human-machine interaction in takeover situations of highly automated vehicles, the traffic state seems to play a major role, compared to the driver state, manipulated by the 20-Questions Task.
   Application: The present results can be used by developers of highly automated systems to appropriately design human-machine interfaces and to assess the driver's time budget for regaining control.

AB Regular defect inspection of the bridge's bottom is necessary for the maintenance of the bridge. Usually, conducting such an inspection with traditional under bridge inspection vehicles (UBIVs) is high-cost and laborious. To improve the inspection efficiency, the newly developed unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technique may provide a promising alternative solution. As the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is not available under the bridge, the robust positioning of the UAV is still a challenge during fully autonomous inspections. Although accumulated works have attempted to utilize visual odometry to localize the UAV, their performance may easily deteriorate under simultaneously existed varying illumination and intense light noises. To cope with this issue, we design a ground-air mobile system and a dual-source positioning algorithm to enhance the robustness of the UAV's positioning. Specifically, the ground part of the mobile system is a ground vehicle (GV) equipped with infrared markers, which provides the referential fiducials for the relative positioning of the UAV. To well identify the infrared markers, the spatial relationship between the UAV and the GV is first optimized by an observation model. Then, to guarantee the robustness of marker detection, both color image and infrared image are simultaneously captured, and a dual-source algorithm is proposed accordingly. To implement the algorithm, a candidate region containing the infrared markers is first identified by a deep convolutional neural network. Subsequently, this candidate region projects to the infrared image, and a searching-tracking-aiming algorithm robustly detects those infrared markers. Following the marker detection, the position of the UAV can be finally estimated by a perspective-3-point algorithm of the marker and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) compensation. To verify the performance of the developed positioning approach, we conduct various real-world experiments in challenging light conditions under the bridge. The results demonstrate that our ground-air system and dual-source algorithm can provide robust positioning for the UAV in intense light noises and varying illumination during the bridge inspection.

AB This paper investigates the adaptive prescribed performance trajectory tracking control problem for underactuated underwater vehicles subjected to unmodeled hydrodynamics, ocean disturbances and input quantization. The controller is synchronized through the command filter-based backstepping design and minimum learning parameter algorithm, thus the adverse effect of "explosion of complexity" and computational complexity inherent in neural network is avoided. To endow tracking errors with prescribed performance guarantees, a mapping function is applied such that the constrained control problem could be transformed to the unconstrained one. By resorting to the hysteresis quantizer, the frequency of data transmission is considerably reduced and the quantization errors are effectively reduced under the proposed control scheme. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, it is verified that the proposed method is capable of ensuring asymptotic stability for tracking errors. Numerical simulation results reveal the advantage and effectiveness of this work.

AB Wireless recharging by autonomous power delivery vehicles is an attractive maintenance solution for Internet of Things devices. Improving the operating efficiency of power delivery vehicles is challenging due to complex dynamic environments and the need to solve difficult optimization problems to determine the best combination of routes, number of vehicles, and numerous safety thresholds prior to deployment. The optimal recharge scheduling problem considers minimizing discharged energy of drones while maximizing devices' recharged energy. In this paper, a configurable optimal recharge scheduler is proposed that incorporates several evolutionary and clustering approaches. A modified version of the Black Hole algorithm is presented, which is shown to execute on average 35% faster than the state of the art genetic approach, while delivering comparable performance in simulation across 18 scenarios with varying area and density of sensor nodes deployed under different initialization scenarios.

AB Action intention recognition is becoming increasingly important in the road vehicle automation domain. Autonomous vehicles must be aware of their surroundings if we are to build safe and efficient transport systems. This paper presents a method for predicting the action intentions of road users based on sensors in the road infrastructure. The scenarios used for demonstration are recorded on two different public road sections. The first scenario includes bicyclists and the second includes cars that are driving in a road approaching an intersection where they are either leaving or continuing straight. A 3D camera-based data acquisition system is used to collect trajectories of the road users that are used as input for models trained to predict the action intention of the road users. The proposed system enables future connected and automated vehicles to receive collision warnings from an infrastructure-based sensor system well in advance to enable better planning.

DT Article
DE Receding horizon control; temporal logic; formal methods
AB We present a receding horizon method for controlling an autonomous vehicle that must satisfy a rich mission specification over service requests occurring at the regions of a partitioned environment. The overall mission specification consists of a temporal logic statement over a set of static, a priori known requests, a regular expression over a set of dynamic requests that can be sensed only locally, and a servicing priority order over these dynamic requests. Our approach is based on two main steps. First, we construct an abstraction for the motion of the vehicle in the environment by using input-output linearization and assignment of vector fields to the regions in the partition. Second, a receding horizon controller computes local plans within the sensing range of the vehicle such that both local and global mission specifications are satisfied. We implement and evaluate our method through experiments and simulations consisting of a quadrotor performing a persistent surveillance task over a planar grid environment.

AB Semantic segmentation has made striking progress due to the success of deep convolutional neural networks. Considering the demands of autonomous driving, real-time semantic segmentation has become a research hotspot these years. However, few real-time RGB-D fusion semantic segmentation studies are carried out despite readily accessible depth information nowadays. In this letter, we propose a real-time fusion semantic segmentation network termed RFNet that effectively exploits complementary cross-modal information. Building on an efficient network architecture, RFNet is capable of running swiftly, which satisfies autonomous vehicles applications. Multi-dataset training is lever-aged to incorporate unexpected small obstacle detection, enriching the recognizable classes required to face unforeseen hazards in the real world. A comprehensive set of experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework. On Cityscapes, Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art semantic segmenters, with excellent accuracy and 22 Hz inference speed at the full 2048 x 1024 resolution, outperforming most existing RGB-D networks.

ID DIAL-A-RIDE; VEHICLE; TRANSIT; SERVICE; TIME
AB Microtransit and other flexible transit fleet services can reduce costs by incorporating transfers. However, transfers are costly to users if they must get off a vehicle and wait at a stop for another pickup. A mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) is proposed to solve pickup and de-livery problems with vehicle-synchronized en-route transfers (PDPSET). The transfer location is determined by the model and can be located at any candidate node in the network rather than a static facility defined in advance. The transfer operation is strictly synchronized between vehicles within a hard time window. A heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the problem with an acceptable solution in a much shorter computation time than commercial software. Two sets of synthetic numerical experiments are tested: small-scale instances based on a 5x5 grid network, and large-scale instances of varying network sizes up to 250x250 grids to test scalability. The results show that adding synchronized en-route transfers in microtransit can further reduce the total cost by 10% on average and maximum savings can reach up to 19.6% in our small-scale test instances. The heuristic on average has an optimality gap less than 1.5% while having a fraction of the run time and can scale up to 250x250 grids with run times within 1 min. Two large-scale examples demonstrate that over 50% of vehicle routes can be further improved by synchronized en-route transfers and the maximum savings in vehicle travel distance that can reach up to 20.37% for the instance with 100 vehicles and 300 requests on a 200x200 network.

AB High-end vehicles are already equipped with safety systems, such as assistive braking and automatic lane following, enhancing vehicle safety. Yet, these current solutions can only help in low-complexity driving situations. In this paper, we introduce a parallel autonomy, or shared control, framework that computes safe trajectories for an automated vehicle, based on human inputs. We minimize the deviation from the human inputs while ensuring safety via a set of collision avoidance constraints. Our method achieves safe motion even in complex driving scenarios, such as those commonly encountered in an urban setting. We introduce a receding horizon planner formulated as nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), which includes the analytic descriptions of road boundaries and the configuration and future uncertainties of other road participants. The NMPC operates over both steering and acceleration simultaneously. We introduce a nonslip model suitable for handling complex environments with dynamic obstacles, and a nonlinear combined slip vehicle model including normal load transfer capable of handling static environments. We validate the proposed approach in two complex driving scenarios. First, in an urban environment that includes a left-turn across traffic and passing on a busy street. And second, under snow conditions on a race track with sharp turns and under complex dynamic constraints. We evaluate the performance of the method with various human driving styles. We consequently observe that the method successfully avoids collisions and generates motions with minimal intervention for parallel autonomy. We note that the method can also be applied to generate safe motion for fully autonomous vehicles.

AB Micro drones have been widely applied in applications, such as aerial cinematography and environment exploration. Due to the presence of numerous demanding scenes, such as crowded obstacles and dynamic objects, remotely controlling a drone poses a significant challenge for humans. As a result, there is an urgent need for highly autonomous flight capabilities. This article presents a fully autonomous flight system in a complex dynamic environment, showing satisfactory performance in real-world tests, and outperforms the state-of-the-art works in both dynamic object perception, and flight safety and efficiency. A lightweight but effective multiobject velocimetry based on a cross-correlation algorithm and local points feature is proposed, with a robust image-based object classifier as the front end. Also, we plan the flight trajectory considering the camera's field of view and the uncertainty in the dynamic object's constant velocity model. At last, we further explore the benefits of vehicle's active yaw control for improving perception quality and flight safety.

AB The aim of this study is to develop an autonomous mobile robot (AMR) for our demonstration factory, incorporating Google's Cartographer algorithm with the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control model and providing safe navigation with obstacle avoidance for the delivery of recycling metal shaving (RMS) with the help of this Cartographer-LQG method. The originality of this study is that we have integrated Google's Cartographer algorithm with the LQG model and improved the accuracy and stability of our AMR-RMS. This method offers users a reliable method for calibrating their mobile robots and constructs a grid map with loop-closure to automate navigation. The suggested approach increases the stability of the electro-mechanical modules and lowers the cumulative error of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). This study has compared the SLAM results from Gmapping, Hector, and Cartographer algorithms, suggesting that the Cartographer-LQG method can provide a map with loop closure and accurate information for autopiloting the AMR-RMS.

AB By transmitting lasers and processing laser returns, LiDAR (light detection and ranging) perceives the surrounding environment through distance measurements. Because of high ranging accuracy, LiDAR is one of the most critical sensors in autonomous driving systems. Revolving around the 3D point clouds generated from LiDARs, plentiful algorithms have been developed for object detection/tracking, environmental mapping, or localization. However, a LiDAR's ranging performance suffers under adverse weather (e.g. fog, rain, snow etc.), which impedes full autonomous driving in all weather conditions. This article focuses on analyzing the performance of a typical time-of-flight (ToF) LiDAR under fog environment. By controlling the fog density within CEREMA Adverse Weather Facility, the relations between the ranging performance and fogs are both qualitatively and quantitatively investigated. Furthermore, based on the collected data, a machine learning based model is trained to predict the minimum fog visibility that allows successful ranging for this type of LiDAR. The revealed experimental results and methods are helpful for ToF LiDAR specifications from automotive industry.

AB This paper presents an overview of the Volcan Project, whose goal is the realization of an autonomous aerial system able to perform aerial surveillance of volcanic areas and to analyze the composition of gases inside volcanic plumes. There are increasing experimental evidences that measuring the chemical composition of volcanic gases can contribute to forecast volcanic eruptions. However, in situ gas sampling is a difficult operation and often exposes scientists to significant risks. At this aim, an Unmanned Aircraft System equipped with remote sensing technologies, able to sense the plume in the proximity of the crater, has been developed. In this paper, the aerial platform will be presented, together with the problems related to the flight in a hard scenario like the volcanic one and the tests performed with the aim of finding the right configuration for the vehicle. The developed autonomous navigation system and the sensors unit for gas analysis will be introduced; at the end, several experimental results will be described.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) can capture multiview images of large-scale scenes, and then using aerial light field (ALF)-rendering technology, they can render high-quality, large-scale 3D scenes. However, the reconstruction of large-scale scenes poses challenges, such as rendering distortion and high memory consumption. In this article, we study the multiview image-capturing and novel view-rendering method of UAV sampling to address these issues. First, we present an ALF sampling model using the spectral analysis of light field and obtain an exact spectrum expression of the ALF. Through the spectral support of ALF, we determine the bandwidth and calculate the minimum required UAV sampling rate. Finally, we demonstrate that our sampling and rendering methods can improve the rendering quality of UAV 3D reconstruction and reduce the minimum sampling rate.

AB This paper devotes to tackling the saturated approximation-free tracking control problem for unmanned marine surface vehicles with prescribed performance metrics. Firstly, a smooth dead zone-based model is introduced herein to address the saturation nonlinearity. Then, the tracking error dynamics in presence of saturation constraints and uncertainties are formulated accordingly. After that, the capability to preset the evolution range of tracking errors is guaranteed by means of the prescribed performance technology. It follows that a saturated approximation-free control scheme is developed based on the sliding mode control. Notably, the lumped uncertainties and the saturation nonlinearity are well handled totally free of the online estimations such that the control scheme is simple and intuitiveness for implementation. It is theoretically verified that the controller can achieve the stabilization of the system. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate the controller's efficacy.

AB In today's world, automatic navigation for a robotic device (autonomous vehicle and robot) is a pre-requisite for many complex tasks, which requires a robust localization method. We focus in this paper on the topic of localizing such a robot into an absolute and imprecise map. We propose a multi-sensor self-localization method, which is simultaneously able to operate with an imprecise map, as well as to improve the precision of an already existing one. The method uses split covariance intersection filter as well as an a priori selection of the best informative measurements out of all possible measurement sources at each time step. This selection scheme is based on an "added Shannon information" based criterion. We demonstrate in operation via statistical analysis the consistency of a refined map obtained from a biased map while keeping vehicle localization integrity. On top of this, we demonstrate solving of the so-called kidnapped-robot problem using the same framework.

AB Large-scale aerial sensing missions can greatly benefit from the perpetual endurance capability provided by high-performance low-altitude solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, today these UAVs suffer from small payload capacity, low energetic margins, and high operational complexity. To tackle these problems, this paper presents four individual technical contributions and integrates them into an existing solar-powered UAV system: First, a lightweight and power-efficient day/night-capable sensing system is discussed. Second, means to optimize the UAV platform to the specific payload and to thereby achieve sufficient energetic margins for day/night flight with payload are presented. Third, existing autonomous launch and landing functionality is extended for solar-powered UAVs. Fourth, as a main contribution an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based autonomous thermal updraft tracking framework is developed. Its novelty is that it allows the end-to-end integration of the thermal-induced roll moment into the estimation process. It is assessed against unscented Kalman filter and particle filter methods in simulation and implemented on the aircraft's low-power autopilot. The complete system is verified during a 26h search-and-rescue aerial sensing mock-up mission that represents the first-ever fully autonomous perpetual endurance flight of a small solar-powered UAV with a day/night-capable sensing payload. It also represents the first time that solar-electric propulsion and autonomous thermal updraft tracking are combined in flight. In contrast to previous work that has focused on the energetic feasibility of perpetual flight, the individual technical contributions of this paper are considered core functionality to guarantee ease-of-use, effectivity, and reliability in future multiday aerial sensing operations with small solar-powered UAVs.

AB Supervised deep learning methods using image data as input have shown promising results in the context of vehicle control. However, these supervised methods have two main disadvantages: 1) They require a copious amount of labeled training data, which is difficult and expensive to collect. 2) Such models do not perform well, when situations that are not in the distribution of the training set are encountered. This includes deviations from the designated driving behavior. We therefore provide a framework to mitigate these problems from merely an unlabeled sequence of images. Visual Odometry is first used to determine the vehicle trajectory. Model Predictive Control (MPC) then uses this trajectory to implicitly infer the steering labels. Meanwhile, synthesized images at deviated trajectories are included in the training distribution for enhanced robustness of the neural network model. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of our network is at par with methods requiring additional data collection or supervision. Code and supplementary information is available here:

AB T-bone collision constitutes an emergency crash scenario that results in casualties and heavy losses; it is an excessively complicated scenario that cannot be handled by conventional control systems. This paper presents an innovative crash mitigation controller for application during unavoidable T-bone collisions to expand the vehicle-maneuverability envelope and minimize crash severity; this controller combines prior knowledge using an optimum expert-behavior policy and drift-operation mechanism based on an improved reinforcement learning algorithm, TD3. Vehicle and tire modeling are performed considering the nonlinear and coupled dynamics characteristics to improve control accuracy. Unlike conventional control systems and other reinforcement learning algorithms, the proposed controller realizes the optimum crash mitigation effect under different scenarios. It is expected to afford autonomous driving technologies with enhanced operating capabilities under extreme conditions.(c) 2022 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a new experimental method for the estimation of hydrodynamic parameters of underwater vehicles, namely the added mass and drag coefficients. The principle is to accurately record the movement of the vehicle in response to a known time-varying actuating force, and find an optimal solution for the parameters that allows simulating a velocity trajectory that fits the recorded trajectory. The optimal solution is obtained using a Numerical Integration Fitting method, which, employing an error minimization algorithm, successively generates velocity trajectories through numerical integration until the parameters converge. This method is applied to determine the hydrodynamic parameters of a torpedo-shaped Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The hydrodynamic parameters obtained are compared and found to be close to their theoretical values. In addition, the use of a time-varying force is shown to provide better and more reliable results than the use of a constant or zero external force.

AB The vector field method was originally proposed to guide a single fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) towards a desired path. In this work, a non-uniform vector field method is proposed that changes in both magnitude and direction, for the purpose of achieving formations of UAVs. As compared to related work in the literature, the proposed formation control law does not need to assume absence of wind. That is, due to the effect of the wind on the UAV, one can handle the UAV air speed being different from its ground speed, and the UAV heading angle being different from its course angle. Stability of the proposed formation method is analyzed via Lyapunov stability theory, and validations are carried out in software-in-the-loop and hardware-in-the-loop comparative experiments.

AB The rise of research into shared mobility systems reflects emerging challenges, such as rising traffic congestion, rising oil prices and rising environmental concern. The operations research community has turned towards more sharable and sustainable systems of transportation. Shared mobility systems can be collapsed into two main streams: Those where people share rides and those where parcel transportation and people transportation are combined. This survey sets out to review recent research in this area, including different optimization approaches, and to provide guidelines and promising directions for future research. It makes a distinction between prearranged and real-time problem settings and their methods of solution, and also gives an overview of real-case applications relevant to the research area.

AB We present a quadrotor Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) equipped with four cameras, which are arranged in two stereo configurations. The MAV is able to perform stereo matching for each camera pair on-board and in real-time, using an efficient sparse stereo method. In case of the camera pair that is facing forward, the stereo matching results are used for a reduced stereo SLAM system. The other camera pair, which is facing downwards, is used for ground plane detection and tracking. Hence, we are able to obtain a full 6DoF pose estimate from each camera pair, which we fuse with inertial measurements in an extended Kalman filter. Special care is taken to compensate various drift errors. In an evaluation we show that using two instead of one camera pair significantly increases the pose estimation accuracy and robustness.

AB In the area of underwater autonomous localization based on geomagnetic anomaly inversion, it is a challenge to obtain the magnitude of magnetic dipole field from data measured by magnetometers, due to the existence of geomagnetic background field, where geomagnetic anomaly comes from magnetic dipole target. We propose, in this letter, a localization method combined with magnetic gradient tensor and draft depth, where the distance in vertical direction between underwater vehicle and the target can be calculated by measurements at two draft depths. On the other hand, to avoid movement of the underwater vehicle, the magnetic moment of the target is used to form an equation group about position of the vehicle, which is solved to realize continuous underwater localization. The detailed principle and steps of this continuous localization algorithm are described in detail, and its good performances, such as high-precision and fast convergence, are proved by theoretical analysis and numerical simulation.

AB The introduction of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) presents a wide range of challenges and uncertainties regarding their general acceptability. Hence, it is essential that transit managers have a good understanding of passenger satisfaction and of their behavioural intentions after experiencing a driverless vehicle trip. To this end, 1,062 face-to-face surveys were conducted following driverless bus trials in eight Catalan (Spain) municipalities. Using a three-step SEMMIMIC ordinal Probit approach, we seek to identi f y the heterogeneity in user perceptions and reuse intentions, a novelty in SAV literature. Specifically, we analyse the users ' behavioural intention to repeat a journey without transit support personnel on the bus and when entirely alone, and how willing they are to substitute their regular bus service with a driverless one. Ou r results confirm that critical incidents affect user satisfaction concerning safety, the latter constituting one of the most critical factors impacting user reuse intention and overal l satisfaction . The testtrack scenario also affects reuse intention, with university campuses and parks recording better outcomes than city centres and pedestrianized zones. In contrast to outcomes reported for conventional bus systems, higher socioeconomic status is associated with higher levels of satisfaction with driverless vehicles and a stronger reuse intention. Female users ar e reluctant to ride on driverless buses alone; however, when they are not regular bus users, they express a reluctance to board SAV both without transit support personnel and alone. In high-income municipalities, we find a positive impact on reuse intention. Finally, a higher degree of satisfaction with the regular bus system is positively linked with a better perceived driverless bus experience. For implementation purposes, location, critical incidents, safety, regular bus user satisfaction, technology affinity, and the income level of the municipalities are a l l aspects that need to be factoredin when designing an adoption strategy.

Through narrative analysis, interviews with stakeholders, and Futures Making Ateliers, this citizen engagement journey deconstructs the technological promises of CAVs, as well as their plausibility and desirability from the point of view of the participants of the participatory journey. Our findings suggest that the technology is solving a different problem than the mobility problem as articulated in policy documents. By investigating the matters of concern of participants, the problem of mobility was redefined in their own terms, and alternative futures were explored. We use the concept of MacGuffin as means to explore the wider relevance of CAVs in mobility futures.

AB In this work, we study the current coupled to a simplified Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) model using a dual computational and experimental approach. The simplified surrogate structure reduced the computational burden and facilitated the experimental measurement of the coupled currents. For a practical system, a wide range of simulations and measurements must be performed to analyze the induced current variations with respect to properties of the incident excitation waveform, such as the frequency, angle of incidence, and polarization. To simplify this analysis, Characteristic Mode Analysis (CMA) was used to compute the eigen-currents of the UAV model and predict where and under which RF excitation conditions the coupled current is maximized. We verified these predictions using direct experimental measurement of the coupled currents. The presented simulations and measurements show the usefulness of CMA for studying electromagnetic coupling to practical systems.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are nowadays largely employed in civil applications. One of the most promising applications is the environmental monitoring (or risk assessment). We propose a battery-powered eNose board that can be embedded with any type of drone. We evaluated the effectiveness of the sensing method by means of field experiments using the prototype as payload of a hexacopter. The results show that the analysis of the target environmental parameters is not perturbed by the air flow generated by propellers. The system is suitable for any type of mobile carrier (UAVs or wheeled robots), thanks to its lightweight and compact form factor. To further extend the limited flight autonomy of the carrier, we developed an optimal monitoring algorithm for gas leakage localization, a simulating framework to evaluate its performance, and we provide a design space exploration for solar-powered drones.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
AB In this brief, we consider the problem of 3-D path generation and tracking for unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). The proposed path generation algorithm allows us to find a path satisfying arbitrary initial and final conditions, specified in terms of position and velocity. Our method assumes that aircraft structural and dynamic limitations can be translated in a turn radius constraint; therefore, the generated paths satisfy a constraint on the minimum admissible turning radius. The proposed algorithm for the path tracking guarantees, under specified assumptions, that the tracking error, both in position and in attitude, asymptotically tends to zero. The work has been carried out with reference to the UAV of the Italian Aerospace Research Center (CIRA). Simulation results for both the path generation and the tracking algorithms are presented; the latter have been obtained using a detailed 6-degree-of-freedom model of the CIRA UAV in the presence of wind and turbulence.

AB A Small Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Nnavigation System (SANS) is being developed at the Naval Postgraduate School. The SANS is an integrated Global Positioning System/Inertial Navigation System (GPS/INS) navigation system composed of low-cost and small-size components. It is designed to demonstrate the feasibility of using a low-cost strap-down inertial measurement unit (IMU) to navigate between intermittent GPS fixes. The present hardware consists of a GPS/DGPS receiver, IMU, compass, water speed sensor, water depth sensor, and a data processing computer, The software is based on a 12-state complementary filter that combines measurement data from all sensors to derive a vehicle position/orientation estimate. This paper describes hardware and software design and testing results of the SANS. It is shown that results from tilt table testing and bench testing provide an effective means for tuning filter gains. Ground vehicle testing verifies the overall functioning of the SANS and exhibits an encouraging degree of accuracy.

AB An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has shown impressive potential and promising exploitation prospects in numerous marine missions. Among its various applications, the most essential prerequisite is path planning. Although considerable endeavors have been made, there are several limitations. A complete and realistic ocean simulation environment is critically needed. As most of the existing methods are based on mathematical models, they suffer from a large gap with reality. At the same time, the dynamic and unknown environment places high demands on robustness and generalization. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose an information-assisted reinforcement learning path planning scheme. First, it performs numerical modeling based on real ocean current observations to establish a complete simulation environment with the grid method, including 3-D terrain, dynamic currents, local information, and so on. Next, we propose an information compression (IC) scheme to trim the mutual information (MI) between reinforcement learning neural network layers to improve generalization. A proof based on information theory provides solid support for this. Moreover, for the dynamic characteristics of the marine environment, we elaborately design a confidence evaluator (CE), which evaluates the correlation between two adjacent frames of ocean currents to provide confidence for the action. The performance of our method has been evaluated and proven by numerical results, which demonstrate a fair sensitivity to ocean currents and high robustness and generalization to cope with the dynamic and unknown underwater environment.

AB It is essential to maximize capacity while satisfying the transmission time delay of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm communication system. In order to address this challenge, a dynamic decentralized optimization mechanism is presented for the realization of joint spectrum and power (JSAP) resource allocation based on deep Q-learning networks (DQNs). Each UAV to UAV (U2U) link is regarded as an agent that is capable of identifying the optimal spectrum and power to communicate with one another. The convolutional neural network, target network, and experience replay are adopted while training. The findings of the simulation indicate that the proposed method has the potential to improve both communication capacity and probability of successful data transmission when compared with random centralized assignment and multichannel access methods.

AB This paper describes a practical and reliable algorithm for implementing an Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS). This kind of system is essential for real time vehicle navigation, guidance and control applications. When low cost sensors are used, efficient and robust algorithms are required for performance to be acceptable. The proposed method is based on an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in a direct configuration. In this case, the filter is explicitly derived from both the kinematic and error models. The selection of this kind of EKF configuration can help in ensuring a tight integration of the method for its use in filter-based localization and mapping systems in autonomous vehicles. Experiments with real data show that the proposed method is able to maintain an accurate and drift-free attitude and heading estimation. An additional result is to show that there is no ostensible reason for preferring that the filter have an indirect configuration over a direct configuration for implementing an AHRS system.

The Turkish Air Force Academy personnel together with a team of cadets have been working on the design and development of an autonomous Quadrotor vehicle for educational purposes. The main emphasis was to study the flight dynamics of such a vehicle but the development of on-board electronics that consists of a sensor payload, embedded computer, and other hardware, along with the embedded software was such a critical work package under the project that required special emphasis and an innovative approach. A new avionic architecture that is derived from the rationale of Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) architecture of today's larger platforms is proposed and currently being implemented within the framework of our project. The advantages of this approach for the development of mini/micro UAVs along with the academic education of our cadets will be discussed.

AB This paper studies the convergence of two coordination algorithms for double-integrator dynamics under fixed undirected/directed interaction in a sampled-data setting. The first algorithm guarantees that a team of vehicles achieves coordination on their positions with a zero final velocity while the second algorithm guarantees that a team of vehicles achieves coordination on their positions with a constant final velocity. We show necessary and sufficient conditions on the sampling period, the control gain, and the communication graph such that coordination is achieved using these two algorithms under, respectively, an undirected interaction topology and a directed interaction topology. Tools like matrix theory, bilinear transformation, and Cauchy theorem are used for convergence analysis. Coordination equilibria for both algorithms are also given. Simulation results are presented as a proof of concept. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID TRACKING
AB An Otsu-threshold- and Canny-edge-detection-based fast Hough transform (FHT) approach to lane detection was proposed to improve the accuracy of lane detection for autonomous vehicle driving. During the last two decades, autonomous vehicles have become very popular, and it is constructive to avoid traffic accidents due to human mistakes. The new generation needs automatic vehicle intelligence. One of the essential functions of a cutting-edge automobile system is lane detection. This study recommended the idea of lane detection through improved (extended) Canny edge detection using a fast Hough transform. The Gaussian blur filter was used to smooth out the image and reduce noise, which could help to improve the edge detection accuracy. An edge detection operator known as the Sobel operator calculated the gradient of the image intensity to identify edges in an image using a convolutional kernel. These techniques were applied in the initial lane detection module to enhance the characteristics of the road lanes, making it easier to detect them in the image. The Hough transform was then used to identify the routes based on the mathematical relationship between the lanes and the vehicle. It did this by converting the image into a polar coordinate system and looking for lines within a specific range of contrasting points. This allowed the algorithm to distinguish between the lanes and other features in the image. After this, the Hough transform was used for lane detection, making it possible to distinguish between left and right lane marking detection extraction; the region of interest (ROI) must be extracted for traditional approaches to work effectively and easily. The proposed methodology was tested on several image sequences. The least-squares fitting in this region was then used to track the lane. The proposed system demonstrated high lane detection in experiments, demonstrating that the identification method performed well regarding reasoning speed and identification accuracy, which considered both accuracy and real-time processing and could satisfy the requirements of lane recognition for lightweight automatic driving systems.

AB In order to realize safe and accurate homing of a powered parafoil under the condition of insufficient initial altitude, a multiphase homing path is designed according to the flight characteristics of the vehicle. With consideration that the traditional control methods cannot ensure the quality of path following because of the nonlinear, large inertial and longtime delay existed in the system and strong disturbances in a complex environment, a homing controller, composed of the vertical and horizontal trajectory tracking controllers, is designed based on active disturbance rejection control (ADRC). Then autonomous homing simulation experiment of the powered parafoil with insufficient altitude is carried on in a windy environment. The simulation results show that the planned multiphase homing trajectory can fulfill the requirements of fixed-point homing and flare landing; the designed homing controller can overcome the influences of uncertain items of the internal and external disturbances, track the desired homing path more rapidly and steadily, and possesses better control performances than traditional PID controllers.

AB This paper reports the development and deployment of a synchronous clock acoustic navigation system suitable for the simultaneous navigation of multiple underwater vehicles Our navigation system is composed of an acoustic modem based communication and navigation system that allows for onboard navigational data to be broadcast as a data packet by a source node and for all passively receiving nodes to be able to decode the data packet to obtain a one-way-travel time (OWTT) pseudo range measurement and navigational ephemeris data The navigation method reported herein uses a surface ship acting as a single moving reference beacon to a fleet of passively listening underwater vehicles All vehicles within acoustic range are able to concurrently measure their slant range to the reference beacon using the OWTT measurement methodology and additionally receive transmission of reference beacon position using the modem data packet The advantages of this type of navigation system are that it can (i) concurrently navigate multiple underwater vehicles within the vicinity of the surface ship and (ii) provide a bounded error XY position measure that is commensurate with conventional moored long-baseline (LBL) navigation systems [i e, P(1 m)] but unlike LBL is not geographically restricted to a fixed-beacon network We present results for two different field experiments using a two-node configuration consisting of a global positioning system-equipped surface ship acting as a global navigation aid to a Doppler-aided autonomous underwater vehicle In each experiment vehicle position was independently corroborated by other standard navigation means Results for a maximum likelihood sensor fusion framework are reported (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals Inc

AB In this paper, we model and simulate special use cases of on-demand shared mobility services for the City of Ann Arbor, MI. We define shared mobility as any motor-vehicle-served transportation option between private vehicles and public transit, such as taxis, demand-responsive transit, and dynamic shuttles. Here, we present and evaluate a suite of four different service types that could potentially complement existing transportation services in Ann Arbor. A novel aspect of this study is that it tests scenarios that were developed in consultation with city planners looking for insights into real-world problems. This study used fleet simulation software to test four service configuration scenarios for a hypothetical on-demand shared mobility service: citywide shuttle, a corridor-based downtown shuttle, a park and ride shuttle, and a transit-complementary service. Three levels of demand were tested for each scenario: 3%, 9%, and 15% of all private vehicle trips in the city. Findings indicated that citywide on-demand shared mobility services struggled to achieve higher vehicle occupancies than private vehicles at approximately 1.4. Service configurations with aggregated trip density resulted in slightly improved occupancies, as found in downtown- and park and ride shuttle scenarios. More impactful was aggregating demand by moving from "many-to-many" routing as with citywide floating services to "many-to-one" routing as with downtown- or park and ride shuttle services, which increased vehicle occupancy from 1.4 to almost 2. Lastly, we also discuss the potential bene?ts of reduced congestion and parking needs.

AB Classical approaches for testing of automated driving systems (ADS) of SAE levels 1 and 2 were based on defined scenarios with specific maneuvers, depending on the function under test. For ADS of SAE level 3+, the scenario space is infinite and calling for virtual testing and verification. The biggest challenge for virtual testing methods lies in the realistic representation of the virtual environment where the ADS is tested. Such an environment shall provide the possibility to model and develop vehicles, objects, control algorithms, traffic participants and environment elements in order to generate valid and representative test data. An important and crucial aspect of such environments is the testing of vehicles in a complex traffic environment with a stochastic and realistic traffic representation. For this research we used a microscopic traffic flow simulation software (TFSS) PTV Vissim and the vehicle simulation software IPG CarMaker to test ADS. Although the TFSS provides realistic and stochastic behavior of traffic participants, the occurrence of safety-critical scenarios (SCS) is not guaranteed. To generate and increase such scenarios, a novel stress testing method (STM) is introduced. With this method, traffic participants are manipulated in the vicinity of the vehicle under test in order to provoke SCS derived from statistical accident data on motorways in Austria. Using the co-simulation between IPG CarMaker, PTV Vissim and external driver models in Vissim are used to imitate human driving errors, resulting in an increase of SCS.

AB In this article, we address the problem of aerial transport of a suspended payload by two vehicles with minimal sensing and computational requirements. Herein, the leader-follower paradigm is adopted, allowing the follower robot to estimate and stabilize the formation using only feedback from its onboard inertial sensor. This is achieved through an analysis of the underlying dynamics of the coupled system. The gained insights lead to the introduction of a two-stage Kalman-based estimation strategy and the linear control laws that are capable of robustly dealing with the underactuated leader-payload-follower system. The vision-less methods have been verified through a series of flight experiments. The efficiency and the robustness of the schemes enable the cooperative payload transport to be accomplished by two sub-100-g robots with highly limited computational power in both indoor and outdoor environments.

AB A vertical takeoff and landing, unmanned aerial vehicle is presented that features a quadrotor design for propulsion and attitude stabilization, and an annular wing that provides lift in forward flight. The annular wing enhances human safety by enshrouding the propeller blades. Both the annular wing and the propulsion units are fully characterized in forward flight via wind tunnel experiments. An autonomous control system is synthesized that is based on model inversion, and accounts for the aerodynamics of the wing. It also accounts for the dominant aerodynamics of the propellers in forward flight, specifically the thrust and rotor torques when subject to oblique flow conditions. The attitude controller employed is tilt-prioritized, as the aerodynamics are invariant to the twist angle of the vehicle. Outdoor experiments are performed, resulting in accurate tracking of the reference position trajectories at high speeds.

AB Innovative road signs that can autonomously display the speed limit in cases where the traffic situation requires it are under development. The autonomous road sign contains many types of sensors, of which the subject of interest in this article is the Doppler sensor that we have improved and the constructed and calibrated acoustic probe. An algorithm for performing vehicle detection and tracking, as well as vehicle speed measurement, in a signal acquired with a continuous wave Doppler sensor, is discussed. A method is also experimentally presented and studied for counting vehicles and for determining their movement direction by means of acoustic vector sensor application. The assumptions of the method employing spatial distribution of sound intensity determined with the help of an integrated three-dimensional (3D) sound intensity probe are discussed. The enhanced Doppler radar and the developed sound intensity probe were used for the experiments that are described and analyzed in the paper.

TI Two-Stage Road Terrain Identification Approach for Land Vehicles Using
   Feature-Based and Markov Random Field Algorithm
SO IEEE INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Road terrain identification is one of the important tasks for driving assistant systems or autonomous land vehicles. It plays a key role in improving driving strategy and enhancing fuel efficiency. In this paper, a two-stage approach using multiple sensors is presented. In the first stage, a feature-based identification approach is performed using an accelerometer, a camera, and downward-looking and forward-looking laser range finders (LRFs). This produces four classification label sequences. In the second stage, a majority vote is implemented for each label sequence to match it to synchronized road patches. Then a Markov Random Field (MRF) model is designed to generate the final optimized identification results to improve the forward-looking LRF. This approach enables the vehicle to observe the upcoming road terrain before moving onto it by fusing all the classification results using MRF algorithm. The experiments show this approach improved the terrain identification accuracy and robustness significantly for some familiar road terrains.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is achieving a leader-follower formation of unmanned aerial vehicles which is a cooperative scenario inspired by formation flying of living organisms such as geese. Designing a control strategy based on only vision measurement (without radio communication) and keeping connectivity in vision are important challenges in the formation flying problem which is the base of formation flying in living organisms.
   Design/methodology/approach - To achieve the mentioned purposes, a feedback linearization technique is used. Moreover, a Takagi-Sugeno-based supervisory control strategy for visibility maintenance combined with an acceleration estimator to compensate the leader maneuvers is proposed.
   Findings - The authors conclude that by using practical seeker sensors, all the mentioned objectives (under the proposed strategy) can be satisfied.
   Originality/value - Keeping formation and visibility maintenance in the presence of the leader maneuver are the main contributions of the paper.

AB Nowadays, with the purpose of fulfilling the increasing demands for emerging extensive and ubiquitous accessibility to modern intelligent transportation systems (ITS), the conventional vehicle-to-everything (V2X) paradigms are progressively evolving into the Internet of vehicles (IoVs). As of now, substantial enhancements in IoV technologies have been witnessed, particularly in the era of vehicular data secure exchange and user privacy protection. On the other hand, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned to provide scalable and adaptive stereoscopic service coverage for IoV implementations. However, the existing approaches intended for the common scenarios mainly rely on the well-established local IoV infrastructures, whereas the specific infrastructure-less IoVs with dysfunctional edge facilities have not been properly investigated. Additionally, the related UAV-assisted IoV schemes still fail to independently perform the secure vehicular data transmission but rather as the auxiliary strategies due to the dependence on the assistance of local edge deployment. Therefore, the practical requirements of reliability and scalability in real-world IoV circumstances cannot be satisfied. In this paper, an efficient UAV certificateless group authentication mechanism is developed in order to facilitate the secure data transmission of infrastructure-less IoV. The proposed design deploys the tethered UAV (TUAV) as the specific mobilized base station so that the active edge IoV infrastructure is not needed. The security analysis regarding the key security features are presented first, followed by the performance evaluation. According to the comparison results with the existing designs, improvements in terms of computational cost and communication overhead for different phases can be demonstrated.

ID TRACKING CONTROL
AB Safe and efficient autonomous lane changing is a key step of connected automated vehicles (CAVs), which can greatly reduce the traffic accident rate and relieve the traffic pressure. Aiming at the requirements of the smoothness and efficiency of the lane-changing trajectory of CAVs, it is necessary to design the lane changing controller to integrate the sensing, decision-making, and control tasks in the driving process. Firstly, based on the vehicle dynamics model, this paper proposes a vehicle lane-changing control strategy based on NNTSMC method (neural network enhanced non-singular fast terminal sliding mode control). The designed lane-changing controller can well realize the designed path tracking, and both lateral position and yaw angle can well track the expected value. This method enables the vehicle to control the front wheel steering angle intelligently, and the lateral acceleration during steering changes in the small scope, which ensures the steering stability of the vehicle. In this study, an improved adaptive RBF neural network with bounded mapping is designed to estimate the upper bound of the total disturbance of the system, which effectively reduces the chattering phenomenon of the control force. The Lyapunov function constructed in this study proves that the designed controller can ensure the stability of the controlled system. Finally, a comparative experiment is performed by the MATLAB/Simulink-CarSim co-simulation. Compared with SMC and TSMC (non-singular fast terminal sliding mode control), the proposed method has a performance improvement of at least 58.0% and 34.1%, respectively. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control method were confirmed by the experiments on the co-simulation platform.

AB Trajectory planning is one of the key technologies for autonomous driving. A* algorithm is a classical trajectory planning algorithm that has good results in the field of robot path planning. However, there are still some practical problems to be solved when the algorithm is applied to vehicles, such as the algorithm fails to consider the vehicle contours, the planned path is not smooth, and it lacks speed planning. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a path processing method and a path tracking method for the A* algorithm. First, the method of configuring safe redundancy space is given considering the vehicle contour, then, the path is generated based on A* algorithm and smoothed using Bessel curve, and the speed is planned based on the curvature of the path. The trajectory tracking algorithm in this paper is based on an expert system and pure tracking theory. In terms of speed tracking, an expert system for the acceleration characteristics of the vehicle is constructed and used as a priori information for speed control, and good results are obtained. In terms of path tracking, the required steering wheel angle is calculated based on pure tracking theory, and the influence factor of speed on steering is obtained from test data, based on which the steering wheel angle is corrected and the accuracy of path tracking is improved. In addition, this paper proposes a target point selection method for the pure tracking algorithm to improve the stability of vehicle directional control. Finally, a simulation analysis of the proposed method is performed. The results show that the method can improve the applicability of the A* algorithm in automated vehicle planning.

AB In this article, we focus on enabling the autonomous perception and control of a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for a facade inspection task. Specifically, we consider the perception as a planar object pose estimation problem by simplifying the building structure as a concatenation of planes, and the control as an optimal reference tracking control problem. First, a vision-based adaptive observer is proposed for plane pose estimation which converges fast and is insensitive to noise under very mild observation conditions. Second, a model predictive controller (MPC) is designed to achieve stable plane following and smooth transition in a multiple-plane scenario, while the persistent excitation (PE) condition of the observer and the maneuver constraints of the UAV are satisfied. The stability of the observer and the MPC controller is also investigated to ensure theoretical completeness. The proposed autonomous plane pose estimation and plane tracking methods are tested in both simulation and practical building facade inspection scenarios, which demonstrate their effectiveness and practicability.

AB Sidewalk autonomous delivery robots (SADRs) are a new last-mile delivery service. The present study aims to identify the factors impacting the adoption of SADRs among Iranian online shoppers. To this end, based on consumer coproduction theory and technology readiness (TR), this paper combined individual factors, socialized factor, and risk factors. A total of 287 respondents were surveyed using an online questionnaire, and the partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was employed to model the data. The modelling results revealed that attitude, innovativeness, and optimism had positive impacts on the intention of consumers to use delivery robots. Furthermore, optimism and environmental concern had a positive impact on attitude, while the need for human interaction, performance risk, and delivery risk had negative impacts. However, no significant relationship was found between innovativeness and attitude. The results of the present study provide important theoretical and practical suggestions to marketers and delivery service provides.

TI <i>Tutorial</i>: Monocular Visual Autonomous Landing System for
   Quadcopter Drones Using Software in the Loop
SO IEEE AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
ID AERIAL VEHICLE; UAV
AB Autonomous landing is a capability that is essential to achieve the full potential of multirotor drones in many social and industrial applications. The implementation and testing of this capability on physical platforms is risky and resource-intensive; hence, in order to ensure both a sound design process and a safe deployment, simulations are required before implementing a physical prototype. This article presents the development of a monocular visual system, using a software-in-the-loop methodology that autonomously and efficiently lands a quadcopter drone on a predefined landing pad, thus reducing the risks of the physical testing stage. In addition to ensuring that the autonomous landing system as a whole fulfils the design requirements using a Gazebo-based simulation, our approach provides a tool for safe parameter tuning and design testing prior to physical implementation. Finally, the proposed monocular vision-only approach to landing pad tracking made it possible to effectively implement the system in an F450 quadcopter drone with the standard computational capabilities of an Odroid XU4 embedded processor.

AB Application of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) in environments devoid of GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) service has motivated research into GNSS-independent navigation solutions. This paper presents an account of such solutions proposed within the last decade. Unlike most literature that abstract UAV navigation to mere localization, this work takes a bottom-up approach by assessing the navigation components namely perception, localization and motion planning presented in the selected literature. The review results indicate that only 16% of the research presented full navigation solutions, while the rest present one or several components thereof. Besides the account of navigation solutions, our other contributions include an adapted MTOW-based (Maximum Take-Off Weight) UAV classification scheme incorporating a nano-sized UAV class, technology maturity assessment of the reviewed GNSS-independent navigation solutions and analysis of integrity monitoring frameworks.

AB The rapid adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) has encouraged the integration of new connected devices such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to the ubiquitous network. UAVs promise a pragmatic solution to the limitations of existing terrestrial IoT infrastructure as well as bring new means of delivering IoT services through a wide range of applications. Owning to their potential, UAVs are expected to soon dominate the low-altitude airspace over populated cities. This introduces new research challenges such as the safe management of UAVs operation under high traffic demands. This paper proposes a novel way of structuring the uncontrolled, low-altitude airspace, with the aim of addressing the complex problem of UAV traffic management at an abstract level. The work, hence, introduces a model of the airspace as a weighted multilayer network of nodes and airways and presents a set of experimental simulation results using three UAV traffic management heuristics.

AB To promote the combat capability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the future battlefield, the autonomous aerial refueling (AAR) technology becomes a challenging research issue. An accurate position relationship between the tanker and the receiver is significant for AAR. A novel drogue detection method is presented in this paper. The Adaptive boosting (Adaboost) and the convolutional neural networks (CNN) classifier with the improved focal loss (IFL) function are utilized to detect the drogue in complex environments. The sample imbalance during the training stage of the CNN classifier is solved by the IFL function. The PyTorch deep learning framework is employed to implement the software system with the graphics processing units (GPUs). Real scenario images with a mimetic drogue on the tanker are captured for training and testing dataset by the airborne camera on the receiver. The experimental results indicate that the presented algorithm can accelerate the detection speed and improve the detection accuracy. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper describes the development of an autonomous chemical-sensing aerial robotic system for environmental monitoring in urban and suburban areas. The robot is equipped with a high-performance chemical sensor that identifies and quantifies chemical agents, enabling applications, such as chemical mapping, source localization, and estimation. To enable collision-free monitoring in areas with obstacles, such as in urban and suburban environments where buildings, trees, and other structures pose a challenge, a potential-field algorithm that incorporates past actions is used. A custom-designed ground station for controlling the robot, and planning and visualizing environmental data in real time is described. An empirical method is used to maximize the robot's flight time for improved effective operating range and to provide a safe operating standoff distance. Finally, two outdoor chemical dispersion experiments are conducted to demonstrate the capabilities of the autonomous airborne chemical-sensing system, where results show effective mapping of a propane gas leak.

AB Introduction: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are considered a promising solution to improve seniors' safety and mobility. However, to transition to fully automated transportation, especially among seniors, it is vital to assess their perception and attitude toward AVs. This paper investigates seniors' perceptions and attitudes to a wide range of AV options from the perspective of pedestrians and users in general, as well as during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Underlying this objective is to examine older pedes-trians' safety perceptions and behaviors at crosswalks in the presence of AVs. Method: A national survey collected data from a sample of 1,000 senior Americans. Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis, three clusters of seniors were identified with different demographic characteristics, per-ceptions, and attitudes toward AVs. Results: PCA findings revealed that "risky pedestrian crossing behav-ior," "cautious pedestrian crossing behavior in the presence of AVs," "positive perception and attitude toward shared AVs," and "demographic characteristics" were the main components explaining most of the variation within the data, respectively. The PCA factor scores were used in the cluster analysis, which resulted in the identification of three distinctive groups of seniors. Cluster one included individuals with lower demographic scores and a negative perception and attitude toward AVs from the perspective of users and pedestrians. Clusters two and three included individuals with higher demographic scores. Cluster two included individuals with a positive perception toward shared AVs from the user perspective, but a negative attitude toward pedestrian-AV interaction. Cluster three included those with a negative perception toward shared AVs but a somewhat positive attitude toward pedestrian-AV interaction. The findings of this study provide valuable insights to transportation authorities, AV manufacturers, and researchers regarding older American's perception and attitude toward AVs as well as their willingness to pay and use Advanced Vehicle Technologies.(c) 2022 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd.

AB Coastal zones are subjected to a wide range of phenomena acting on very different temporal and spatial scales: from decades to days and from hundreds of kilometers to tens of meters. Planning the management of such areas, thus, requires an accurate and updated knowledge of the ongoing processes. While standard monitoring activities are functional for the medium-long time scale and medium-large spatial scale, they struggle to provide adequate information concerning the short period (i.e., days) and small range (i.e., few meters). In addition, such operations are affected by high costs and logistic complexity since they generally involve the deployment of specific aircraft or maritime vehicles. On the contrary, the employment of robotic devices can represent a solution to these issues. Their proper use can allow for frequent surveys and enhance the coverage of the acquired data due to optimized mission strategies. Marine robotics has the potential to arise as an efficient complementary tool to standard monitoring techniques. Nevertheless, the use of marine robots is still limited and should be improved. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the current state of robotic technology, identifying both the benefits and shortcomings of its use for micro-tidal marine-coastal monitoring. The discussion will be supported by actual results, taken as an example, achieved using FeelHippo AUV, the compact Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) developed by the Department of Industrial Engineering at the University of Florence, Italy.

AB Human-automation cooperation has become ubiquitous. In this concept, automation refers to autonomous machines, robots, artificial intelligence, and other autonomous nonhuman agents. A human driver will share control of semiautonomous vehicles (semi-AVs) with an automated system and thus share responsibility for crashes caused by semi-AVs. Research has not clarified whether and why people would attribute different levels of blame and responsibility to automation (and its creators) and its human counterpart when each causes an equivalent crash. We conducted four experiments in two studies (total N = 1,045) to measure different responses (e.g., severity and acceptability judgment, blame and responsibility attribution, compensation judgment) to hypothetical crashes that are caused by the human or the automation in semi-AVs. The results provided previously unidentified evidence of a bias, which we called the "blame attribution asymmetry," a tendency that people will judge the automation-caused crash more harshly, ascribe more blame and responsibility to automation and its creators, and think the victim in this crash should be compensated more. This asymmetry arises in part because of the higher negative affect triggered by the automation-caused crash. This bias has a direct policy implication: a policy allowing "not-safe enough" semi-AVs on roads could backfire, because these AVs will lead to many traffic crashes, which might in turn produce greater psychological costs and deter more people from adopting them. Other theoretical and policy implications of our findings were also discussed.

ID VEHICLE-ROUTING PROBLEM; A-RIDE PROBLEM; SEARCH; TRANSPORTATION;
   OPTIMIZATION
AB Transportation services play a crucial part in the development of modern smart cities. In particular, on-demand ridesharing services, which group together passengers with similar itineraries, are already operating in several metropolitan areas. These services can be of significant social and environmental benefit, by reducing travel costs, road congestion and CO2 emissions. The deployment of autonomous cars in the near future will surely change the way people are traveling. It is even more promising for a ridesharing service, since it will be easier and cheaper for a company to handle a fleet of autonomous cars that can serve the demands of different passengers.
   We argue that user satisfaction should be the main objective when trying to find the best assignment of passengers to vehicles and the determination of their routes. Moreover, the model of user satisfaction should be rich enough to capture the traveling time, cost, and other factors as well. We show that it is more important to capture a rich model of human satisfaction than peruse an optimal performance. That is, we developed a practical algorithm for assigning passengers to vehicles, which outperforms brute-force assignment algorithms that use a simpler satisfaction model.
   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to exclusively concentrate on a rich and realistic general function of user satisfaction as the objective, which is (arguably) the most important aspect to consider for achieving a widespread adaption of ridesharing services.

AB Introduction: With the Safety Ensuring Lives Future Deployment and Research in Vehicle Evolution (SELF DRIVE) Act in the United States, there is a growing interest in autonomous vehicles (AVs). One avenue of innovation would be to use them to mobilize and coordinate response efforts during natural disasters. This study uses an earthquake response in an urban, developed setting as a hypothetical example case study. In this hypothetical scenario, private AVs would be mobilized to help rescue victims from collapsed structures. Methods: A Markov model compared an intervention arm with AVs to a status quo arm using a hypothetical cohort of American earthquake victims. The three possible health states were trapped but alive, rescued and alive, and dead. The cycle length of the Markov model was 6 h. Results: The cost of deploying AVs was $90,139 relative to $87,869 in status quo arm. Using AVs produced an incremental cost of $2269 (95% credible interval (CI) = $-12,985-$8959). Victims have 7.33 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in the intervention arm compared to 7.20 QALYs in the status quo arm, resulting in an incremental gain of 0.13 (95% CI = -0.73-2.19) QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $16,960/QALY gained (95% CI = cost-saving-$69,065/QALY). Discussion: The mobilization of private AVs in the setting of an earthquake has the potential to save money and reduce the loss of life. AVs may advance emergency management competencies.

AB Autonomous robots, especially aerial vehicles, when subject to disturbances, uncertainties, and noises may experience variations from their desired states and deviations from the planned trajectory which may lead them into an unsafe state (e.g., a collision). It is thus necessary to monitor their states at run-time when operating in uncertain and cluttered environments and intervene to guarantee their and the surrounding's safety. While Reachability Analysis (RA) has been successfully used to provide safety guarantees, it doesn't provide explanations on why a system is predicted to be unsafe and what type of corrective actions to perform to change the decision. In this work we propose a novel approach for run-time monitoring that leverages a library of previously observed trajectories together with decision tree theory to predict if the system will be safe/unsafe and provide an explanation to understand the causes of the prediction. We design an interpretable monitor that checks at run-time if the vehicle may become unsafe and plan safe corrective actions if found unsafe. For each prediction, we provide a logical explanation - a decision rule - that includes information about the causes that lead to the predicted safety decision. The explanation also includes a set of counterfactual rules that shows what system variables may bring the system to the opposite safety decision, if changed. We leverage such an explanation to plan corrective actions that always keep the vehicle safe. Our technique is validated both with simulations and experiments on a quadrotor UAV in cluttered environments under the effect of previously untrained disturbances.

AB Information fusion strategies for vehicles navigating while aiding their inertial navigation systems (INSs) with terrestrial signals of opportunity (SOPs) are developed and studied. The following problem is considered. Multiple navigating vehicles with access to global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals are aiding their on-board INSs with GNSS pseudoranges. While navigating, vehicle-mounted receivers draw pseudorange measurements from terrestrial SOPs (e.g., AM/FM radio, digital television, cellular) with unknown emitter positions and unknown and unsynchronized clocks. The vehicles share INS data and SOP pseudoranges to collaboratively estimate the SOPs' states through an extended Kalman filter using tight coupling. After some time, GNSS signals become unavailable, at which point the navigating vehicles use shared INS and SOP information to continue navigating in a collaborative inertial radio simultaneous localization and mapping (CIRSLAM) framework. This paper develops such CIRSLAM framework and synthesizes what SOP and INS information should be shared between collaborators. Two information fusion strategies are compared: 1) sharing time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements from SOPs; 2) sharing time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) measurements taken with reference to an SOP. Next, a strategy to efficiently share INS information along with SOP information is discussed. Monte Carlo simulation results are presented that support the analytical findings that vehicles navigating in a CIRSLAM framework, while sharing and fusing SOP TOA measurements, produce a smaller or equal estimation error covariance compared to fusing SOP TDOA measurements. Experimental results are presented demonstrating two unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) navigating in a CIRSLAM framework with SOP TOA measurements from terrestrial cellular towers. The final UAVs' localization error after 30 seconds of GPS unavailability were reduced compared to using an INS alone from around 55 m to around 6 m.

We apply automobility theory in a novel approach, by investigating consumer engagement with aspects of the automobility system related to car ownership and use in the case studies of Canada and Germany, while also considering openness to new mobility innovations. These countries differ in that Canada has higher levels of car ownership, commutes made by car, and urban sprawl, as well as lower levels of carsharing and electric vehicle adoption relative to Germany. We apply a conceptual framework and 40-item scale of consumer "automobility engagement" to representative survey samples of 3527 Canadian and 2620 German respondents. Exploratory factor analysis identifies five automobility engagement factors: "Driving Enjoyment", "Car Identity", "Car Dependence", "Societal Concern about Car Use", and "Sustainable Travel Norms". Mean scores are significantly higher for Canadian respondents on four factors, but not significantly different for "Driving Enjoyment". In regression analysis, these factors can help to explain consumer interest in carsharing, fully automated vehicles, and electric vehicles in both countries, where "Car Dependence" and "Societal Concern about Car Use" predict interest in fully automated and electric vehicles. Interactions reveal that some patterns differ by country; for example, "Societal Concern about Car Use" predicts carsharing interest among German respondents only. The similarities and differences in country results suggest that the framework can be useful in a variety of contexts.

ID DESIGN
AB Mobile and aerial robots offer many potential applications, including warehouse logistics, surveillance, cinematography, and search and rescue. However, most such robots are task-specific and generally lack the versatility to tackle multiple scenarios, terrains, and unstructured, dynamic environments. This paper presents the Omnirotor platform, a versatile, multi-modal, coaxial, tilt-rotor, all-terrain vehicle that combines an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) into a hybrid, all-terrain vehicle. The Omnirotor has two locomotion modes of operation (aerial and ground vehicle) and five operational configurations, as it can fly both in the Normal and Inverted configurations and drive on the ground in the Normal and Inverted configurations. It can also recover from any non-operational state to its Normal, upside-down configuration. Moreover, in addition to the locomotion modes, the continuous omnidirectional thrust vectoring enables the Omnirotor platform to perform complex manipulation of objects. This work introduces the concept and discusses in detail the design, development, and experimental validation of the Omnirotor platform. In particular, it discusses the modeling and control schemes required by the different operation modes and configurations. It experimentally validates the platform's capabilities with experiments focusing on traversing challenging environments and unstructured, uneven terrains (e.g., a public park). Finally, the platform's ground, pushing-based manipulation capabilities are demonstrated through the execution of a puzzle-solving experiment where the solved puzzle serves as a landing platform for the all-terrain vehicle. The versatility of the Omnirotor offers exciting prospects for use in challenging search-and-rescue scenarios, surveillance, and aerial and ground manipulation applications.

AB Introduction: There is currently a strong focus within the automotive industry centered on traffic safety, with topics such as distracted driving, accident avoidance technologies, and autonomous vehicles. These papers tend to focus on the possible improvements from a single factor. However, there are many factors that are present in each accident, and it is important to understand the influence of each factor on the relative accident risk in order to identify the most effective approaches for improving driver safety. Rear-end accidents tend to be the most common accident type with approximately 1.8 M cases, or 31% of all accidents, in 2012, according to NHTSA. Of the rear-end accident scenarios, approximately 18-23% occur on wet surfaces. Method: A Monte Carlo Forward Collision Simulation models the conditions of a wet rear-end accident and estimates the relative impact of various vehicle collision parameters. The model takes distributions of these parameters as inputs, and outputs a risk of collision relative to a known reference case. The parameters that can be studied include: tire grip level, road grip level, vehicle velocity, following distances, and the presence of vehicle technologies (ABS, FCW & AEB). Distributions of some of these parameters have been improved thanks to Naturalistic Driving Study data from SHRP2. Results: This study shows that these vehicle systems have a large impact on safety and can change the amount of influence attributed to other parameters such as tire grip levels. As the use of automated vehicle systems expands, so will the influence of tire grip performance levels on collision risks. (C) 2020 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes a joint neural network model to imitate lane-changing behaviors. Specifically, lane-changing decision-making process is captured by probabilistic neural network (PNN) and lane-changing decision-making process is learned by back-propagation neural network (BPNN). The link between the two neural networks is the target gap for lane-changing. After testing and calibrating the joint neural network model, simulation experiments are designed to study heterogeneous traffic flow at an off-ramp bottleneck. Numerical simulations are conducted in various traffic scenarios with different market penetration rates (MPRs) of intelligent vehicles (IVs) and proportions of exit vehicles. Finally, the performance of heterogeneous flows is evaluated from the perspectives of average speed, road capacity, and safety. The results show that joint neural network can accurately predict the gap types chosen for lane changes and vehicle trajectory during lane-changing. For the traffic system, road capacity obtains the least value when the MPR of IVs is 50%. Moreover, frequent lane-changing movements upstream the off-ramp bottleneck determine the areas at greatest risk. However, when MPR of IVs is over 80% or proportion of exit vehicles is below 15%, both traffic efficiency and safety can be significantly improved. This work provides some insights into the application of machine learning algorithms to traffic flow modeling, and conducts quantitative analysis on the impact of key parameters on traffic systems. Findings of this work can support management and operation of automated highway systems in the future.

ID DROGUE DETECTION; TRACKING; NAVIGATION
AB Autonomous aerial refueling (AAR) technology can increase the flight endurance of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) effectively. Drogue detection and target tracking method are significant for probe-drogue refueling system in the docking stage. This paper proposes a novel vision-based multistage image processing algorithm of drogue detection and target tracking for AAR. This algorithm divides the whole task into four stages: preprocessor, recognizer, predictor, and locker (PRPL). The adaptive threshold segmentation (ATS) algorithm and support vector machine (SVM) classifier are utilized in preprocessor and recognizer for drogue detection. An improved kernelized correlation filter (IKCF) tracking algorithm and scale adaptive method by window position as well as image resolution adjusted are adopted in predictor and locker for target tracking in complex dynamic environments. Finally, the proposed PRPL multistage image processing strategy is tested using an autonomous aerial refueling testbed. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves high precision, good reliability, and real-time capability compared with conventional algorithms. The average processing time is within 11 ms in various environments, which can meet the requirement for drogue detection and tracking in AAR.

ID ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; FLOW
AB Evaluating the economic benefits of traffic optimization from connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and relevant traffic organization methods is significant, which will help to put forward suggestions for policymakers to promote the application of CAVs. The impacts and related benefits from CAVs with level 2 automation (L2 CAVs) on traffic efficiency and energy consumption of expressways are analyzed in this paper. Average travel time and actual road capacity are on behalf of traffic efficiency while average electric energy consumption is used to compute traffic energy consumption. The corresponding traffic economic benefits consist of travel-time-saving benefits, road construction benefits, and energy-saving benefits. A benefit evaluation framework is newly proposed and microscopic traffic simulation software is applied as the experiment platform. Different market penetration rates of L2 CAVs and various traffic flow statuses are considered. Besides, dedicated lanes for CAVs are also involved in this research, which are regarded as a traffic organization method expected to promote the realization of CAV's traffic benefits. It is found that L2 CAVs can save the average travel time and reduce average energy consumption for a single vehicle in most scenes. However, negative impacts on energy consumption are observed in several scenes due to the increase of actual road capacity. Positive economic benefits are obtained as soon as the traffic flow rate is out of saturation, which become increasingly higher as CAV's market penetration rate turns larger. Additionally, amplification in traffic economic benefits appears only if CAV lanes are provided under proper conditions.

AB Within visual range air combat involves execution of highly complex and dynamic activities, requiring rapid, sequential decision-making to achieve success. Fighter pilots spend years perfecting tactics and maneuvers for these types of combat engagements, yet the ongoing emergence of unmanned, autonomous vehicle technologies elicits a natural question - can an autonomous unmanned combat aerial vehicle (AUCAV) be imbued with the necessary artificial intelligence to perform challenging air combat maneuvering tasks independently? We formulate and solve the air combat maneuvering problem (ACMP) to examine this important question, developing a Markov decision process (MDP) model to control a defending AUCAV seeking to destroy an attacking adversarial vehicle. The MDP model includes a 5-degree-of-freedom, point-mass aircraft state transition model to accurately represent both kinematics and energy while maneuvering. An approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approach is proposed wherein we develop and test an approximate policy iteration algorithm that implements value function approximation via neural network regression to attain high-quality maneuver policies for the AUCAV. A representative intercept scenario is specified for testing purposes wherein the AUCAV must engage and destroy an adversary aircraft attempting to penetrate the defended airspace. Several designed experiments are conducted to determine how aircraft velocity and adversary maneuvering tactics impact the efficacy of the proposed ADP solution approach and to enable efficient algorithm parameter tuning. ADP-generated policies are compared to two benchmark maneuver policies constructed from two reward shaping functions found in the ACMP literature, attaining improved mean probabilities of kill for 24 of 36 air combat situations considered

AB The asset assessment and condition monitoring of large-scale photovoltaic (PV) systems spanning over a large geographical area has imposed urgent challenges and demands for novel and efficient inspection paradigm. In this study, an automatic UAV-based inspection system is presented and implemented for asset assessment and defect detection for large-scale PV systems. Two typical visible defects of PV modules, snail trails and dust shading, are characterised and the defect detection through image processing algorithms based on first order derivative of Gaussian function and feature matching is carried out for the aerial PV module images captured by visible light cameras. The functionality of the developed unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based inspection system can be easily extended with more advanced fault detection algorithms and different forms of sensing devices (e.g. infrared thermal camera) for specialised inspection tasks. Such UAV-based imaging can carry out a variety of inspection and condition monitoring tasks in PV systems spanning over a large geographical area in an autonomous or supervised fashion with significantly promoted efficiency in comparison with conventional methods.

AB Path tracking has a significant impact on the success of long-term autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) missions in terms of safety, energy-saving, and efficiency. However, it is a challenging problem due to the model uncertainty, and ocean current disturbance. Moreover, the widely used line of sight (LOS) algorithm with fixed lookahead distance does not perform well because it requires an urgent need for the automatic adjustment of the parameter. Considering the above, this study proposes an adaptive line-of-sight (ALOS) guidance method with reinforcement learning (RL) based on the dynamic data-driven AUV model (DDDAM). Firstly, we introduced a detailed AUV dynamic model mainly including the models with and without current influence. Next, we conducted a detailed analysis of the path tracking error dynamics and the factors influencing the tracking performance based on the model proposed above. We then used the DDDAM (using long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network) to pre-train the RL framework to generate more samples for online learning in order to speed up the learning process. Finally, the deterministic policy gradient (DPG) based RL was designed to optimize the continuously varying lookahead distance considering the previously analyzed factors. Collectively, this paper presents simulation cases and an evaluation of the algorithm. Our results indicate that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of path tracking with effectiveness and robustness.

AB The detection of objects on the seafloor is a complex task. The domain of the detection and classification of naval mines is additionally complicated by the high risk nature of the task. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have been used in naval mine countermeasures (MCM) operations to search large areas using sensors such as sidescan or synthetic aperture sonars. These sensors generally have a high coverage rate, while sacrificing spatial resolution. Conversely, sensors with higher resolution but lower coverage (such as forward-looking sonars and electro-optical cameras) are employed for the later classification and identification stages of the MCM mission. However, to autonomously execute a target reacquisition mission, it is important to be able to collect and process data automatically and, in near real time, onboard an AUV. For this purpose, an automatic target recognition (ATR) system is required. This article proposes an ATR, which can be used onboard an autonomous vehicle, capable of detecting mine-like objects in forward-looking sonar data. The ATR combines a detector and a classifier, based on convolutional neural network models, with a probabilistic grid map that filters out false positives and combines reported detections at nearby locations. A strategy, combining a survey pattern with target-mapping maneuvers automatically activated by the ATR, has been designed to maximize the performance of this ATR. The whole system has been tested in simulation as well as using data from previous MCM exercises, the results of which are presented here.

AB By bringing the computation and storage resources close proximity to the mobile network edge, mobile edge computing (MEC) is a key enabling technology for satisfying the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) infotainment applications' requirements, e.g., video streaming service (VSA). However, the explosive growth of mobile video traffic brings challenges for video streaming providers (VSPs). One known issue is that a huge traffic burden on the vehicular network leads to increasing VSP costs for providing VSA to mobile users (i.e., autonomous vehicles). To address this issue, an efficient resource sharing scheme between underutilized vehicular resources is a promising solution to reduce the cost of serving VSA in the vehicular network. Therefore, we propose a new VSA model based on the lower cost of obtaining data from vehicles and then minimize the VSP's cost. By using existing data resources from nearby vehicles, our proposal can reduce the cost of providing video service to mobile users. Specifically, we formulate our problem as mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINP) in order to calculate the total payment of the VSP. In addition, we introduce an incentive mechanism to encourage users to rent its resources. Our solution represents a strategy to optimize the VSP serving cost under the quality of service (QoS) requirements. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed mechanism is possible to achieve up to 21% and 11% cost-savings in terms of the request arrival rate and vehicle speed, in comparison with other existing schemes, respectively.

TI Enhancing Intersection Traffic Safety Utilizing V2I Communications:

SO IEEE ACCESS

DE Intersection traffic safety; traffic collision avoidance; V2I
   communications; penetration rate; machine learning
ID SYSTEM
AB In recent years, improving intersection traffic safety has become a major focus for researchers. However, it remains a significant concern due to the increasing number of vehicles and the introduction of autonomous and cooperative driving systems. Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies offer promising solutions to reduce collisions between vehicles. As V2X technologies are slowly being integrated into traffic safety systems, questions arise about their impact on safety effectiveness. This research area is relatively unexplored but has potential to enhance intersection safety. In this paper, we introduce the Intersection Traffic Safety Framework (ITSF), a safety-oriented system devised to mitigate collisions at road intersections. This framework achieves this through the implementation of a collision avoidance mechanism that harnesses vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. Additionally, it incorporates a machine learning model tasked with distinguishing between vehicles posing a risk and those that do not, as part of the collision avoidance process. Furthermore, this work assesses the performance of this framework by considering critical factors like the penetration rate of V2X-enabled vehicles, end-to-end latency, and the responsiveness of drivers to safety alerts. The proposed approach proves highly effective in ensuring road users' safety with a penetration rate of 60% or higher, resulting in a significant reduction in collisions and nearly 98% accuracy in classifying risky vehicles. Additionally, the algorithm remains successful even when some drivers neglect warnings, showcasing its robustness in minimizing collision rates.

AB The development and research carried out in this paper, delves into the area of electric mobility (E-Mobility) conversion and the scepticism, doubts on utilising electric vehicles for large scale transportation and per-sonal use. Based on the problem domain outlined by the scrutiny of the existing literature, a prototype E-Mobility Advisor has been developed, and it is demonstrated through data analysis, machine learning and route planning. How a user can observe and how an electric vehicle is much cheaper to run than a traditional fuel-based vehicle is demonstrated by collating user driving data and quantifying this data. It demonstrates how much an alternative electric vehicle can cost for the same journey com-pleted by the user's fuel vehicle, also demonstrating which locations they have visited obtaining this driving data. Additionally, machine learning is utilised to analyse the current data set trend and make predictions for a week's time in how many miles a user will complete, and the costs associ-ated to this. The executions of this software proved to be successful with the analysis completed within the results section, where user feedback was collated on the system as a whole, as well as justifying the costs and predictions formed through the automatic data analysis and calculations. A thorough analysis has been completed outlining the successful ele-ments of the developed prototypes operation, as well as outlining where the project could be extended and how it would operate and be used within an industry environment.

TI A Peak-Capture Algorithm Used on an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle in the
   2010 Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill Response Scientific Survey
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB During the Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill Response Scientific Survey on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Ship Gordon Gunter Cruise GU-10-02 (27 May-4 June 2010), a Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) was deployed to make high-resolution surveys of the water column in targeted areas. There were 10 2-liter samplers on the AUV for acquiring water samples. An essential challenge was how to autonomously trigger the samplers when peak hydrocarbon signals were detected. In ship hydrocasts (measurements by lowered instruments) at a site to the southwest of the Deepwater Horizon wellhead, the hydrocarbon signal showed a sharp peak between 1,100- and 1,200-m depths, suggesting the existence of a horizontally oriented subsurface hydrocarbon plume. In response to this finding, we deployed the AUV at this site to make high-resolution surveys and acquire water samples. To autonomously trigger the samplers at peak hydrocarbon signals, we modified an algorithm that was previously developed for capturing peaks in a biological thin layer. The modified algorithm still uses the AUV's sawtooth (i.e., yo-yo) trajectory in the vertical dimension and takes advantage of the fact that in one yo-yo cycle, the vehicle crosses the horizontal plume (i.e., the strong-signal layer) twice. On the first crossing, the vehicle detects the peak and logs the corresponding depth (after correcting for the detection delay). On the second crossing, a sampling is triggered when the vehicle reaches the depth logged on the first crossing, based on the assumption that the depth of the horizontal oil layer does not vary much between two successive crossings that are no more than several hundred meters apart. In this paper, we present the algorithm and its performance in an AUV mission on 3 June 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, we present an improvement to the algorithm and the corresponding results from postprocessing the AUV mission data. Published 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.*

AB Modeling uncertainties are a major concern in vehicle path tracking control. As a practical engineering system, the uncertainties in vehicle lateral dynamics can be time-varying while bounded and have certain distributions wherein. The fuzzy set theory can effectively describe system uncertainties in terms of boundary and distribution. Contrary to fuzzy logic-based approaches, this article puts forward an explicit multiparameter optimal robust control law to ensure the uniform boundedness and ultimate uniform boundedness of the closed-loop path tracking dynamical system. Then, the tracking performance as well as the control cost is quantified as cost functions using fuzzy set theories. Finally, an optimization problem is established in the content of cooperative game to seek the optimal values for the tunable parameters. Simulations are conducted using CarSim and Simulink under double lane change and serpentine driving conditions. The results show that the proposed robust optimal control exhibits superior tracking performance.

AB In this paper, we present a game-theoretic model, a new algorithmic framework with convergence theory, and numerical examples for the solution of intersection management problems. In our model, we consider autonomous vehicles that can communicate with each other in order to find individual optimal driving strategies through an intersection, without colliding with other vehicles. This results in coupled optimal control problems and we consider a generalized Nash equilibrium reformulation of the problem. Herein, we have individual differential equations, state and control constraints and additionally nonconvex shared constraints. To handle the nonconvexity we consider a partial penalty approach. To solve the resulting standard Nash equilibrium problem, we propose a decomposition method, where the selection of the players is controlled through penalty terms. The proposed method allows the prevention of a priori introduced hierarchies. Using dynamic programming, we prove convergence of our algorithm. Finally, we present numerical studies that show the effectiveness of the approach.

AB This paper proposes a new efficient path-planning algorithm for articulated steering vehicles operating in semi-structured environments, in which obstacles are detected online by the vehicle's sensors. The first step of the algorithm is offline and computes a finite set of feasible motions that connect discrete robot states to construct a search space. The motion primitives are parameterized using Bezier curves and optimized as a nonlinear programming problem (NLP) equivalent to the constrained path planning problem. Applying the A* search algorithm to the search space produces the shortest paths as a sequence of these primitives. The sequence is drivable and suboptimal, but it can cause unnatural swerves. Therefore, online path smoothing, which uses a gradient-based method, is applied to solve another NLP. Numerical simulations demonstrate that performance of the proposed algorithm is significantly better than that of existing methods when determining constrained path optimization. Moreover, field experimental results demonstrate the successful generation of fast and safe trajectories for real-time autonomous driving.

AB In this paper we explore learning-based predictive cruise control and the impact of this technology on increasing fuel efficiency for commercial trucks. Traditional cruise control is wasteful when maintaining a constant velocity over rolling hills. Predictive cruise control (PCC) is able to look ahead at future road conditions and solve for a cost-effective course of action. Model- based controllers have been implemented in this field but cannot accommodate many complexities of a dynamic environment which includes changing road and vehicle conditions. In this work, we focus on incorporating a learner into an already successful model- based predictive cruise controller in order to improve its performance. We explore back propagating neural networks to predict future errors then take actions to prevent said errors from occurring. The results show that this approach improves the model based PCC by up to 60% under certain conditions. In addition, we explore the benefits of classifier ensembles to further improve the gains due to intelligent cruise control.

AB With the continuous development of society, the universal applicability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has gradually emerged, because the facilities, such as surveillance cameras, lifting ropes and manipulators that can be modified are widely used in various fields, and are engaged in various dangerous work beyond the reach of human resources. It is not hard to imagine that in the near future, UAVs would inevitably join in more complex tasks. While UAVs have unique advantages, they also need to pay more attention to maintenance and care to ensure the stability of UAVs in the process of performing tasks and avoid the occurrence of a crash caused by imbalance. For this reason, this paper would set up an automatic balance control method based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm to study the balance of UAVs with manipulators. Through comparative study with the balance method based on deep learning algorithm, it was found that the method based on AI algorithm can help UAVs better maintain balance. The detection accuracy of the method studied in this paper for UAV flight balance stability was above 96%, and the detection accuracy of UAV automatic balance stability based on deep learning algorithm was below 92%. At the same time, in the face of different influencing factors, the UAV based on artificial intelligence algorithm can also maintain the balance of flight faster and maintain the stability of landing and development flight. Therefore, the research in this paper is meaningful.

ID AUTONOMOUS EXPLORATION; TASK ASSIGNMENT
AB Exploration is an important aspect of autonomous robotics, whether it is for target searching, rescue missions, or reconnaissance in an unknown environment. In this paper, we propose a solution to efficiently explore the unknown environment by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Innovatively, a topological road map is incrementally built based on Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) and maintained along with the whole exploration process. The topological structure can provide a set of waypoints for searching an optimal informative path. To evaluate the path, we consider the information measurement based on prior map uncertainty and the distance cost of the path, and formulate a normalized utility to describe information-richness along the path. The informative path is determined in every period by a local planner, and the robot executes the planned path to collect measurements of the unknown environment and restructure a map. The proposed framework and its composed modules are verified in two 3-D environments, which exhibit better performance in improving the exploration efficiency than other methods.

AB This paper presents an onboard autonomous mission re-planning system for Multi-Satellites System (MSS) to perform onboard re-planing in disruptive situations. The proposed re-planning system can deal with different potential emergency situations. This paper uses Multi-Objective Hybrid Dynamic Mutation Genetic Algorithm (MO-HDM GA) combined with re-planning techniques as the core algorithm. The Cyclically Re-planning Method (CRM) and the Near Real-time Re-planning Method (NRRM) are developed to meet different mission requirements. Simulations results show that both methods can provide feasible re-planning sequences under unforeseen situations. The comparisons illustrate that using the CRM is average 20% faster than the NRRM on computation time. However, by using the NRRM more raw data can be observed and transmitted than using the CRM within the same period. The usability of this onboard re-planning system is not limited to multi-satellite system. Other mission planning and re-planning problems related to autonomous multiple vehicles with similar demands are also applicable.

AB This study investigates the morning commute problem in a single corridor with a bottleneck under a fully automated vehicle environment. By extending Vickrey's bottleneck model, we formulate the joint decisions on departure time and parking choices of morning commuters who make trade-offs among travel cost, the cost associated with parking, and the cost of tradable credits. To alleviate traffic congestion and improve social welfare, we propose a time-varying tradable credit scheme and integrate it with the morning commute problem. We explore the travel patterns and the optimal design of tradable credit schemes for the morning commute problem with homogeneous and heterogeneous commuters, respectively. For the homogeneous case, we derive the conditions on the tradable credit scheme to ensure the existence of equilibrium. The system-wide travel cost decreases with parking density after tradable credits are incorporated. Additionally, the efficiency of the tradable credits scheme can be improved by increasing the rate of credit charge rate. For the heterogeneous case, we propose an initial distribution strategy and combine it with the optimal tradable credit in order to guarantee social equity. The commuters with a low value of time (VOT) should be allocated more credits and the commuters with high VOT should be charged more credits. For both cases at system optimum, we find that the equilibrium price of tradable credits increases with parking density and decreases with the total amount of tradable credits.

TI Autonomous Vehicles' Car-Following Drivability Evaluation Based on
   Driving Behavior Spectrum Reference Model
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID COLLISION
AB A large portion of the accidents involving autonomous vehicles (AVs) are not caused by the functionality of AV, but rather because of human intervention, since AVs' driving behavior was not properly understood by human drivers. Such misunderstanding leads to dangerous situations during interaction between AV and human-driven vehicle (HV). However, few researches considered HV-AV interaction safety in AV safety evaluation processes. One of the solutions is to let AV mimic a normal HV's driving behavior so as to avoid misunderstanding to the most extent. Therefore, to evaluate the differences of driving behaviors between existing AV and HV is necessary. DRIVABILITY is defined in this study to characterize the similarity between AV's driving behaviors and expected behaviors by human drivers. A driving behavior spectrum reference model built based on human drivers' behaviors is proposed to evaluate AVs' car-following drivability. The indicator of the desired reaction time (DRT) is proposed to characterize the car-following drivability. Relative entropy between the DRT distribution of AV and that of the entire human driver population are used to quantify the differences between driving behaviors. A human driver behavior spectrum was configured based on naturalistic driving data by human drivers collected in Shanghai, China. It is observed in the numerical test that amongst all three types of preset AVs in the well-received simulation package VTD, the brisk AV emulates a normal human driver to the most extent (ranking at 55th percentile), while the default AV and the comfortable AV rank at 35th and 8th percentile, respectively.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
AB Path planning and motion control are fundamental components to realize safe and reliable autonomous driving. The discrimination of the role of these two components, however, is somewhat obscure because of strong mathematical interaction between these two components. This often results in a redundant computation in the implementation. One of attracting idea to overcome this redundancy is a simultaneous path planning and motion control (SPPMC) based on a model predictive control framework. SPPMC finds the optimal control input considering not only the vehicle dynamics but also the various constraints which reflect the physical limitations, safety constraints and so on to achieve the goal of a given behavior. In driving in the real traffic environment, decision making has also strong interaction with planning and control. This is much more emphasized in the case that several tasks are switched in some context to realize higher-level tasks. This paper presents a basic idea to integrate decision making, path planning and motion control which is able to be executed in realtime. In particular, lane-changing behavior together with the decision of its initiation is selected as the target task. The proposed idea is based on the nonlinear model predictive control and appropriate switching of the cost function and constraints in it. As the result, the decision of the initiation, planning, and control of the lane-changing behavior are achieved by solving a single optimization problem under several constraints such as safety. The validity of the proposed method is tested by using a vehicle simulator.

AB In recent years, as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have been widely used to prolong the lifetime of underwater acoustic sensor networks (UWASNs) through cooperative data-gathering with sensor nodes, the need for long-range AUVs has become more pronounced to support long-duration cooperation with sensor nodes. Hence, AUV-based data-gathering protocols are required to support the long-duration cooperation by operating the long-range AUVs. However, the recently proposed AUV-based data-gathering protocols do not consider the energy consumption and tour time of AUVs, and what is worse repeat the cluster reconstruction by AUVs for the uniform energy consumption. Thus, via these protocols, AUVs can deplete their energy more quickly before fulfilling their missions. Also, there are path-planning algorithms that have reflected AUV's energy consumption. However, they do not consider AUV's maneuvering that causes AUVs to pay lots of costs, and thus AUVs cannot perform the long-range operation. The objective of this paper is to develop a data-gathering protocol based on AUV path planning that maximizes the mission time for the cooperative data-gathering. To achieve this goal, an enhanced lawn mower pattern path is designed to support both the long-range AUVs and the uniform energy consumption of sensor nodes. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol outperforms the recently proposed data-gathering protocol with respect to the long-duration cooperation for data-gathering, thereby increasing the lifetime of UWASNs.

ID PATH-FOLLOWING CONTROL; SURFACE VEHICLES
AB A crucial and challenging issue in path following control of the autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) is input constraint and communication burden. In this paper, an intervened logic virtual ship (ILVS) guidance is developed to generate the reference signal, and further to tackle the input saturation constraint by employing the dynamic feedback evaluation rule. The main superiority of this design is to intervene the logic virtual ship (LVS) guidance principle to avoid the persistent large stabilization error. Associated with ILVS guidance framework, a robust adaptive neural event-triggered algorithm is proposed for the ASV by fusing the adaptive technique and the multiport event-triggered approach. The constrains of the model nonlinear term and the uncertain actuators gain are released by constructing online learning parameters. Furthermore, the channel resource from the sensor to the controller (SC) as well as the controller to the actuator (CA) is reduced for merits of the multiport event-triggered approach. The feedback error signals and the control inputs will be updated while the triggered condition is occurred. That also can eliminate the low frequency disturbance, caused by marine environment, to improve the robustness of the closed-loop system. Through the Lyapunov stability criterion, all state variables in the triggered point and triggered interval are achieved semi-global uniform ultimate bounded (SGUUB) stability. Finally, the control performance of the proposed method is evaluated on simulation platform, showing the satisfied tracking accuracy with the low transmission load.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are utilized in a variety of unmanned missions, such as environmental surveys or guarding coastal waters. Currently, the most commonly used energy storage is a secondary battery pack. A potential solution for increasing the range even further on larger AUVs is to utilize hybrid fuel cell/battery systems. Fuel cell systems can have a significantly increased specific energy compared to batteries and are now starting to become well-developed technologies. However, in an underwater environment, both hydrogen and oxygen need to be stored for the fuel cell. This study considers the sizing of a hybrid fuel cell/battery system with respect to operational power profiles, i.e., how to select the best combination of fuel cell stack, battery pack, and reactant storage, and compares its volume and weight with conventional battery systems. This article presents a sizing strategy developed for this purpose, where the optimum combination of fuel cell output power and battery size is analyzed. The strategy is implemented on power profiles from real AUV missions. The sizing strategy will outline the techniques to reach the optimum hybrid configuration capable of meeting the power demand at any time of the mission. Results show that for longer missions, the volume of the hybrid system becomes significantly lower than for the battery system, meaning that the endurance can be increased thanks to the use of fuel cells.

AB Exploration of the continental slope of the Canadian Beaufort Sea has revealed a remarkable coalescence of slide scars with headwalls between 130 and 1100 m water depth (mwd). With increased depth, the scars widen and merge into one gigantic regional slide scar that is more than 100 km wide below similar to 1100 mwd. To understand the development of these features, five sites were investigated with an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle, which provided 1-m bathymetric grids and Chirp profiles, and surveyed with a Remotely Operated Vehicle. The morphologies are consistent with retrograde failures that occurred on failure planes located between 30 and 75 m below the modern seafloor. At issue is whether the continental slope in this area is preconditioned for failure. While rapid sedimentation during glacial periods, and the presence of shallow gas cannot be ruled out, given the geological environment, it is unclear that they are primary preconditioning factors. Evidence of widespread flushing of the slope with brackish waters, and observed flows of brackish water within slide scars, suggest fluid venting and overpressure may play a role in the development of the extensive slope failures seen along this margin. The impact of pore water salinity changes at the depth of the failure plane on slope stability has not been considered in marine settings previously.

AB Aerosol impacts on climate change are still poorly understood, in part, because the few observations and methods for detecting their effects are not well established. For the first time, the enhancement in cloud albedo is directly measured on a cloud-by-cloud basis and linked to increasing aerosol concentrations by using multiple autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles to simultaneously observe the cloud microphysics, vertical aerosol distribution, and associated solar radiative fluxes. In the presence of long-range transport of dust and anthropogenic pollution, the trade cumuli have higher droplet concentrations and are on average brighter. Our observations suggest a higher sensitivity of radiative forcing by trade cumuli to increases in cloud droplet concentrations. than previously reported owing to a constrained droplet radius such that increases in droplet concentrations also increase cloud liquid water content. This aerosol-cloud forcing efficiency is as much as -60 W m(-2) per 100% percent cloud fraction for a doubling of droplet concentrations and associated increase of liquid water content. Finally, we develop a strategy for detecting aerosol-cloud interactions based on a nondimensional scaling analysis that relates the contribution of single clouds to albedo measurements and illustrates the significance of characterizing cloud morphology in resolving radiometric measurements. This study demonstrates that aerosol-cloud-albedo interactions can be directly observed by simultaneous observations below, in, and above the clouds.

AB Traffic oscillations often occur in road traffic, they make traffic flow unstable, unsafe and inefficient. Emerging connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technologies are potential solutions to mitigating the traffic oscillations for the advantages that CAVs are controllable and cooperative. In order to study a control strategy and the effectiveness of CAVs in mitigating traffic oscillations and improving traffic flow and analyse the characteristics of homogeneous traffic flow made up of CAVs and heterogeneous traffic flow made up of CAVs and RVs when traffic oscillations appear in traffic flow. Firstly, the formation and propagation of traffic oscillations in a platoon of RVs are simulated and analysed. Then, a car-following control model is built to control the longitudinal motion of CAVs, and real-time information of preceding CAV is used in the model and this can make the motion of CAVs more cooperative. The model reflects an idea named "slow-in" and "fast-out," and this idea is helpful to mitigate traffic oscillations. Then, numerical simulations of homogeneous traffic flow of a platoon of CAVs and simulations of heterogeneous traffic flow containing CAVs and RVs are conducted, and different penetration rates (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1) of CAVs are considered in the simulations of heterogeneous traffic flow. The characteristics and evolution of traffic flow are analysed and some indexes reflecting traffic efficiency and stability are calculated and analysed. Simulation results show that there are smaller velocity fluctuation, less stopping time and shorter length of road occupied when vehicle platoon contains CAVs (penetration rates are from 0.2 to 1) compared to the platoon containing only RVs (without CAVs). As for the heterogeneous traffic flow containing CAVs and RVs, these three indexes decrease with the increase of penetration rates (from 0.2 to 1) of CAVs. These results indicate that CAVs with the car-following control model in vehicle platoon are beneficial for mitigating traffic oscillations and improving traffic flow.

AB Electrified autonomous mobility-on-demand (E-AMoD) systems will play a crucial role in future cities, which couple the carbon emissions generated by the transportation system and the power system. This paper proposes a joint dispatching framework to facilitate city decarbonization by coordinating the fleet operator and power system operator. Given the substantial differences in spatial and temporal dispatching scales between the two systems, this framework effectively integrates micro vehicle-level service dispatching with macro fleet-level charging scheduling. Firstly, a novel bipartite matching model efficiently solves the short-term passenger serving and rebalancing dispatching at the vehicle level. The service dispatching results are then aggregated as spatial-temporal transition flows across different areas and time intervals. Incorporating these mobility constraints, the long-term charging-discharging scheduling at the fleet level is captured as an expanded network flow model and integrated with the power system dispatching model, which aims at renewable energy utilization and carbon emission mitigation. Finally, the fleet-level scheduling results are disaggregated to the servingrebalancing-charging sequences of each vehicle, for practical implementation. To validate the proposed framework, numerical experiments are conducted on a large-scale real-world case. Multiple charging schedule scenarios, including heuristic charging, smart charging, and smart charging-discharging, are investigated under both centralized and distributed supplied power systems. (1) The framework proves to be an effective solution for addressing the differences in dispatching spatiotemporal scales, calculation efficiencies, and privacy concerns between power and traffic systems. (2) Through power-traffic coordination, the E-AMoD fleet demonstrates its ability to alleviate 8% of average renewable energy curtailment and reduce nearly 15% of the total emissions in a power system installed with renewable distributed generators. (3) Furthermore, the extent of emission mitigation effects is influenced by critical factors such as fleet size, renewable energy profile, and power system capacity. Overall, the E-AMoD system show great potential as mobile storage devices to provide spatial-temporal flexibility to the power system and contribute to city decarbonization.

AB The flow control capability (especially for separation control) of a dielectric-barrier-discharge plasma actuator (DBD-PA) has been investigated extensively. However, these studies have been conducted under ideal conditions, such as wind tunnels and computational environments, and limited studies have investigated the effects of plasma actuators in an actual environment. In this study, the flow control capability of a DBD-PA under natural and in-flight conditions was investigated via field flight tests using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The DBD-PA driving system was constructed with a small high-voltage power supply on a 2-m-span UAV. With the support of an autonomous flight system, the pitch angle gradually increased as the airspeed decreased, and the stall occurred from the cruise state. This flight procedure was conducted with the DBD-PA on or off, and 246 pairs of flights were operated. The results revealed that a flight state with a higher pitch angle and lower airspeed occurred when DBD-PA was switched on. In addition, the moment of stall was quantitatively determined from the flight log, and it was confirmed that the maximum pitch angle when DBD-PA was switched on tended to be larger than that when DBD-PA was switched off. These results indicate that flow control with a DBD-PA on a 2-m-span UAV was effective in natural and in-flight situations.

AB In intelligent vehicular networks, vehicles should be able to communicate with their surroundings while traveling. This results in more efficient, safer, and comfortable driving experiences, as well as new commercial prospects in a variety of industries. Connected vehicles and autonomous vehicles expect 100% reliable connectivity without any compromise in quality. However, due to challenges such as difficult channel terrains in urban scenarios and dead zones, the reliability of current vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle communication systems cannot be guaranteed. The performance of vehicular networks can be considerably enhanced with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS). Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) allows for massive connectivity with the surroundings. In vehicular networks, the RIS-assisted NOMA can ensure regulated channel gains, better coverage, throughput, and energy efficiency. In this work, a blind RIS-assisted fixed NOMA (FNOMA) system is proposed for a downlink V2I scenario. The closed-form analytical outage probability and throughput expressions are derived by considering RIS as an intelligent reflector and as a roadside unit. It is observed that the analytical and Monte Carlo simulation results are closely related. In simulations, it has been discovered that RIS-assisted FNOMA outperforms the traditional NOMA variants in terms of outage and throughput. Even without precise channel knowledge, blind RIS transmission outperforms traditional NOMA variants due to huge array gain. The increase in the number of reflective elements also results in a significant improvement in signal-to-noise ratio gains.

ID MODEL
AB Lane-changing behaviour is one of the most important and basic driving behaviours. Intelligent and connected vehicles must face lane-changing scenarios to achieve autonomous driving. To improve the rationality of lane-changing trajectory planning for intelligent vehicles, by analysing numerous real vehicle lane-changing trajectories in the German HighD natural driving dataset, a dimensionless lateral quantification balance index is proposed to realise a comprehensive and objective evaluation of the degree of human-likeness of lane change trajectory planning. Focused on the lateral kinematic characteristics of lane changing, a lane-changing trajectory extraction method based on the peak-to-peak value of lateral acceleration is proposed. Lateral displacement, lateral velocity, lateral acceleration and lane-changing duration are extracted from natural driving data, and the correlations between the parameters are revealed to deduce the lateral quantification balance index. With several common parametric lane-changing trajectory models of intelligent vehicles, such as sine, quintic polynomial, Gaussian and hyperbolic tangent and fifth-order Bessel models, as examples, the index values of each lane-changing trajectory model are calculated and obtained. Results show that the proposed index can balance the different requirements in lane-changing efficiency and comfort of the trajectory parameters during the lane-changing process, thus achieving a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of lateral stability, efficiency and comfort. This research establishes an intuitive and concise objective function for human-like trajectory planning and provides a basis for trajectory tracking control and real-time dynamic correction of intelligent vehicles.

TI Expansion of the Fundamental Diagram from a Microscopic Multilane
   Modeling Framework of Mixed Traffic
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION

AB Microscopic modeling of mixed traffic (i.e., automaton-driven vehicles and human-driven vehicles) dynamics, particularly car-following, lane-changing, and gap-acceptance, provides the opportunity to gain a more accurate estimation of flow-density relationships for both traditional traffic with human-driven vehicles and different mixed traffic scenarios. Our paper proposes a microscopic framework to model multilane traffic for both vehicle types on shared roadways which sets the stage to explore the capability of macroscopic car-following models in general to explain the fundamental flow-density relationship. Since prior models inadequately represent the fundamental diagram realistically, we propose a rectified macroscopic flow model that can account for the impact of both lane-changing and gap-acceptance. Differentiability, boundary conditions, and flexibility of the proposed model are tested to validate its applicability. Finally, the capability to interpret the flow-density relationship by the proposed model is verified for different mixed traffic scenarios. Although few model parameter values were obtained directly from the simulation input, the rest of the parameters have been calibrated by flow and density outputs from the simulations. The analysis results show a distinct correlation between the proposed model parameters with automation-driven vehicle shares and lane-changing rates of traffic. The findings from this study emphasize the importance of taking complete motion dynamics into account, rather than partial motion dynamics (i.e., car-following) as has been the case in the previous studies, to explain macroscopic traffic flow characteristics, irrespective of the vehicle type.

AB Deep learning methods, particularly in the field of vehicle detection, have significantly increased in recent years. It plays an important role in detecting vehicles. In the case of autonomous driving and traffic control systems, accurate vehicle detection is necessary. To achieve accuracy, the network model's depth is increased, resulting in increased computational complexity and slow data processing. During severe weather, the majority of detection systems fail. Therefore, this research develops a new approach called ShortYOLO-CSP to enhance the detection of vehicles in challenging environments based on LittleYOLO-SPP. The depth of baseline network layers is re-designed, and Cross-Stage Partial (CSP) connection technique is used to reduce computational cost. The concatenation of the Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) blocks improves the learning abilities of the model by combining spatial characteristics. To accelerate the training process, Complete Intersection over union (CIoU) loss function for bounding box regression was adopted. The proposed model not only recognizes tiny cars, but also improves the accuracy of detection in a variety of weather situations, according to extensive testing on the combined datasets of PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, MS COCO 2014, and Indian Vehicle datasets. Additionally, this framework significantly outperforms the LittleYOLO-SPP by increasing mean average precision (mAP) by almost 10%. PASCAL VOC and COCO achieved state-of-the-art outcomes, with mAPs 91.32% and 63.27%, respectively. Furthermore, the suggested strategy also has a considerable impact on accuracy and cuts down on inference time.

AB Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the way intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) operate in smart cities. By providing a secure and decentralized platform for data exchange and storage, blockchain can enhance the security, privacy, and interoperability of ITS systems. Blockchain technology can be used for various applications in ITS, including secure data exchange between vehicles, infrastructure, and service providers, smart contracts for autonomous vehicles, and decentralized marketplaces for transportation services. However, implementing blockchain in ITS comes with its own set of challenges, including scalability and high computational power requirements. Despite the challenges, blockchain technology offers significant opportunities for ITS in smart cities, enabling new business models and promoting innovation in transportation services. In this article, we study existing challenges, applications, and future requirements for ITS. We discuss the challenges of the ITS and their impact on smart cities. Blockchain-enabled applications are provided with performance analysis based on the critical parameters of ITS. We also derive the security requirements for future ITS. Finally, we provide some opportunities and possible research areas within the ITS to develop smart cities.

AB The increase application of machine learning and artificial intelligence in the field of robotics, have emerged the need for real time algorithms for autonomous unmanned aircraft and surface vehicles. In recent years, various studies have been conducted for path planning of unmanned surface vehicle (USV), especially to maritime transportation. Most of the traditional approaches include optimization algorithms for finding the shortest or fastest path. However, USV motion in complex environments demand multi-objective optimization and multimodality constraints to cope with dynamic environments and moving obstacles. To this end, an improved Ant Colony Optimization with Fuzzy Logic (ACO-FL) is proposed to deal with local path planning for obstacle avoidance by taking into account wind, current, wave and dynamic obstacles. The proposed algorithm was compared to original ACO and popular Bug algorithm in simulation tests. The results showed that ACO-FL reached better performance compared to the other algorithms under examination in terms of optimal solution and convergence speed. Thus, the proposed algorithm can be considered as an effective approach for path planning of USVs.

AB Real-time navigation systems rely on multi-object environment information for productive routing and assisted movements of vehicles. The multi-object environment includes infrastructure, neighbours, smart building, and traffic management information for providing assisted driving for the vehicles. The dynamic vehicle environment and sensor failures impact the navigation assistance for the driving users. A robust variance-based information fusion (VIF) technique is proposed in this paper for addressing this issue. The proposed technique makes use of swappable sensor information for fusion for providing reliable navigation assistance. This means the fusion process is performed based on the active sensor information in a decisive manner. For effective fusion with available information, this technique makes use of classification learning. Through this learning process, the error causing information due to sensor failures is identified and mitigated from the fusion. Multi-sensor information classification is performed for performing errorless assistance and decisions. This process is linear throughout the information sensing time intervals for reducing the errors in navigation assistance. The proposed technique's performance is verified using experiments, and the metrics processing time, error, accuracy, and swapping instances are verified.

AB This paper presents the technological measures currently being developed at institutes and vehicle research centres dealing with forefront road identification. In this case, road identification corresponds with the surface irregularities and road surface type, which are evaluated by laser scanning and image analysis. Real-time adaptation, adaptation in advance and system external informing are stated as sequential generations of vehicle suspension and active braking systems where road identification is significantly important. Active and semi-active suspensions with their adaptation technologies for comfort and road holding characteristics are analysed. Also, an active braking system such as Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) and Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) have been considered as very sensitive to the road friction state. Artificial intelligence methods of deep learning have been presented as a promising image analysis method for classification of 12 different road surface types. Concluding the achieved benefit of road identification for traffic safety improvement is presented with reference to analysed research reports and assumptions made after the initial evaluation.

AB We propose an approach for vision-based navigation of underwater robots that relies on the use of video mosaics of the sea bottom as environmental representations for navigation.
   We present a methodology for building high-quality video mosaics of the sea bottom in a fully automatic manner, which ensures global spatial coherency. During navigation, a set of efficient visual routines are used for the fast and accurate localization of the underwater vehicle with respect to the mosaic. These visual routines were developed taking into account the operating requirements of real-time position sensing, error bounding, and computational load.
   A visual servoing controller, based on the vehicle's kinematics, is used to drive the vehicle along a computed trajectory, specified in the mosaic, while maintaining constant altitude. The trajectory toward a goal point is generated online to avoid undefined areas in the mosaic.
   We have conducted a large set of sea trials, under realistic operating conditions. This paper demonstrates that without resorting to additional sensors, visual information can be used to create environment representations of the sea bottom (mosaics) and support long runs of navigation in a robust manner.

AB The primary focus of study in this paper is the background control theory for automated lane change maneuvers. We provide an analytic approach for the systematic development of controllers that will cause an autonomous vehicle to accomplish a smooth lane change suitable for use in an Automated Highway System. The design is motivated by the discontinuous availability of valid preview data from the sensing systems during lane-to-lane transitions. The task is accomplished by the generation of a virtual yaw reference and the utilization of a robust switching controller to generate steering commands that cause the vehicle to track that reference. In this way, the open loop lane change problem is converted into an equivalent virtual reference trajectory tracking problem. The approach considers optimality in elapsed time at an operating longitudinal velocity. Although the analysis is performed assuming that the road is straight, the generalization of the proposed algorithm to arbitrary road segments is rather straightforward. The outlined lane change algorithm has been implemented and tested on The Ohio State University test vehicles. Some of the experimental results are presented at the conclusion of this paper.

AB Lateral vehicle dynamics control is important for autonomous driving. This paper presents a data-driven design of model-referenced model-free control (DD-MR-MFC) based on an ultra-local model for vehicle yaw rate control. The characteristics of lateral vehicle dynamics systems depend on vehicle velocities and weights. For this system, fixed proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers cannot provide the desired control performance. Additionally, although model-based control can be applied to lateral vehicle dynamics, the modeling process is time-consuming. To efficiently design controllers that can realize the desired performance, we adopt a model-free approach. In this study, the control law of practical MR-MFC is derived by extending the traditional MFC based on an ultra-local model and using a data-driven design method. The MFC approach can be applied to nonlinear systems with few parameters, and the data-driven method provides optimized parameters from single-experiment time-series data without the need for repeated experiments and system model to be controlled. Additionally, the processing cost is considerably low because the controller parameter can be obtained using least-square methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using a multibody vehicle simulator. The yaw rate tracking performance is examined under different velocities and loads. Results showed that the root-mean-square error of the proposed method is approximately 1/100th of that when using a fixed PID controller optimized using a data-driven method.

AB In recent years, the level of acceptance of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has changed with the advent of new sensor technologies and the proportional increase in market perception of these vehicles. Our study provides an overview of the relevant existing studies in order to consolidate current knowledge and pave the way for future studies in this area. The paper first reviews studies investigating the market acceptance of AVs. We identify the nonbehavioural factors that account for the level of acceptance and examine these in detail by cross-referencing the results of relevant papers published between 2014 and 2021 to reach a consensus on the perceived benefits and concerns. The findings showed that previous studies have found legal liability, safety, privacy, security, traffic conditions, and cost to be key external factors influencing the acceptance or rejection of AVs, and that the upsides of adopting AVs in regard to improving traffic conditions and safety outweigh the risks identified in relation to these areas. This resulted in an overall weighted average of 65% market acceptance of AVs among the 11,057 people surveyed in this regard. However, the remaining respondents were not very favourably disposed towards adopting AVs because of unresolved issues related to data privacy, security breaches, and legal liability in the event of accidents. In addition, our evaluation showed that the worldwide market purchasing power for an AV, based on 2022 prices, is around $38k, which is significantly below the current anticipated price of $100k.

AB The motion coordination problem for a fleet of Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) in a confined industrial facility is addressed. The working scenario involves a group of AGVs that is tasked to transport without collisions to predefined locations within the industrial facility. We introduce a centralized motion coordination controller that utilizes a dynamic priority logic to resolve motion conflicts between AGVs as they appear. The controller relies on the implementation of a predefined, virtual transportation network that is comparable to a conventional right-handed bidirectional traffic system. The construction of the transportation network considers the physical and motion characteristics of the AGVs (dimensions and maximum speed). The high-level function of the controller is to detect imminent collisions and determine the right-of-way of conflicting AGVs in same-directional routes and intersection junctions of the transportation network. The priority update logic is inspired by the traffic control of conventional four-way stop-controlled intersections. Based on the updated priorities, the motion coordinator adjusts the advancement of the AGVs to eliminate collisions. The proposed formulation combines a high-level event-driven logic for collision avoidance with low-level feedback control laws for guidance and navigation. As a result, the controller relies only on real-time measurements, removing the need for computationally demanding look-ahead predictions (heuristics) of the AGVs' motion. It is shown that the proposed method ensures collision- and blockage-free motion of a large number of AGVs. Extensive numerical simulations validate the performance of the motion coordination algorithm. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Detecting vehicle at night is critical to both assistant driving systems and autonomous driving systems. In this paper, we propose a deep network scheme assisted by light information with good generalization to detect vehicle at night. Our approach is divided into two branches, the object stream and the pixel stream. The object stream generates a batch of bounding boxes, and the pixel stream utilizes the vehicle light information to calibrate the bounding boxes of the object stream. In the object stream, we propose a new structure, Direction Attention Pooling (DAP), to improve the accuracy of the prior boxes. DAP leads into attention mechanism. The feature maps obtained from backbone network is divided into two branches. One branch obtains direction perception information through IRNN layer, and the other branch learns attention weights. The weights are multiplied with the direction perception features in an element-wise manner. In the pixel stream, we propose a corner localization algorithm based on Bayes to get more accurate corners with the vehicle light pixels. The locations of the corners are considered as a discrete random variable. When the mask of the object is known, solving the probability distribution of the corner of the object is the next step. The corners with the highest probability is the correct corner. On the nighttime vehicle detection datasets CHUK and SYSU, our method achieves the accuracy of 97.2% and 96.86%, which outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by at least 0.31% and 0.34%.

AB Despite numerous studies on general human-robot interactions, in the context of transportation, automated vehicle (AV)-human driver interaction is not a well-studied subject. These vehicles have fundamentally different decision-making logic compared with human drivers and the driving interactions between AVs and humans can potentially change traffic flow dynamics. Accordingly, through an experimental study, this paper investigates whether there is a difference between human-human and human-AV interactions on the road. This study focuses on car-following behavior and conducted several car-following experiments utilizing Texas A&M University's automated Chevy Bolt. Utilizing NGSIM US-101 dataset, two scenarios for a platoon of three vehicles were considered. For both scenarios, the leader of the platoon follows a series of speed profiles extracted from the NGSIM dataset. The second vehicle in the platoon can be either another human-driven vehicle (scenario A) or an AV (scenario B). Data is collected from the third vehicle in the platoon to characterize the changes in driving behavior when following an AV. A data-driven and a model-based approach were used to identify possible changes in driving behavior from scenario A to scenario B. The findings suggested there is a statistically significant difference between human drivers' behavior in these two scenarios and human drivers felt more comfortable following the AV. Simulation results also revealed the importance of capturing these changes in human behavior in microscopic simulation models of mixed driving environments.

AB Tight unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomous missions such as formation flight (FF) and aerial refueling (AR) require an active controller that works in conjunction with a precise sensor that is able to identify an in-front aircraft and to estimate its relative position and orientation. Among possible choices vision sensors are of interest because they are passive in nature and do not require the cooperation of the in-front aircraft in any way. In this paper new vision-based estimation and navigation algorithms based on neural networks is developed. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm have been validated via a detailed modeling and a complete virtual environment based on the six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) nonlinear simulation of aircraft dynamics in an autonomous aerial refueling (AAR) mission. In addition a full-state time-variant tracking controller based on the pole placement method is designed to generate required commands for aircraft control surfaces and engine during an AAR. The performance of the system in the presence of noise has also been examined.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are used in many areas where their usage is increasing constantly. Their popularity, therefore, maintains its importance in the technology world. Parallel to the development of technology, human standards, and surroundings should also improve equally. This study is developed based on the possibility of timely delivery of urgent medical requests in emergency situations. Using UAVs for delivering urgent medical requests will be very effective due to their flexible maneuverability and low costs. However, off-the-shelf UAVs suffer from limited payload capacity and battery constraints. In addition, urgent requests may be requested at an uncertain time, and delivering in a short time may be crucial. To address this issue, we proposed a novel framework that considers the limitations of the UAVs and dynamically requested packages. These previously unknown packages have source-destination pairs and delivery time intervals. Furthermore, we utilize deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, deep Q-network (DQN), proximal policy optimization (PPO), and advantage actor-critic (A2C) to overcome this unknown environment and requests. The comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the PPO algorithm has a faster and more stable training performance than the other DRL algorithms in two different environmental setups. Also, we implemented an extension version of a Brute-force (BF) algorithm, assuming that all requests and environments are known in advance. The PPO algorithm performs very close to the success rate of the BF algorithm.

ID AUTOMATED VEHICLES; TROLLEY
AB The potential development of self-driving cars (also known as autonomous vehicles or AVs - particularly Level 5 AVs) has called the attention of different interested parties. Yet, there are still only a few relevant international regulations on them, no emergency patterns accepted by communities and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), and no publicly accepted solutions to some of their pending ethical problems. Thus, this paper aims to provide some possible answers to these moral and practical dilemmas. In particular, we focus on what AVs should do in no-win scenarios and on who should be held responsible for these types of decisions. A naturalistic perspective on ethics informs our proposal, which, we argue, could represent a pragmatic and realistic solution to the regulation of AVs. We discuss the proposals already set out in the current literature regarding both policy-making strategies and theoretical accounts. In fact, we consider and reject descriptive approaches to the problem as well as the option of using either a strict deontological view or a solely utilitarian one to set AVs' ethical choices. Instead, to provide concrete answers to AVs' ethical problems, we examine three hierarchical levels of decision-making processes: country-wide regulations, OEM policies, and buyers' moral attitudes. By appropriately distributing ethical decisions and considering their practical implications, we maintain that our proposal based on ethical naturalism recognizes the importance of all stakeholders and allows the most able of them to take actions (the OEMs and buyers) to reflect on the moral leeway and weight of their options.

AB This research presents a framework based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict jaywalker's trajectory while crossing the road. In this process, different causal and conditional variables related to jaywalking, such as, gender, direction of crossing, walking or running, cell phone use, roadway lane number, etc. are taken as input variables. The dataset comprises of 2504 samples which is collected under non-lane based heterogeneous traffic conditions. Through testing predictive performance of several ANN architectures based on correlation coefficient and mean square error, the best ANN architecture to predict jaywalker's movement is determined. The optimal ANN architecture comprises of 9 input nodes, 10 hidden nodes and 1 output node. This study also determines the microscopic variables, i.e., speed, flow and density, associated with jaywalking. The results indicate that the average speed of male jaywalkers is higher than female jaywalkers. The density is found to be higher in the last lanes of the crossing paths. In addition, this research develops jaywalker trajectories in order to understand their position shifting strategies. Findings suggest that `median to sidewalk' movement trajectories tend to move closer to the foot-over bridge, whereas, the `sidewalk to median' movement trajectories tend to move further away from foot-over bridge. The outcome of this research is expected to assist driver assistance technology as well as Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) technologies by allowing vehicles to safely navigate through both clustered and individual jaywalkers.

   environments within a consensus framework
SO MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING

AB The continuous, reliable, and accurate acquisition of position information is a fundamental requirement for autonomous vehicles. It underpins perception, decision-making, and planning modules in automated driving systems. However, the performance of multi-modal sensors, including the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and LiDAR, typically found in autonomous vehicles, is easily influenced by complex environmental factors encountered in urban driving conditions. This creates challenges for existing localization algorithms. More specifically, while GNSS performs accurately in open-sky areas, it is susceptible to the multi-path effect. Although the IMU-based Inertial Navigation System (INS) provides continuous position data, it suffers from cumulative errors. LiDAR-based map-matching is highly effective when sufficient point cloud features are present but fall short in plain environments. To address these individual sensor deficiencies, we propose the application of a consensus framework for GNSS/IMU/LiDAR fusion, and it is able to be expanded for multi-modal sensor fusion. Our approach seeks to take advantage of the redundancy inherent in these sensor sys-tems. Our method begins with the derivation of the INS mechanization and its error dynamics. Subsequently, based on the Consensus Kalman Filter (CKF), we establish a GNSS measurement node and a Normal Distribution Transformation (NDT) map-matching measurement node. These are designed to estimate position errors in the INS. To counter sensor measurement failure or degradation, we introduce an adaptation mechanism for the CKF. This ensures position accuracy and continuity by normalizing measurement quality across different measurement nodes. Finally, to validate our consensus-based localization framework, we conducted extensive real-world vehicle tests in urban driving conditions. The results have confirmed the superior accuracy and robustness of our approach, even in the face of individual sensor failure. In our experiments, the proposed method reduces the localization mean absolute error by around 17% compared to INS/map-matching fusion, and around 59% compared to INS/GNSS fusion while map-matching fails. While the GNSS and map-matching measurements contain large noises, our framework achieves at least approximately a 30% improvement compared to traditional methods.

AB The cutting-edge technology of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) will advance transportation systems for the foreseeable future. CAVs are expected to maintain fully automated judgment and manipulation without human intervention and, additionally, create safer driving and smarter traffic management. Digital twins (DTs) are the quiet but powerful forces enabling these new possibilities behind the scenes. In this article, we design a DT network (DTN) consisting of connected DTs to help CAVs in terms of ubiquitous perception, adaptive path planning, and precise motion control. Heterogeneous learning models and diverse learning methods are employed at different scales of solution, progressing toward specificity, adaptation, and accuracy. Qualitative evaluation of the proposed system is performed with the final goal of demonstrating the DTN's assistance in improving the performance and effectiveness of CAVs, ultimately leading to a safer, more efficient, and more sustainable transportation system.

AB The lateral motion of an Automated Vehicle (AV) is highly affected by the model's uncertainties and unknown external disturbances during its navigation in adverse environmental conditions. Among the variety of controllers, the sliding mode controller (SMC), known for its robustness towards disturbances, is considered to generate a robust control signal under uncertainties. However, conventional SMC suffers from the issue of high frequency oscillations, called chattering. To address the issue of chattering and reduce the effect of unknown external disturbances in the absence of precise model information, a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is employed to estimate the equivalent control. Further, a higher order sliding mode (HOSM) based switching control is proposed in this paper to compensate for the effect of external disturbances. The effectiveness of the proposed controller in terms of lane-keeping and lateral stability is demonstrated through simulation in a high-fidelity Carsim-Matlab Simulink environment under a variety of road and environmental conditions.

AB Recently, mobile crowd sensing (MCS) has been widely used in smart cities with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and autonomous cars. To ensure long-term, long-distance sensing tasks of UAVs, mobile unmanned charging stations, called "Carriers", are scheduled to reach preset charging locations in a city to provide charging services. However, existing methods not only have difficulty in serving a large number of UAVs, but also face a big challenge of potential security vulnerabilities in the charging transactions. To address the above issues, this paper explores the blockchain technology to design an auction-based framework for scheduling charging services for UAVs while improving the security of charging transactions. In particular, considering the revenues of Carriers and the utilities of UAVs, we develop a new auction mechanism based on the emerging deep reinforcement learning technique to improve the auction performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can enhance charging transactions' security and optimize the system performance.

AB A compact wideband bandpass filter with a very wide stopband for terrestrial radio (TETRA) band applications is proposed. The proposed filter employs two types of resonators: one is tri-section half wavelength stepped impedance resonator (SIR) and the other is stubloaded shorted ring resonator. The proposed filter has adopted SIRs and meandering technique in achieving miniaturised size. Spur-lines and tapped feeding techniques are infused in the filter to suppress harmonics so as to achieve wide stopband. Cross-coupling is introduced in the filter for acquiring good selectivity. This highly selective filter has a miniaturised size of 0.09 x 0.12.g (28 x 36.8 mm2) with a wide stopband up to 8.75f0 (f0 is the centre frequency of filter) with 25 dB harmonics suppression level.

AB With the increasing number of vehicles, manual security inspections are becoming more laborious at road checkpoints. To address it, a specialized Road Checkpoints Robot (RCRo) system is proposed, incorporated with enhanced You Only Look Once (YOLO) and a 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) manipulator, for autonomous identity verification and vehicle inspection. The modified YOLO is characterized by large objects' sensitivity and faster detection speed, named "LF-YOLO". The better sensitivity of large objects and the faster detection speed are achieved by means of the Dense module-based backbone network connecting two-scale detecting network, for object detection tasks, along with optimized anchor boxes and improved loss function. During the manipulator motion, Octree-aided motion control scheme is adopted for collision-free motion through Robot Operating System (ROS). The proposed LF-YOLO which utilizes continuous optimization strategy and residual technique provides a promising detector design, which has been found to be more effective during actual object detection, in terms of decreased average detection time by 68.25% and 60.60%, and increased average Intersection over Union (IoU) by 20.74% and 6.79% compared to YOLOv3 and YOLOv4 through experiments. The comprehensive functional tests of RCRo system demonstrate the feasibility and competency of the multiple unmanned inspections in practice.(c) 2021 China Ordnance Society.

AB Trajectory tracking with collision avoidance for a multicopter is solved based on geometrical relations. In this paper, a new method is proposed for a multicopter to move from the start position to a desired destination and track a pre-planned trajectory, while avoiding collisions with obstacles. The controller consists of two parts: First, a tracking control is introduced based on the errors between the relative position of the multicopter and the reference path. Second, once the obstacles with a high possibility of collision are detected, a boundary sphere/cylinder of the obstacle is generated by the dimensions of the vehicle and the obstacles, so as to define the safety and risk areas. Afterwards, from the relation between the vehicle's motion direction, and the tangential lines from the vehicle's current position to the sphere/cylinder of the obstacle, a collision detection angle is computed to decide the fastest direction to take in order to avoid a collision. The obstacle/collision avoidance control is activated locally when an object is close, and null if the vehicle moves away from the obstacles. The velocity control law and the guidance law are obtained from the Lyapunov stability. In addition, a proportional controller is used at the end of vehicle's journey to ensure the vehicle stops at the target position. A numerical simulation in different scenarios was performed to prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB The suggested benefits of automated vehicles are plentiful, but many of the benefits depend on connectivity with other vehicles and infrastructure to be useful to the society at large. This paper identifies two main research gaps: first, to identify whether ITS-G5 can be a reliable communication link for V2V communication. Second, to discuss which implications the results have for practitioners working with the future implementation of CAVs. We answer these research gaps by introducing a conceptualization of V2V communication operationalized through controlled experiments with vehicles on a closed runway. In the experiments, onboard ITS-G5 communication devices are used for measuring signal strength and package loss between the vehicles. The results indicate that ITS-G5 technology has some limitations, especially for long range communication (>1500 m), and in cases with other traffic shadowing the signal. We conclude that although ITS-G5 has high risk of reduced radio link in non-line-of-sight situations and in situations where the radio signal is shadowed by other traffic, the latency and operational range would be sufficient for safety critical services in line-of-sight situations. For policymakers and practitioners working with implementing communication for vehicles, the results imply that large-scale piloting is critical for testing the technology in a realistic environment outside of the laboratories. In such environments different stakeholders and disciplines can meet and collaborate to avoid siloed approaches.

AB The European Union (EU) has set rather ambitious goals for reducing emissions and improving related environmental concerns. The majority of EU effort towards reducing emissions is aimed at vehicle manufacturers, mandating development of more efficient engines in order to reduce emissions. We propose a complementary approach to help reach the EU goals. Due to the need for motorists to repeatedly stop and accelerate while driving in urban areas, overall emission rates are observed to be higher in these environments than on open motorways. As a result, management algorithms that focus on harmonising the flow of traffic in urban centres have the potential to greatly reduce urban emission rates. In this paper, we propose a set of functionalities in form of "use cases" in order to illustrate the inefficiencies of urban traffic flow by utilising cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure. The major contribution of this paper is in addressing the potential positive impact of such measures. The results and the expected effects of the algorithms were determined using a microscopic traffic simulation model. Importantly, this approach also addresses the transition phase, when only a limited number of cooperative and automated vehicles' (CAVs) will be introduced into traffic, resulting in a mix of automated and non-automated vehicles on the roadways. We demonstrate that introducing CAVs into traffic can lead to significant progress towards EU emissions targets, even for lower penetration levels. According to our models, full use of CAVs on roadways would lead to a CO2 emissions decrease of 10-19%.

AB Unmanned vehicles need to know their location and direction information accurately to plan and navigate their paths. However, the positioning system is susceptible to interference from a variety of factors, which leads to increased positioning errors, thereby affecting the accuracy of unmanned vehicle positioning. An unmanned vehicle fusion positioning technology based on the "5G + Beidou" integrated positioning system was proposed. While using the "5G + Beidou" base station for positioning, the 3D point cloud image was fused, and the high-precision real-time positioning was carried out through the vehicle's autonomous navigation algorithm. This paper first analyzed the current situation and characteristics of GNSS technology and studied the key technologies and principles of the "5G + Beidou" integrated positioning system. Then, aiming at the difficulty of 5G base station deployment, the GNSS system parameter optimization scheme based on a multidimensional fusion structure was designed. Finally, in the experiment, it was verified that the fusion system could achieve higher precision positioning results compared with traditional single-dimensional GNSS and multi-dimensional GNSS. The technical advantages of "5G + Beidou" were used for data fusion processing of unmanned vehicles, and a positioning method based on the combination of 3D point cloud image and high-precision map was proposed. Through some experiments, it was concluded that the fusion location method could control the error below 0.1, which showed the accuracy of the fusion location.

AB One of the main operational challenges faced by the operators of one-way car-sharing systems is to ensure vehicle availability across the regions of the service areas with uneven patterns of rental requests. Fleet balancing strategies are required to maximise the demand served while minimising the relocation costs. However, the design of optimal relocation policies is a complex problem, and global optimisation solutions are often limited to very small network sizes for computational reasons. In this work, we propose a multi-stage decision support system for vehicle relocation that decomposes the general relocation problem into three independent decision stages to allow scalable solutions. Furthermore, we adopt a rolling horizon control strategy to cope with demand uncertainty. Our approach is highly modular and flexible, and we leverage it to design user-based, operator-based and robotic relocation schemes. Besides, we formulate the relocation problem considering both conventional cars and a new class of compact stackable vehicles that can be driven in a road train. We compare the proposed relocation schemes with two recognised benchmarks using a large data set of taxi trips in New York. Our results show that our approach is scalable and outperforms the benchmark schemes in terms of quality of service, vehicle utilisation and relocation efficiency. Furthermore, we find that stackable vehicles can achieve a relocation performance close to that of autonomous cars, even with a small workforce of relocators.

ID DESIGN; SAFETY
AB Motor vehicle crashes are one of the leading causes of injuries and deaths for police officers. Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) are driving control systems that have been found to improve civilian drivers' safety; however, the impact of ADAS on police officers' driving safety has yet to be investigated thoroughly. Disparities between driver states and tasks performed while driving between police and civilian drivers necessitate this distinction. This study identified the types of ADAS used in police vehicles, their impact on officers' safety, and proposed potential future ADAS features to be implemented in police vehicles. A systematic literature review was conducted using Google Scholar, Compendex, Web of Science, Transport Research International Documentation (TRID), and Google Patents databases to identify the most prevalent police vehicles used in the U.S., available ADAS features in those vehicles, and the impact of ADAS on officers' safety. A list of recommended ADAS features was developed based on the review of literature, authors' knowledge and experience in the field, and the findings of an online survey with 73 police officers. Results indicated the addition of multiple ADAS features including the front vehicle detection system, intersection collision avoidance, evasive steering systems, left turn assist, traffic sign detection system, traffic jam assist, two lane and lane-ending detection, wrong-way alert, and autonomous highway driving features have the potential to improve officer safety and performance while driving. However, there was a void of studies focused on ADAS effects on police driving safety which needs to be addressed in future investigations.

AB In this paper, a novel piecewise affine (PWA) modeling framework and a hybrid optimal control scheme based on the developed PWA model for the intelligent vehicle longitudinal dynamics are proposed. The proposed methodology approximates the nonlinear characteristics of the system major components, i.e. the engine, the automatic transmission and the tire, using the PWA representation method firstly. Due to the affine submodel switching behaviors of the PWA model and the fact that the intelligent vehicle must be worked in two discrete modes (driving and braking) for regulating the longitudinal velocity automatically, the control procedure of the intelligent vehicle longitudinal dynamics actually shows a hybrid nature with both continuous variables and discrete events. Thus, to further solve the system hybrid control problem, the intelligent vehicle longitudinal dynamics whose major components are modelled in the PWA form is further transformed into a computational mixed logical dynamical (MLD) model in this work, based on which a hybrid model predictive control (HMPC) strategy, which can simultaneously calculate the switching sequences of the intelligent vehicle longitudinal working modes (binary control inputs) and the throttle angle and braking pressure (continuous control inputs) during autonomous velocity regulation, is designed by solving a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem. Simulation and experimental results are finally provided to verify the superior control performance of the designed hybrid controller in longitudinal velocity regulation under typical driving conditions.

AB A high-definition (HD) map is becoming an integral component of future mobility systems such as autonomous and connected vehicles. Advances in computing systems, LiDAR technologies, and vehicle communication technologies have enabled the HD map to directly treat a point cloud map (PCM), modeling road environments as LiDAR signal-level data. However, if actual road environments are changed, the PCM, modeling the environments before changes, can not be used for vehicle applications. Accordingly, the PCM has to stay up-to-date states by reflecting the environment changes continuously. This paper presents a crowd-sourcing framework to update the PCM from environment changes continuously using LiDAR and vehicle communication. Multiple intelligent vehicles installed with the LiDAR sensors download the PCM from a map server via wireless vehicle communication. To minimize the effects of environment changes, a robust localization based on a hierarchical Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) estimates the pose (position and direction). The estimated pose is used to detect the differences between the PCM and environments, which are defined as map changes. The map changes are detected by the probabilistic and evidential theory considering the LiDAR characteristics, such as beam divergence and multi-echo. The detected map changes are uploaded to the map cloud server and merged into the PCM. The proposed crowd-sourcing framework to keep the PCM up-to-date is verified and evaluated via simulations and experiments in sites with road environment changes.

AB The projected rapid growth of the market penetration of connected and autonomous vehicle technologies (CAV) highlights the need for preparing sufficient highway capacity for a mixed traffic environment where a portion of vehicles are CAVs and the remaining are human-driven vehicles (HVs). This study proposes an analytical capacity model for highway mixed traffic based on a Markov chain representation of spatial distribution of heterogeneous and stochastic headways. This model captures not only the full spectrum of CAV market penetration rates but also all possible values of CAV platooning intensities that largely affect the spatial distribution of different headway types. Numerical experiments verify that this analytical model accurately quantifies the corresponding mixed traffic capacity at various settings. This analytical model allows for examination of the impact of different CAV technology scenarios on mixed traffic capacity. We identify sufficient and necessary conditions for the mixed traffic capacity to increase (or decrease) with CAV market penetration rate and platooning intensity. These theoretical results caution scholars not to take CAVs as a sure means of increasing highway capacity for granted but rather to quantitatively analyze the actual headway settings before drawing any qualitative conclusion. This analytical framework further enables us to build a compact lane management model to efficiently determine the optimal number of dedicated CAV lanes to maximize mixed traffic throughput of a multi-lane highway segment. This optimization model addresses varying demand levels, market penetration rates, platooning intensities and technology scenarios. The model structure is examined from a theoretical perspective and an analytical approach is identified to solve the optimal CAV lane number at certain common headway settings. Numerical analyses illustrate the application of this lane management model and draw insights into how the key parameters affect the optimal CAV lane solution and the corresponding optimal capacity. This model can serve as a useful and simple decision tool for near future CAV lane management. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many authors have pointed out the importance of determining the impact of ride-hailing (ridesourcing) on vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT), and thus on transport externalities like congestion. However, to date there is scant evidence on this subject. In this paper we use survey results on Uber use by residents of Santiago, Chile, and information from other studies to parameterize a model to determine whether the advent of ride-hailing applications increases or decreases the number of VKT. Given the intrinsic uncertainty on the value of some model parameters, we use a Monte Carlo simulation for a range of possible parameter values. Our results indicate that unless ride-hailing applications substantially increase average occupancy rate of trips and become shared or pooled ride-hailing, the impact is an increase in VKT. We discuss these results in light of current empirical research in this area.

AB Straight-ahead resistance tests and static-yaw runs up to 20 degrees yaw angle for the axi-symmetric bare hull configurations of the "Phoenix" underwater vehicle that were performed in the 90 m towing tank at the Institute for Ocean Technology, National Research Council, Canada, provided empirical formulae for the drag force, lift force and turning moment that are exerted on such axi-symmetric torpedo-shaped hull forms. The empirical formulae were then embedded in a numerical code to simulate the constant-depth planar manoeuvres of the MUN Explorer autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The simulation model was first calibrated using the sea-trial data, and then was used to study the turning manoeuvres and to compare the simulation results with those from theoretical formulae based on the linearized equations of motion. The simulation results show non-linear changes in the hydrodynamic coefficients as the turning manoeuvre becomes tighter. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Over the past decades, substantial research has been undertaken in the design of intelligent architecture for the rotorcraft-based unmanned aerial vehicles (RUAV). Designing intelligent architecture is a challenging problem because future RUAVs are utterly autonomous and their performance is comparable with that of manned vehicles. This paper deals with the design and development of a layered architectural framework that addresses the issue arising in autonomous intelligent control systems. The architecture consists of two layers. The high-level layer is occupied by planning routines. In this level, the waypoints and mission tasks from the command center are executed. The function of the low-level layer is to stabilize the flight and follow the commanded trajectory from the upper layer. These layers integrate the following functionalities: (1) waypoint navigation and control, which includes auto-landing; (2) obstacle detection and avoidance; (3) fault detection and identification; and (4) system reconfiguration in two levels (high-level and low-level controllers). The resulting layered architecture is discussed in detail. Moreover, the novel fault detection and identification method is developed to address multiplicative and additive faults. A testing environment for RUAV is developed to validate this architecture. Complete setup is carried out using an embedded board run under a real-time operating system. The algorithms are tested and evaluated using hardware-in-the-loop simulation (HILS). The simulation result proves that the proposed architecture demonstrates the desired efficiency and reliability.

   3D object detection models
AB Autonomous vehicles are becoming central for the future of mobility, supported by advances in deep learning techniques. The performance of aself-driving system is highly dependent on the quality of the perception task. Developments in sensor technologies have led to an increased availability of 3D scanners such as LiDAR, allowing for a more accurate representation of the vehicle's surroundings, leading to safer systems. The rapid development and consequent rise of research studies around self-driving systems since early 2010, resulted in a tremendous increase in the number and novelty of object detection methods. After the first wave of works that essentially tried to expand known techniques from object detection in images, more recently there has been a notable development in newer and more adapted to LiDAR data works. This paper addresses the existing literature on object detection using LiDAR data within the scope of self-driving and brings a systematic way for analysing it. Unlike general object detection surveys, we will focus on point-cloud data, which presents specific challenges, notably its high-dimensional and sparse nature. This work introduces a common object detection pipeline and taxonomy to facilitate a thorough comparison between different techniques and, departing from it, this work will critically examine the representation of data (critical for complexity reduction), feature extraction and finally the object detection models. A comparison between performance results of the different models is included, alongside with some future research challenges.

AB A cooperative vehicle-infrastructure system (CVIS) can provide perception information beyond the visual range for autonomous vehicles via roadside directional sensors, such as cameras, millimeter-wave radar, and lidar. The performance of roadside perception strongly depends on sensor placement, where physical occlusion between vehicles is inevitable. This paper proposes an occlusion degree model (ODM) to describe the dynamic occlusion between sensors, obstacles, and targets in a three-dimensional space. The ODM is then integrated with microscopic traffic simulation to study the impacts of traffic density, vehicle model composition, and sensor configurations on vehicle detection and tracking performances. Based on the simulation, a multifactor regression model with a logistic growth curve is established to quantify the performance of roadside sensors with different factors, where the evaluation metrics are rigorously designed. Finally, an optimization model of roadside sensor placement with non-linear constraints is formulated to reduce the construction cost under a coverage constraint and improve the perception accuracy within budget limitations. A case study of a highway scenario shows that the performance of the proposed approach improves by 5.63%, 6.55%, and 8.01%, respectively, under the worst possible condition with accuracy requirements of 0.97, 0.96, and 0.95 compared with the conventional placement scheme. The study provides a map of the performance of roadside perception with different influencing factors and guides the optimal roadside sensor placement for a CVIS.

AB With the development of technology, platoons of intelligent and connected vehicles (ICVs) will join regular vehicles on roads, and the characteristics of the traffic flow will change accordingly. In this paper, the traffic flow configurations and the spatial distributions of various types of vehicles are analyzed, when the mixed traffic flow is in equilibrium. To model the mixed traffic flow with platoons of ICVs, the intelligent driver model and the PATH laboratory-calibrated cooperative adaptive cruise control model are introduced for capturing the car-following behavior in this study. Then, analytical methods for the stability and the fundamental diagram models of mixed traffic flow are developed. The results of the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that ICVs can improve the stability of the mixed traffic flow under a critical speed. However, if this critical speed is exceeded, an increase in the number of ICVs may degrade the stability of the mixed traffic flow. Moreover, this critical speed decreases as the maximum platoon size increases. In addition to stability, the results suggest that ICVs can effectively improve traffic capacity. Moreover, the study results demonstrate that a decrease in the desired time headway and an increase in the maximum platoon size are advantageous for the efficiency of the mixed flow.

AB In this paper, a reinforcement learning (RL) fault-tolerant control (FTC) method is proposed for trajectory tracking of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with thruster faults. To deal with the thruster fault, unknown disturbance and model uncertainty, a new integral extended state observer (IESO) for fault diagnosis observation is proposed, which uses a conventional ESO to estimate the total system uncertainty, and introduces an integral mechanism to mitigate the effect of estimation error further. Thus, the problem that the estimation error caused by the traditional ESO leads to the decline of the fault-tolerant capability of the FTC system is solved. Then, to solve the problem of integral saturation due to the introduction of the integral term, the integral term is limited after the thruster fault of the AUV. Furthermore, based on the actor-critic structure of RL, a PD-like feedback controller is designed to realize the FTC of AUV in the face of thruster fault by using the total uncertainty of the IESO scheme. And the input saturation of the thruster is considered, and an auxiliary variable system is used to handle the control truncation between saturated and unsaturated inputs. Based on the Lyapunov method, the stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed and proved. Finally, the proposed method is verified to have good fault tolerance and robustness by simulation and underwater experiments.

AB The application of miniature underwater robots in the marine area is becoming more extensive. Occasionally, the ability of the single miniature underwater robot is limited by its size, configuration, function or propulsion method. At this moment, if a group of robots can work together in a division of labor, that can solve more problems underwater. For autonomous underwater vehicles, the support of underwater wireless communication equipment is required to achieve communication and collaboration. Acoustic communication equipment has generally been used in large underwater vehicles due to its large size and power. This article employs a small acoustic communication module to enable underwater communication in a spherical robot with a diameter of only 45 cm. The fourth-generation spherical underwater robot is exploited as the prototype. The article also verifies the accuracy, efficiency and timeliness of the proposed underwater communication systems. Finally, a cooperative mode is established based on the base station, master robot and slave robots, and some cooperation motion experiments are carried out to verify its effectiveness. Early work on this article was presented at the IEEE ICMA 2018 conference S. Gu et al., 2018. In this conference article, the authors only provided theoretical research and a small number of experiments. On this basis, this article has conducted in-depth research, proposed a base station-mater-slave robot communication mode, and established an instruction set for further experiments.

AB Human-machine shared control has become an effective cutting-edge approach to enhance driving safety and assist in the transition from manual to autonomous driving. However, driving authority allocation when conflict occurs between a human driver and a machine still represents an intractable problem. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes an adaptive steering torque coupling framework to achieve the human-machine shared control with conflict resolution. Additionally, a driver trajectory prediction method considering human-machine interaction is established based on the extended state observer and long short-term memory network. In addition, the human-machine shared steering system is modeled based on a non-cooperative dynamic game by the prediction model method for path-tracking, and the obtained solution is given according to the Nash equilibrium. Particularly, a dynamic load allocation approach is designed to resolve human-machine conflict and relax the driver. In order to verify the strategy formed based on the proposed framework, a driver-in-the-loop experiment is conducted. The experimental results reveal that the proposed strategy can effectively reduce the human-machine conflict torque and ensure a driver has absolute control authority. Furthermore, the proposed strategy can also transfer the driving workload between the driver and machine, provide driving experience, or improve driving comfort when there is no conflict.

ID UNCERTAINTY; SAFE
AB The path planning methods based on nonconvex constrained optimization, such as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), have found various important applications, ranging from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to space vehicles. Moreover, their stochastic extensions have enabled risk-aware path planning, which explicitly limits the probability of failure to a user-specified bound. However, a major challenge of those path planning methods is constraint violation between discrete time steps. In the existing approach, a path is represented by a sequence of waypoints and the safety constraints (e.g., obstacle avoidance) are imposed on waypoints. Therefore, the trajectory between waypoints could violate the safety constraints. A naive continuous-time extension results in unrealistic computation cost. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to ensure constraint satisfaction between waypoints without employing a continuous-time formulation. The key idea is to enforce that the same inequality constraint is satisfied on any two adjacent time steps, under assumptions of polygonal obstacles and straight line trajectory between waypoints. The resulting problem encoding is MILP, which can be solved efficiently by commercial solvers. Thus, we also introduce novel extensions to risk-allocation path planners with improved scalability for real-world scenarios and run-time performance. While the proposed encoding approach is general, the particular emphasis of this paper is placed on the chance-constrained, nonconvex path-planning problem (CNPP). We provide extensive simulation results on CNPP to demonstrate the path safety and scalability of our encoding and related path planners.

AB Federated learning (FL), as a distributed machine learning technology, allows large-scale nodes to utilize local datasets for model training and sharing without revealing privacy, which has significant efficiency and advantages in artificial intelligence (AI)-based knowledge sharing of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). However, for FL, there are challenges to ensure the security of knowledge, deal with the lazy behavior of participants, and enforce effective incentives. To bridge the gaps, in this paper, we first propose a hierarchical blockchain-supported FL architecture that utilizes the immutable and transparent properties of blockchain to enable secure storage and sharing of knowledge and transaction information with scalability. Then, considering the cost and laziness of the participants in the FL process, we propose an incentive mechanism combined with the supervision game to attract high-quality participants based on a comprehensive evaluation of model quality and participants' reputation. Extensive simulation results validate that our proposal can improve learning accuracy and efficiency while ensuring security.

AB Underwater autonomous manipulation is the capability of a mobile robot to perform intervention tasks that require physical contact with unstructured environments without continuous human supervision. Being difficult to assess the behaviour of existing motion planner algorithms, this research proposes a new planner evaluation metric to identify well-behaved planners for specialized tasks of inspection and monitoring of man-made underwater structures. This metric is named NEMU and combines three different performance indicators: effectiveness, safety and adaptability. NEMU deals with the randomization of sampling-based motion planners. Moreover, this article presents a benchmark of multiple planners applied to a 6 DoF manipulator operating underwater. Results conducted in real scenarios show that different planners are better suited for different tasks. Experiments demonstrate that the NEMU metric can be used to distinguish the performance of planners for particular movement conditions. Moreover, it identifies the most promising planner for collision-free motion planning, being a valuable contribution for the inspection of maritime structures, as well as for the manipulation procedures of autonomous underwater vehicles during close range operations.

AB Do people want autonomous machines making moral decisions? Nine studies suggest that that the answer is 'no'-in part because machines lack a complete mind. Studies 1-6 find that people are averse to machines making morally-relevant driving, legal, medical, and military decisions, and that this aversion is mediated by the perception that machines can neither fully think nor feel. Studies 5-6 find that this aversion exists even when moral decisions have positive outcomes. Studies 7-9 briefly investigate three potential routes to increasing the acceptability of machine moral decision-making: limiting the machine to an advisory role (Study 7), increasing machines' perceived experience (Study 8), and increasing machines' perceived expertise (Study 9). Although some of these routes show promise, the aversion to machine moral decision-making is difficult to eliminate. This aversion may prove challenging for the integration of autonomous technology in moral domains including medicine, the law, the military, and self-driving vehicles.

AB The present investigation focuses on one aspect of the autonomous targeting process used onboard during the Orion trans-Earth injection phase, specifically, a fast and robust algorithm that identifies a feasible return trajectory, one that meets the entry constraints without exceeding the fuel available. Unlike earlier Apollo missions, Orion seeks to land near the polar regions of the moon. Thus, a substantial plane change maneuver is required before returning to Earth. To reduce the fuel expenditure associated with this plane change, a three-maneuver sequence is employed during the return phase. An autonomous onboard targeting process for precision entry (one that incorporates multiple coordinated trans-Earth maneuvers) is sought in the event of loss of communication with the ground. The latter scenario presents a very unique challenge: one never before required of any Apollo vehicle. The Apollo missions also benefited from flexible entry requirements in contrast to Orion. Precision targeting in multibody regimes has only been previously demonstrated in unmanned sample return missions such as Genesis. The formulation presented here ensures that the entry constraints are met without violating the available fuel budget.

AB Deep learning and machine learning (ML) technologies have been implemented in various applications, and various agriculture technologies are being developed based on image-based object recognition technology. We propose an orchard environment free space recognition technology suitable for developing small-scale agricultural unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) autonomous mobile equipment using a low-cost lightweight processor. We designed an algorithm to minimize the amount of input data to be processed by the ML algorithm through low-resolution grayscale images and image binarization. In addition, we propose an ML feature extraction method based on binary pixel quantification that can be applied to an ML classifier to detect free space for autonomous movement of UGVs from binary images. Here, the ML feature is extracted by detecting the local-lowest points in segments of a binarized image and by defining 33 variables, including local-lowest points, to detect the bottom of a tree trunk. We trained six ML models to select a suitable ML model for trunk bottom detection among various ML models, and we analyzed and compared the performance of the trained models. The ensemble model demonstrated the best performance, and a test was performed using this ML model to detect apple tree trunks from 100 new images. Experimental results indicate that it is possible to recognize free space in an apple orchard environment by learning using approximately 100 low-resolution grayscale images.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have been the subject of extensive research in recent years and are expected to completely transform the operation of transport networks and revolutionize the automotive industry in the coming decades. Modeling detailed interactions among vehicles with varying levels of penetration rates is essential for evaluating the potential effects. One such investigation is being performed within the 'HumanDrive' Project in the U.K. This work has required the development of a behavioral model that incorporates microscopic level interactions and has been based on a pre-existing adaptive cruise control and lane-changing model that has been adapted to better replicate the limitations of AVs and allow the investigation of differing levels of intelligence or assertiveness. The model has been implemented on the M1 Motorway near Sheffield in the U.K. This has allowed the investigation of the effects of AVs on the operation of a real network under various traffic conditions where the overall effects may be revealed, both as advantages to AV drivers, and potentially disadvantages to non-AV traffic. Additionally, it has been possible to examine how these affect junction operations and net emissions. Preliminary results have allowed us to quantify the positive effects of AVs which increase with the penetration. However, it is clear that there are points of inflection where benefits start to slow. It is at these (high) penetration rates that initial operational assumptions may become increasingly stretched and additional infrastructure and cooperative systems are likely to have to become prevalent.

AB Collision avoidance for robots and vehicles in unpredictable environments is a challenging task. Various control strategies have been developed for the agent (i.e., robots or vehicles) to sense the environment, assess the situation, and select the optimal actions to avoid collision and accomplish its mission. In our research on autonomous ships, we take a machine learning approach to collision avoidance. The lack of available ship steering data of human ship masters has made it necessary to acquire collision avoidance knowledge through reinforcement learning (RL). Given that the learned neural network tends to be a black box, it is desirable that a method is available which can be used to design an agent's behavior so that the desired knowledge can be captured. Furthermore, RL with complex tasks can be either time consuming or unfeasible. A multi-stage learning method is needed in which agents can learn from simple tasks and then transfer their learned knowledge to closely related but more complex tasks. In this paper, we explore the ways of designing agent behaviors through tuning reward functions and devise a transfer RL method for multi-stage knowledge acquisition. The computer simulation-based agent training results have shown that it is important to understand the roles of each component in a reward function and the various design parameters in transfer RL. The settings of these parameters are all dependent on the complexity of the tasks and the similarities between them.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; PREFERENCES; IMPACT
AB The coming of automated vehicles (AVs) and Mobility-on-Demand (MoD services) is expected to reduce urban parking demand and correspondingly alter the urban parking landscape in a significant way. Multiple modeling efforts have already demonstrated that Shared AVs (SAVs) have promising potential to decrease urban parking demand. However, previous studies have only examined SAV parking demand at one point in time, with various market penetrations. It remains unclear what the demand reduction trajectory will be like during the transition period when there is a mix of SAVs, Privately-Owned AVs (PAVs), Shared Conventional Vehicles (SCVs), and Conventional Private Vehicles (CPVs). This study fills this gap by developing an agent-based simulation model to examine the spatially and temporally explicit parking reduction trends with mixed travel modes from 2020-2040. The results indicate that in the most optimal AV and MoD adoption scenario, the parking demand will decrease by over 20% after 2030, especially in core urban areas. Meanwhile, the parking demand in residential zones may double, which could lead to transportation equity concerns. Additionally, parking relocation may also induce environmental issues by generating a considerable amount of empty Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT). To reap the benefits brought by AVs and MoD systems and to mitigate the accompanying social and environmental issues, our results suggest that proactive policymakers in the next decade will need to modify land use regulations for both new developments and existing parking infrastructure in commercial and residential zones, as well as update travel demand management policies.

AB Objective: Autonomous vehicles (Avs) have paved the way for the arrangement of swivel seats in vehicles, which could pose a challenge to traditional safety systems. The integration of automated emergency braking (AEB) and pre-pretension (PPT) seatbelts improves protection for a vehicle's occupant. The objective of this study is to explore the control strategies of an integrated safety system for swiveled seating orientations.
   Methods: Occupant restraints were examined in various seating configurations using a single-seat model with a seat-mounted seatbelt. Seat orientation was set at different angles, from -45 degrees to 45 degrees with 15 degrees increments. A pretension was used on the shoulder belt to represent an active belt force cooperating with AEB. A generic full frontal vehicle pulse of 20 mph was applied to the sled. The occupant's kinematics response under various integrated safety system control strategies was analyzed by extracting a head pre-crash kinematics envelope. The injury values were calculated for various seating directions with or without an integrated safety system at the collision speed of 20 mph.
   Results: In a lateral movement, the excursions of the dummy head were 100 mm and 70mm in the global coordinate system for negative and positive seat orientations, respectively. In the axial movement, the head traveled 150 mm and 180mm in the global coordinate system for positive and negative seating directions, respectively. The 3-point seatbelt did not restrain the occupant symmetrically. The occupant experienced greater y-axis excursion and smaller x-axis excursion in the negative seat position. Various integrated safety system control strategies led to significant differences in head movement in the y direction. The integrated safety system reduced the occupant's potential injury risks in different seating positions. When the AEB and PPT were activated, the absolute HIC15, brain injury criteria (BrIC), neck injury (Nij), and chest deflection were reduced in most seating directions. However, the pre-crash increased the injury risks at some seating positions.
   Conclusion: The pre-pretension seatbelt could reduce the occupant's forward movement in the rotating seat positions in a pre-crash period. The occupant's precrash motion envelope was generated, which could be beneficial to future restraint systems and vehicle interior design. The integrated safety system could reduce injuries in different seating orientations.

AB This paper used an implementation of the land-use model SILO in Austin, Texas, over a 27-year period with an aim to understand the impacts of the full adoption of self-driving vehicles on the region's residential land use. SILO was integrated with MATSim for the Austin region. Land-use and travel results were generated for a business-asusual case (BAU) of 0% self-driving or "autonomous" vehicles (AVs) over the model timeframe versus a scenario in which households' value of travel time savings (VTTS) was reduced by 50% to reflect the travel-burden reductions of no longer having to drive. A third scenario was also compared and examined against BAU to understand the impacts of rising vehicle occupancy (VO) and/or higher roadway capacities due to dynamic ride-sharing (DRS) options in shared AV (SAV) fleets. Results suggested an 8.1% increase in average work-trip times when VTTS fell by 50% and VO remained unaffected (the 100% AV scenario) and a 33.3% increase in the number of households with "extreme work-trips" (over 1 hour, each way) in the final model year (versus BAU of 0% AVs). When VO was raised to 2.0 and VTTS fell instead by 25% (the "HiDRS" SAV scenario), average work-trip times increased by 3.5% and the number of households with "extreme work-trips" increased by 16.4% in the final model year (versus BAU of 0% AVs). The model also predicted 5.3% fewer households and 19.1% more available, developable land in the city of Austin in the 100% AV scenario in the final model year relative to the BAU scenario's final year, with 5.6% more households and 10.2% less developable land outside the city. In addition, the model results predicted 5.6% fewer households and 62.9% more available developable land in the city of Austin in the Hi-DRS SAV scenario in the final model year relative to the BAU scenario's final year, with 6.2% more households and 9.9% less developable land outside the city.

AB We propose in this paper a novel activity-based bi-level mathematical model to study theinteraction between one-way car-sharing services and travel demand as well as their impacts ona multi-modal network performance. At the upper level, car-sharing operators decide the priceof service and the plan of relocating shared vehicles among the depots. At the lower level,driven by their own activities, the decision of travelers is made bases on the equilibrium choiceof routes and associated transport modes that include private cars, public transport and sharedcars. Furthermore, we develop a scalable link-based method that is capable of solving large-scalenetwork with capacitated link flow. We show via numerical examples the impact of the one-way car-sharing services on both route choices and network performance, and demonstrate thesignificant improvements in the obtained solution both in terms of accuracy and computational complexity.

ID POWERED DESCENT GUIDANCE; CONVEX-OPTIMIZATION; TIME
AB Autonomous operation of rocket-powered vehicles is a promising technique that could significantly improve the adaptiveness of rocket-powered vehicles. However, to remedy in-flight engine failures and allow mission changes, the autonomous operation requires an onboard method to optimize the powered trajectories. While onboard methods to optimize the powered trajectories have been proposed before, none of them considered the constraints on duration of arcs in multi-arc trajectory optimization problems. The constraints on the duration of burn arcs and coast arcs often arise from the safe operating conditions of rocket engines, and violating these constraints will likely result in physically-infeasible trajectories. Determining the optimal duration of each arc while satisfying the constraints is a challenging problem for onboard trajectory optimization methods. In this paper, an onboard method to optimize multi-arc trajectories is proposed that is capable of enforcing the constraints on the duration of burn arcs and coast arcs. The proposed method employs a hybrid regularization approach to facilitate the convergence of the duration of arcs. Quadratic penalty terms and fixed-radius trust-region terms are simultaneously used to limit the change of duration of arcs between iterations. The two terms complement each other, contributing to the efficiency of the hybrid regularization approach. Moreover, we propose an optimality-based stopping criterion that certifies the optimality of optimized duration of arcs and helps reduce unnecessary iterations. Numerical results on an onboard computational platform are provided to validate the efficiency of the proposed method.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are an emerging and promising alternative for monitoring of transmission lines in terms of flexibility, complexity, working speed, and cost. One of the main challenges is to enable UAVs to become as autonomous as possible. A vital component toward this direction is the robust and accurate estimation of the UAV placement with respect to the transmission grid. This work faces this challenge by developing a transmission line autonomous tracking system, which allows the placement of a commercial drone over a transmission grid using a monocular camera. This feature provides accurate positioning for the vehicle even where the Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signal is denied, enabling to report the status of transmission lines, at any time. The system isolates transmission grid conductors in each acquired RGB-image using an image-processing algorithm based on Hough transform, morphological operations, and Gabor filters. With this information, the system computes the location of the UAV using a geometric approach that relates transmission lines building parameter and optical geometry. However, it has the problem of gradual error accumulation when the drone moves. In this regards, the estimated position of the drone is computed by the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) by the position information estimated by visual-system, the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and GNSS. The proposed positioning system showed an efficiency of 91.44% in field experimentation in the extraction of transmission conductor, with a root mean square the error of 0.18 m in the UAV localization.

AB Smart transportation is an autonomous arrangement that embodies technologically enabled intelligent vehicles and traffic systems to assist diverse real-time roadside applications and navigation. Intelligent Pervasive computing techniques with a common shared platform, such as the cloud, are employed to ease operations. This article introduces a Non-Divergent Traffic Management Scheme (NDTMS) to improve roadside driving for users and vehicles. This scheme recognizes and classifies traffic, neighbors, and environmental navigation data. Combining two inputs into the ecological data, the Pervasive computing systems assist in non-deviating seamless application support. The input data gives information regarding the traffic on roads and traffic density. The extracted data from the neighbors help in matching the data with features and reduces traffic. The problem of data mishandling for traffic management is addressed by classifier learning links to the application-specific requirements. This Pervasive computing technique operates on combinational data for precise traffic management through navigation/ alerts/ communications.

AB Automated Vehicles (AVs) must comply with traffic laws, including those requiring motorists to maintain safe distances when passing pedalcyclists. We review relevant U.S. legislation, statistics of traffic accidents in the U.S. resulting in pedalcyclists fatalities, and present "what if" scenarios for AV and pedalcyclist interactions to illustrate safety-preserving algorithms' necessary ethical considerations. We identify a need for pervasive cyclist identification to improve situational awareness and propose as a solution the concept of using AV-mounted Bluetooth receivers for identifying and localizing a pedalcyclist's "beaconing" Bluetooth device, e.g., a preexisting, low-cost performance monitoring system. This method estimates the distance-to-bicycle from the receivers' Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). Experimental results prove its feasibility for coarse pedalcyclist localization. Such a system may augment contemporary vision-based detection systems, thereby improving detection resilience and safety, particularly in dark or poor weather conditions.

AB In the recent past, the use of autonomous vehicles is becoming of relevant interest in several fields of application. In many cases, the use of articulated structures is preferred to single chassis robots for their peculiar modularity. Such vehicles are often built as an active front module and a rear one that is pulled passively or that can contribute to the vehicle traction when required. Understanding whether this contribution is convenient or not is the main matter of this paper. Two different mobile robots of different scales and purposes are taken into consideration. A dynamic model is presented and analyzed. An experimental validation of the model parameters is also presented in order to make it exploitable as a reliable analysis tool. At last, a simple yet effective actuation law is tested for both the considered robots to evaluate whether the contribution of the back module is beneficial or not to the whole machine maneuverability.

AB In contrast to rigid body autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) models, elastic AUV models will exhibit hydrodynamic effects due to elastic deformation of the shell during water entry, influencing their load-response characteristics. In this paper, the predictive capability of the selected simulation method is first verified by comparing the simulation results with test data acquired from experiments conducted in a drop-test tank. Then, the effects of the head shape parameters, shell thickness and water-entry state, such as the water-entry velocity and angle, on the acceleration, pressure, stress and structural deformation of an elastic AUV during water-entry impact are investigated. By comparing the characteristics of rigid and elastic bodies, the influence of the hydroelastic effect is revealed. The research results can provide guidance on the design of airborne vehicles and transmedia vehicles. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we propose a P300 brain-computer interface (BCI) with visual stimuli presented on a head-up display and we apply this BCI for selecting destinations of a simulated vehicle in a virtual scene. To improve the usability of the selection system, we analyze the effects of the number of electroencephalogram (EEG) rounds on system performance. Experimental results from eight participants show that the BCI-based model of destination selection can be built with EEG data from eight channels, and participants can use this BCI to select a desired destination with an accuracy value of 93.6% +/- 1.6% (mean value with standard error) in about 12 s of selection time. This paper lays a foundation for developing vehicles that use a BCI to select a desired destination from a list of predefined destinations and then use an autonomous navigation system to reach the desired destination.

AB In China, vehicles with L2 driving automation are already widespread, while L3-L5 automated vehicles (AVs) are not allowed on the road. Surprisingly, crashes involving vehicles with L2 driving automation contributed to the public's discussion of L3-L5 AVs. Understanding the variations in public perception of AVs is imperative, which could significantly affect the future evolution of AVs. Respondents have few opportunities to express their views freely in survey-based studies relying on structured questionnaires (e.g., Likert scale). We collected 42,111 comments from Chinese mainstream social media platforms (Sina Weibo and Tik Tok) in August 2021 and applied advanced text mining technology (Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model, text network analysis, and sentiment analysis) to understand variations in public perception of AVs before and after the crashes. The results show that the public expresses more blame for vehicles with L2 driving automation than human drivers and has misunderstandings about the current development of L3-L5 AVs, which is closely connected with publicity from automobile companies and media. Women were more negative than men both before and after the crash, and the sentiment difference was most significant in the first three days of the crash. This research provides new ideas for a timely understanding of the public perception of AVs. Findings contribute to specific policy recommendations to help in the technological change and wider adoption of AVs.

AB Eco-driving offers potential to reduce fuel use and emission rates for light-duty gasoline vehicles (LDGVs). The objective is to quantify real-world route-level and segment-level fuel use and emission rates reduction potential for LDGV eco-driving. Three million seconds of real-world speed trajectory data were analyzed based on predominantly naturalistic driving of 160 drivers on eight mesoscale routes. The routes were further divided into 199 segments. A Vehicle Specific Power modal model was used to estimate trajectory-average fuel use and emission rates of CO2, CO, hydrocarbons, NOx, and particulate matter and to identify eco-driving trajectories. For route -level eco-driving, fuel use and emission rates reduction potential ranges from 6% to 40%, compared to average fuel use and emission rates estimated based on all trajectories. Eco-driving focused on fuel savings typically reduced air emissions and vice versa. Route-level eco-driving typically but not always concurrently reduces segment-level fuel use and emission rates. These co -benefits and tradeoffs can be used to guide LDGV eco-driving decisions.

AB Target tracking and estimation using teams of unmanned aerial vehicles is essential to achieving autonomous drone systems. However, one problem that degrades target estimation is the limitation of the chosen motion model to fully represent the target's motion, especially in the case of an evasive target. This paper presents the use of multiple models as a strategy for a team of unmanned aerial vehicles to track a target of unknown behaviour. It combines the T Test criteria in a novel manner for model selection with a distributed extended Kalman filter. The algorithm is validated in both simulation and live indoor trials with a team unmanned aerial vehicles and an evasive target. Results show that using multiple models with the T Test outperforms the traditional single model methods as well as other commonly used approaches, such as the interacting multiple model and maximum likelihood methods. Furthermore, the distributed nature of the drone system provides for robust estimation, as demonstrated in live tests with occlusions present.

AB To solve the consistency problem in local path planning, the traditional definition of topological maps is extended in this paper, by introducing a new concept of local cognitive maps (LCMs). Principal structures of a local environment including all possible routes, key obstacles, and mutual relationships among them are incorporated. Based on the LCMs, the consistency of local path planning can be guaranteed, by keeping the relationship between the chosen route and key obstacles in sequential planning cycles as consistent as possible. To generate the LCMs, an iterative decomposition method is designed . Furthermore, to evaluate candidate routes in the LCMs, the model predictive control (MPC) based on a vehicle-road evaluation method and vehicle dynamics is incorporated. The optimal route is chosen based on the MPC simulation results with criterions, such as the spending time and route width. The final path for vehicles to follow is also achieved with the simulation results. To verify the performance of the proposed method, experiments in various kinds of environments were carried out. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.

AB Precision agriculture, such as precise seeding or ploughing, is guaranteed by vehicle navigation accuracy. A steering angle plays an essential and fundamental role in the function of autonomous vehicle and the path planning because it controls the vehicle direction. However, the steering angle cannot be calibrated directly from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) due to the limitation of GNSS parameters. In addition, the accuracy of steering angle obtained from the analysis of Global Position System (GPS) information cannot satisfy the accuracy requirements in engineering applications. In this paper, a novel approach to improve accuracy of steering angle is proposed. Low-cost Micro-electromechanical System (MEMS) and GPS are combined on an agriculture vehicle so that the steering angle can be calculated precisely. Unscented Kalman Filters (UKF) are used in simulations to estimate the steering angle. The simulation and experiment results show that the proposed method can achieve increased accuracy of estimation of steering angle than that based merely on GPS information. Because the cost of a MEMS gyroscope is very low, the proposed method is a practical way to achieve precision agriculture with high accuracy.

AB The paper presents a new generative neuro-evolutionary method called augmenting modular neural networks (AMNN). As the name of the method implies, its purpose is to construct neural networks with a modular architecture. In addition to the modularity itself, neural networks evolving according to AMNN are also characterized by gradually expanding architecture. In the beginning of the evolutionary process, all networks consist of only output modules (or a single module). After some time, if the architecture of all networks is insufficient to effectively perform a task, all of them are augmented by one hidden module. In the following generations, further hidden modules are also added and this procedure is continued until some stopping criterion is satisfied. To test performance of AMNN, the method was used to evolve neuro-controllers for a team of underwater vehicles whose common goal was to capture other vehicle behaving by a deterministic strategy (predator-prey problem). The experiments were carried out in simulation, whereas their results were used to compare AMNN with neuro-evolutionary methods designed for building monolithic neural networks.

AB The parking system is a vital element within intelligent transport systems, playing a pivotal role in alleviating traffic congestion and mitigating associated stress and anxiety. In response to evolving operational requirements, specialized parking systems such as autonomous valet parking (AVP) and smart parking systems (SPS) are employed based on the specific characteristics of vehicles. This research endeavor begins by introducing a loosely connected middleware designed to accommodate a variety of vehicles within a unified parking area. While the automatic parking system is designed for automated vehicles, and the manual parking system caters to manually operated vehicles, both systems lack the ability to effectively manage both automatic and manual vehicles. To address this challenge, a middleware solution is introduced, which acts as an intermediary layer between vehicles and the parking system. This middleware consists of various modules, enabling the seamless entry of all vehicle types into parking areas, regardless of classification or mode of operation. Second, it uses the Markov Chain model to determine the enhancement in the usability of the parking system after the incorporation of the middleware. Lastly, the suggested loosely coupled middleware approach is compared with tightly coupled smart parking approaches like automatic and manual systems. The matrices of assessment evaluated showed that the recommended scheme outperform its predecessors. In addition, it demonstrated remarkable achievement in terms of cost function, space availability (70%), and traffic jam reduction (56%). The advocated middleware, apart from keeping smooth traffic flow, assists in fulfilling the dire need for parking areas.

AB We are introducing an innovative networking approach to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) for their automation and orchestration by redesigning the wireless edge framework. To this end, we propose to expand the Software Defined Networking (SDN) functionality from the edge network to the cars, i.e. equipping our vehicles with mobile base stations having SDN capabilities. By adopting such a novel approach, most of the impending IoV automation and orchestration challenges are ameliorated, which has been extremely difficult and non-trivial to tackle by using standard existing approaches. The three primary challenges identified in this context are a) the scalability of the network of connected autonomous vehicles, b) the desirable security of the IoV data networking, and c) the flexibility of quality of experience (QoE) perceived by the vehicles. To tackle the aforementioned three challenges, we design a policy-driven framework for a secure and efficient IoV networking paradigm and then investigate its performance via analytic modeling. More importantly, from the IoV data networking perspective, we design an intent-based flow offloading scheme to facilitate enhanced and adjustable QoE. Furthermore, we develop a rigorous analysis to quantify the efficiency of the proposed SDN-capable IoV data networking by modeling TCP connections over WiFi. Using mathematics as a tool for reasoning the three key challenges, our feasibility analysis is validated with extensive simulations. Finally, we provide new insights by deriving the stability conditions for the data flow dynamics of the proposed approach.

AB Safe deployment of self-driving cars (SDC) necessitates thorough simulated and in-field testing. Most testing techniques consider virtualized SDCs within a simulation environment, whereas less effort has been directed towards assessing whether such techniques transfer to and are effective with a physical real-world vehicle. In this paper, we shed light on the problem of generalizing testing results obtained in a driving simulator to a physical platform and provide a characterization and quantification of the sim2real gap affecting SDC testing. In our empirical study, we compare SDC testing when deployed on a physical small-scale vehicle versus its digital twin. Due to the unavailability of driving quality indicators from the physical platform, we use neural rendering to estimate them through visual odometry, hence allowing full comparability with the digital twin. Then, we investigate the transferability of behavior and failure exposure between virtual and real-world environments, targeting both unintended abnormal test data and intended adversarial examples. Our study shows that, despite the usage of a faithful digital twin, there are still critical shortcomings that contribute to the reality gap between the virtual and physical world, threatening existing testing solutions that only consider virtual SDCs. On the positive side, our results present the test configurations for which physical testing can be avoided, either because their outcome does transfer between virtual and physical environments, or because the uncertainty profiles in the simulator can help predict their outcome in the real world.

   Authors are encouraged to provide a concise description of the specific application or a potential application of the work. This section is not mandatory.
   Time-synchronization technology can provide a common notion of time among the participating nodes on a network. This is essential not only for protocol operation for time-critical services but also for the time stamp for information included in the message. Precise time information can be very crucial for such things as autonomous driving because there are various sensor measurements from multiple cameras, and radio detection and ranging (radar) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) are used for perceiving the current situation via sensor fusion. A well-known synchronization method, IEEE 1588, denoted as the precision time protocol (PTP), can be used for various applications. For in-vehicle networks of autonomous cars, we have to consider that the network may be comprised of subnetworks based on different protocols such as controller area network (CAN) and Ethernet. However, implementing PTPs on such heterogeneous vehicle networks causes several problems. First, the PTP procedure must be modified to be implement on a CAN network. Second, to calculate the delay and offset for PTP, the processing delay that occurs during message conversion must be considered. In this paper, we propose a synchronization method for CAN-Ethernet networks to solve these problems. The performance of the proposed synchronization method is evaluated by experiments on a real CAN-Ethernet network.

TI Influence of Lane Policies on Freeway Traffic Mixed with Manual and

ID ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; CAPACITY; IMPACT
AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have become the highlights of traffic. Researchers in this field have proposed various traffic management measures to enhance the capacity and efficiency of traffic with CAVs, especially mixed traffic of CAVs and manual vehicles (MVs). Exclusive lane setting is included. However, exclusive lane policy-related researches for mixed traffic of CAVs and MVs were very limited, and the influence of number and location of exclusive lanes on the mixed traffic was unclear. To fill this gap, this paper aims to study the influence of different exclusive lane policies on mixed traffic and provide recommended lane policies under various traffic volumes and CAV penetration rates. Freeways with two lanes and three lanes in a single direction were taken into consideration, and sixteen lane policies were proposed. Then different lane policies were simulated with a new proposed cellular automata (CA) model, and properties including flux, average speed, and CAVs degradation were analyzed to evaluate the traffic efficiency of each lane policy. The results show that CAV exclusive lanes can improve the capacity, while MV exclusive lanes seem helpless for capacity improvement. Seven lane policies, including GC, GM, and CM for two-lane freeways and GCG, CGC, and CCM for three-lane freeways, outperform the others in terms of average speed. In addition, exclusive lanes can reduce the probability that CAVs degenerate to AVs. Our findings may help to optimize freeways' lane policies and improve the efficiency of heterogeneous traffic mixed with CAVs and MVs.

AB Autonomous marine surface vehicles rely on computer systems with computer intelligence making decisions to assist or replace the navigating officer. A fundamental requirement for the design and implementation of such a cyber-physical system is seamless, predictable, and secure interoperability between vendor-specific hardware and software subsystems. The article describes a system design that includes mechanisms to mitigate the risks and consequences of software defects, individual component malfunction, and harmful cyber interference. It addresses international regulations in the field and demonstrates a system design that can meet the requirements for safe behaviour in foreseeable events while also having the ability to call for human assistance if the autonomous system is unable to handle a situation. The paper presents a design for highly automated vessels with several inherent risk-reducing features, including the ability to isolate and encapsulate abnormal behaviours, built-in features to support resilience to unexpected events, and mechanisms for internal defence against cyber-attacks. The article shows how this is provided by a novel middleware that supports risk mitigation, dependability, and resilience.

AB This paper presents a sophisticated vision-aided flocking system for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which is able to operate in GPS-denied unknown environments for exploring and searching missions, and also able to adopt two types of vision sensors, day and thermal cameras, to measure relative motion between UAVs in different lighting conditions without using wireless communication. In order to realize robust vision-aided flocking, an integrated framework of tracking-learning-detection on the basis of multifeature coded correlation filter has been developed. To achieve long-term tracking, a redetector is trained online to adaptively reinitialize target for global sensing. An advanced flocking strategy is developed to address the autonomous multi-UAVs' cooperative flight. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-based navigation modules are developed for autonomous localization, mapping, and obstacle avoidance. Flight experiments of a team of UAVs have been conducted to verify the performance of this flocking system in a GPS-denied environment. The extensive experiments validate the robustness of the proposed vision algorithms in challenging scenarios.

AB The possibility of replacing the existing autonomous thermal power plants by Distributed Energy Resources (DER) based on renewable energy sources (RES), along with the appropriate energy storage technologies in order to deal with the major problems that autonomous islands usually face was investigated. A case study of a small Greek island, which is confronted by various energy and water shortages, was studied for assessing the feasibility of DER deployment. The main objectives investigated were cost minimization, CO2 emissions minimization and DER reliability maximization. The DER-CAM (Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model) decision support tool was used for the multi-objective analysis conducted, which proposes a set of optimal solutions defining the appropriate Distributed Generation (DG) technologies, the capacities of storage and other technologies and the optimal dispatch of the DG system. A mutual beneficial solution, for all stakeholders, was proposed indicating the scope for developing such systems for all islands facing the same problems.

AB The capability of detecting and identifying obstacles on the expected path and taking appropriate collision avoidance actions automatically is critical for safe operation of autonomous agricultural vehicles. This article presents an obstacle detection and identification algorithm for an on-tractor laser range finder-based obstacle detector This algorithm consists of a template matching function and a Kalman filter for detecting the location of an obstacle, reconstructing the silhouette of the detected obstacle, and estimating its relative motions. Field validation test results verified that this obstacle detector was capable of detecting a moving object within a semicircle of 8 in radius and reconstructing a 2D silhouette of the obstacle progressively in real time. The errors of this obstacle detector in estimating the position, speed, and moving direction of the obstacle relative to the tractor were 0.052 in, 0.11 in s(-1), and 1.2 degrees, respectively. Such accuracies are sufficient for providing safety warning and collision avoidance for autonomous tractors infield operation.

AB In this paper, an adaptive model-free optimal reinforcement learning (RL) neural network (NN) control scheme based on filter error is proposed for the trajectory tracking control problem of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with input saturation. Generally, the optimal control is realized by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. However, due to its inherent nonlinearity and complexity, the HJB equation of AUV dynamics is challenging to solve. To deal with this problem, an RL strategy based on an actor-critic framework is proposed to approximate the solution of the HJB equation, where actor and critic NNs are used to perform control behavior and evaluate control performance, respectively. In addition, for the AUV system with the second-order strict-feedback dynamic model, the optimal controller design method based on filtering errors is proposed for the first time to simplify the controller design and accelerate the response speed of the system. Then, to solve the model-dependent problem, an extended state observer (ESO) is designed to estimate the unknown nonlinear dynamics, and an adaptive law is designed to estimate the unknown model parameters. To deal with the input saturation, an auxiliary variable system is utilized in the control law. The strict Lyapunov analysis guarantees that all signals of the system are semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Finally, the superiority of the proposed method is verified by comparative experiments.& COPY; 2022 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Encrypted Transfer of Traffic Sign Information for Advanced Driving
   Assistance Systems Using Invisible Security Patches
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article

AB Adversarial attacks pose serious traffic safety risks that could potentially impede the deployment of automated driving systems (ADS). Recent discoveries show that imperceptible perturbations (also referred to as adversarial attacks) to inputs of deep neural networks employed in these systems could impair their image recognition and prediction capabilities. Adversarial attacks can misguide advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS) to misclassify a traffic sign (e.g., classify a stop sign as a speed limit sign), causing the vehicle to accelerate instead of stop, which may potentially result in catastrophic incidents. This paper investigates encrypted invisible security patches placed on traffic signs and an onboard machine-vision system that can be integrated into the ADAS (i.e., ADS and cooperative adaptive cruise control systems). The security patches are essentially a visual representation of encrypted hash values generated via a one-way cryptographic algorithm. In this way, every traffic sign will be associated with a unique security pattern that can only be recognized by the proposed machine-vision technology. Additionally, these patches will be made invisible with the help of ultraviolet reflective sign technology. The proposed methodology aims to bring an additional security layer to sign recognition to enhance the reliability of ADAS. If a traffic sign is physically altered to attempt an adversarial threat, the security patch on the sign will not match with the sign information, and the driver will receive a warning to take control of the driving. For self-driving vehicles, a signal will be sent to the autonomous vehicle to enforce a safe driving action.

AB High-speed wireless network technologies play a vital role in autonomous vehicle communication systems (AVS), i.e., IoV (Internet of Vehicles), and enhance the effectiveness and reliability of the communication network. Since the size of IoV communication is rapidly growing, it is now an essential part of our regular routines. Due to its dynamic nature and massive size, it is essential to avoid any miss-communication and protect the data privacy of each vehicle.IoVallowsAVS to link remotely to each other and to various platforms and groups that may be using the same com-munications system. This quality link between vehicles and the need for information exchanges among vehicles introduces vulnerability and threats that can be exploited by cybercriminals. This research emphasizes on enhancing data security in real-time IoV communication. It presents a trust-driven privacy method using encryption and steganography for IoV. This method uses an Efficient Algorithm for Secure Transmission (EAST) that integrates encryption and steganography algorithms. The proposed EAST is then compared to the various current state of arts, i.e., AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), DES (Data Encryption Standard), G-DES (Generalized DES), and Standard LSB on the basis of various performance measuring parameters, i.e., encryption and decryption time, efficiency, avalanche effect, PSNR, and file cover size. Experimental results are promising for the proposed EAST method, which reported a better time efficiency of 0.86 ms, avalanche effect of 58.81%, and PSNR of 78.58%, compared to the current state arts.

AB The multi-source visual information from ring cameras and stereo cameras provides a direct observation of the road, traffic conditions, and vehicle behavior. However, relying solely on visual information may not provide a complete environmental understanding. It is crucial for intelligent transportation systems to effectively utilize multi-source, multi-modal data to accurately predict the future motion trajectory of vehicles accurately. Therefore, this paper presents a new model for predicting multi-modal trajectories by integrating multi-source visual feature. A spatial-temporal cross attention fusion module is developed to capture the spatiotemporal interactions among vehicles, while leveraging the road's geographic structure to improve prediction accuracy. The experimental results on the realistic dataset Argoverse 2 demonstrate that, in comparison to other methods, ours improves the metrics of minADE (Minimum Average Displacement Error), minFDE (Minimum Final Displacement Error), and MR (Miss Rate) by 1.08%, 3.15%, and 2.14% , respectively, in unimodal prediction. In multimodal prediction, the improvements are 5.47%, 4.46%, and 6.50%. Our method effectively captures the temporal and spatial characteristics of vehicle movement trajectories, making it suitable for autonomous driving applications.

AB This study highlights a security scenario involving vehicles in a Traffic Management and Information System (TMIS) network. TMIS and its nodal architecture, nicknamed Intelligent Junction (IJ), are summarized from our recent work. System design sets an example to a software architecture implementing autonomous semantic agents through semantic web services, junction-based sensor networks, local- and wide-area networking through wire/wireless integrated communication infrastructure. It is so construed as to provide (near-) real-time services throughout the network. This introduction is with reference to the SOA of Cooperative Labyrinth Discovery Robotics and Traffic Management and Information System Projects. This also takes up several issues including real-time goal-oriented coordination of semantic web services. Especially described are its essential functions crucial to aid security applications. A security scenario concerning tracking and routing reported, say missing, vehicles is considered and shown how to graft it onto TMIS network. Simulation results show promising outcomes. Performance of the system in terms of mean response time is analytically derived. Simulation and analytical results agree. Research involving similar development base is suggested.

AB The safety and efficiency of the merging zone is particularly important for traffic networks. Although autonomous vehicle improves the safety and efficiency from vehicle view, traffic controlling in merging zone mostly focus on improving efficiency from roadside view. Lacking of detailed driving recommendation, it ignores the safety of merging zone where commercial vehicle pose a high collision risk in real traffic. This paper proposes a roadside decision-making methodology to simultaneously improve the safety and efficiency of merging zone. We have built two modules, namely assessment and decision-making. Assessment module takes advantage of Bayesian inference to evaluate dynamic collision risk. Decision-making module based on deep reinforcement learning recommends the actions to commercial vehicles by roadside unit. A series of typical simulation tests show that our method increases the TTC of commercial vehicles by an average of 62.7%. In the free flow, the overall travel time of vehicles in the merging zone is reduced by 11.68%. Most notably, when congestion occurred, the average jam length is reduced by 59.68% on the premise of safety. Moreover, the average accuracy of the roadside decision-making method on the evaluation metrics of TTC, travel time, and jam length are 93.73%, 91.65%, and 94.45%, respectively. The experimental results show that the roadside decision-making methodology simultaneously improves safety and efficiency, and it dynamically adapts free and congested traffic flow.

AB Lateral vehicle control is of high importance in automated vehicles as it directly influences the vehicle's performance and safety during operation. The linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller stands out due to its high-performance characteristics and is used in the open source for self-driving functions. However, a notable limitation of the current approach is the manual calibration of LQR controllers based on the experience and intuition of the designers, leading to empirical uncertainties. To address this issue and enhance the lateral control performance, this paper concentrates on refining the LQR by employing three optimization algorithms: artificial bee colony optimization (ABC), genetic algorithm (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO). These algorithms aim to overcome the reliance on empirical methods and enable a data-driven approach to LQR calibration. By comparing the outcomes of these optimization algorithms to the manual LQR controller within an offline multibody simulation as a testing platform, this study highlights the superiority of the best-performing optimization approach. Following this, the optimal algorithm is implemented on a real-time system for the full vehicle level, revealing the model-in-the-loop and the hardware-in-the-loop gap up to 78.89% with lateral velocity when we use the relative error criterion (REC) method to validate and 2.35 m with lateral displacement when considering the maximum absolute value method.

AB Autonomous vehicles produce high data rates of sensory information from sensing systems. To achieve the advantages of sensor fusion among different vehicles in a cooperative driving scenario, high data-rate communication becomes essential. Current strategies for joint radar-communication (JRC) often rely on specialized hardware, prior knowledge of the system model, and entail diminished capability in either radar or communication functions. In this paper, we propose a framework for intelligent vehicles to conduct JRC, with minimal prior knowledge of the system model and a tunable performance balance, in an environment where surrounding vehicles execute radar detection periodically, which is typical in contemporary protocols. We introduce a metric on the usefulness of data to help an intelligent vehicle decide what, and to whom, data should be transmitted. The problem framework is cast as a generalized form of the Markov Decision Process (MDP). We identify deep reinforcement learning algorithms (DRL) and algorithmic extensions suitable for solving our JRC problem. For multi-agent scenarios, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework via a control channel. This framework enables modular and fair comparisons of various algorithmic extensions. Our experiments show that DRL results in superior performance compared to non-learning algorithms. Learning of inter-agent coordination in the GNN framework, based only on the Markov task reward, further improves performance.

AB In this article, we develop a methodology for trajectory tracking control of a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the presence of unknown mass and time-varying external disturbances. A time-dependent shift function is introduced, which, alongside a set of barrier vector functions, enables a finite period of constrained outputs, namely, the position and velocity errors. The proposed controller also features two stable adaption laws to estimate the following: 1) the mass of the UAV and 2) a parameter relating to the bound of the external disturbances. The total closed-loop system error is shown to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). This proposed strategy, which requires only the first derivative of the reference trajectory and features an implicit saturation of the thrust force, is especially apt to handle three stages of flight: vertical takeoff, constrained trajectory tracking, and landing. Simulation results are presented to validate the proposed solution. Experimental results are also included to showcase the performance of our controller in a real-world application using a quadrotor vehicle.

AB Aiming at improving the performance of tracking an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on the battlefield, this article focuses on the algorithm involving tracking the maneuvering target with a distributed sensor network under non-Gaussian measurement noise. A novel distributed maximum correntropy cubature information filtering (DMCCIF) based on interactive multiple model (IMM) is proposed. Taking advantage of correntropy, we design maximum correntropy cubature information filtering (MCCIF) for each node to estimate the target state under non-Gaussian measurement noise. Then, distributed information fusion based on weighted average consensus is conducted to improve the stability of the sensor network. After that, the information pair is changed so that a distributed state estimation (DSE) algorithm based on IMM is developed to increase the reliability of the maneuvering target tracking. Simulation results and comparison with other algorithms in three typical non-Gaussian measurement noise scenarios are given to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB This article proposes a controlling framework for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to integrate the modes of formation flight and swarm deployment over fixed and switching topologies. Formation strategies enable UAVs to enjoy key collective benefits including reduced energy consumption, but the shape of the formation and each UAV's freedom are significantly restrained. Swarm strategies are thus proposed to maximize each UAV's freedom following simple yet powerful rules. This article investigates the integration and switch between these two strategies, considering the deployment environment factors, such as poor network conditions and unknown and often highly mobile obstacles. We design a distributed formation controller to guide multiple UAVs in orderless states to swiftly reach an intended formation. Inspired by starling birds and similar biological creatures, a distributed collision avoidance controller is proposed to avoid unknown and mobile obstacles. We further illustrated the stability of the controllers over both fixed and switching topologies. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the framework.

DE Articulated vehicle; anti-jackknife; automatic steering; path tracking
ID BACKING; SYSTEMS
AB It is well known that backward motion control of an articulated vehicle is difficult because it is an open loop unstable system and such motion is also dangerous due to 'jackknifing'. In this paper, an anti-jackknife reverse tracking control strategy for autonomous articulated vehicles is proposed based on the combined longitudinal and lateral control scheme. In the proposed lateral-longitudinal control scheme, the major task is to control the reverse heading of the trailer by automatic steering strategies that observe both the anti-jackknife condition and input limitations. The main contribution of this paper is the development of globally asymptotic anti-jackknife stabilising and tracking controls of heading angles with both state and input constraints considered a priori. The proposed control inherently has an anti-windup mechanism that prevents the hitch angle from going beyond any specified critical value to avoid jackknifing, during which time, the steering angle remains at its limit. Stability of the controller is theoretically proven via the Lyapunov argument. Effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by CarSim and Simulink joint simulations.

AB Automated driving in public traffic still faces many technical and legal challenges. However, automating vehicles at low speeds in controlled industrial environments is already achievable today. A reliable obstacle detection is mandatory to prevent accidents. Recent advances in convolutional neural network-based algorithms hypothetically allow the replacement of distance measuring laser scanners with common monocameras. In this paper, we present a photorealistic 3D simulated factory environment for testing vision-based obstacle detecting algorithms preceding field tests on the safety-critical system. We further test two obstacle detection methods employing state-of-the-art semantic segmentation and depth estimation in a range of challenging test scenarios. Both models performed well under common factory settings. Some edge cases, however, lead to vehicle crashes.

AB Accurate forecasting of future traffic is a critical contemporary problem for transportation research. However, it is difficult to understand the feature patterns of traffic events due to the complexity of the traffic environment, heterogeneous factors, and lack of abnormal samples. This article proposes a framework to integrate the social traffic data and use the TabNet model to facilitate the representation learning task in traffic event prediction. With the tabular learning and model interpretability analysis, the importance of common traffic external factors toward traffic events is studied. The study has practical significance for regulating traffic planning and the development of the operational boundary for autonomous driving systems.

AB This paper presents new concepts for a flexible transport system for industrial environments. In contrast to autonomous mobile systems, carrying all necessary sensors and computers on-board, MONAMOVE uses a global off-carrier sensor system in combination with global navigation. First, the principal differences between local and global approaches for mobile vehicles are discussed focusing on the special demands of industrial environments. One long-term goal is the simultaneous usage of computer-controlled carriers and man-guided vehicles, e.g. fork trucks, in the same working space. Subsequently, an overview about the transport system under development in our lab is given. The two main modules - the navigator and the monitoring system - are explained in detail.

AB Due to rapid advancements on the Internet of Things (IoT), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, are transforming numerous military and civil application areas. UAVs aim to enhance the production efficiency, ensure safety, and reduce risk, particularly protecting the human workforce in the case of harsh and dangerous environments. Due to the mission-critical, business-critical, or safety-critical nature of the UAV applications, it is pivotal that UAVs perform reliably to deliver the required service during the intended mission time. Therefore, reliability is one of the essential requirements for designing and operating UAVs. This article presents a critical review of UAV reliability literature in both theoretical and practical research, pinpointing failure causes and reliability challenges of UAV systems, classifying and reflecting on the reliability modeling, analysis, and design methods for UAV systems and key subsystems. Some open research problems and opportunities are also discussed to highlight potential new challenges for designing reliable and resilient UAVs and UAV-assisted IoT systems.

AB Automated vehicle technology is becoming increasingly mature with the development of Artificial Intelligence and information communications technology. It is important to understand the factors affecting the use of automated vehicles. This study investigates user acceptance and the willingness to use fully driverless cars (self-driving cars). Based on Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), we developed a new acceptance model to explore the impact of mass media on adopting self-driving cars. A survey was designed and distributed, and 173 responded. The results show that 84.4% of the respondents are willing to accept driverless cars. At this early stage, the reports from mass media significantly influence people's perception of self-driving cars. The media affect self-efficacy and subjective norms, and thereby people's trust and behavior change. Moreover, subjective norms, self-efficacy, and trust significantly influence their intention to use self-driving cars. This article provides practical guidance to promote self-driving cars: positive media reports will significantly enhance people's trust and intention to use driverless cars.

AB In this paper, a low-cost small-sized strap-down inertial navigation system (SINS)-Gyrolab GL-VG 109-is studied. When the system is installed on an unmanned vehicle and works in autonomous mode, it is difficult to determine the navigation parameters of the unmanned vehicle. Correcting the SINS information from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) can significantly increase the determination accuracy of the navigation parameters. However, this is only available when the GNSS signals are stable. A new adaptive estimation algorithm that can automatically detect, evaluate, and process the abnormal measurements is proposed in the present work. The determination of the navigation parameters can reach the third accuracy class using the proposed method. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by the mathematical simulation and the experimental tests (with a real SINS GL-VG 109), which are conducted in urban environments with a GNSS signal containing 15% and 40% abnormal measurements. The results show that the proposed method can significantly reduce the impact of abnormal measurements and improve the estimation accuracy.

AB One of the most relevant tasks in an intelligent vehicle navigation system is the detection of obstacles. It is important that a visual perception system for navigation purposes identifies obstacles, and it is also important that this system can extract essential information that may influence the vehicle's behavior, whether it will be generating an alert for a human driver or guide an autonomous vehicle in order to be able to make its driving decisions. In this paper we present an approach for the identification of obstacles and extraction of class, position, depth and motion information from these objects that employs data gained exclusively from passive vision. We use a convolutional neural network for the obstacles detection, optical flow for the analysis of movement of the detected obstacles, both in relation to the direction and in relation to the intensity of the movement, and also stereo vision for the analysis of distance of obstacles in relation to the vehicle. We performed our experiments on two different datasets, and the results obtained showed a good efficacy from the use of depth and motion patterns to assess the obstacles' potential threat status.

AB Facts proved that obeying traffic laws keeps the promise to promote the safety of self-driving vehicles. Current self-driving vehicles usually have fixed algorithms during autonomous driving, however the traffic laws may differ or change in different regions or times, e.g., tidal lanes. It raises a crucial requirement to make self-driving vehicles adapt to the newly received traffic laws. The challenges are that traffic laws are usually semantic and manually designed, but the original algorithms may not always contain the pre-designed interface to adapt to emerging laws. To this end, this work proposes a traffic law adaptive decision-making platform, which uses the linear temporal logic (LTL) formula to consistently describe the semantic traffic laws. Then, an LTL-based reinforcement learning framework is designed to estimate the probability of illegal behavior under different traffic laws. Finally, a law-specific backup policy is designed to maintain the performance threshold by monitoring the probability of illegal behavior. This work takes three typical scenarios where the traffic laws differ for instance to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach, i.e., law amendment presented by the government, law difference between different regions, and temporary traffic control. The results show that the proposed method can help the original decision-making algorithms adapt to the traffic laws well without pre-defined interfaces. This method provides a way to administer on-road driving self-driving vehicles.

AB Electric vehicles are currently gaining more attention in terms of mitigating the causes of climate change. Therefore, automakers as well as many governments have fostered EV adoption by policy incentives and new R&D strategies. However, the EV adoption rate remains low despite those efforts due to their relatively high prices, technical limitations, and low charging infrastructure availability compared to internal combustion engine vehicles. In this study, we analyzed consumer preferences on the attributes of EVs and conventional ICEVs. For the data collection, we conducted 350 face-to-face discrete choice surveys of residents of metropolitan areas in Korea, administered by Gallup Korea utilizing conjoint surveys. We utilized a mixed logit model and estimated the consumer preferences of EV attributes, including incorporating reference points to verify the prospect theory empirically. We also conducted market share simulations by differentiating the attribute levels considering the RP dependence to predict future EV market shares. The model found that fuel economy, purchase price, distance to charging station, driving range, charging time, and autonomous driving were all statistically significant. Additionally, we confirmed that the respondents had an asymmetrical preference for the purchase price in EV adoption by considering their previous vehicle purchase experience as an RP.

AB This paper provides details on best practices for vehicle design for BVLOS missions, with a focus on robust control links and real-time health monitoring.The development work presented herein focuses on a specific mission to set the speed and distance world record for a fully autonomous vehicle, requiring development of analytic tools for estimating vehicle range and endurance, as well as models for predicting command and control link integrity while operating BVLOS. Range and endurance estimates are developed using a novel real-time system identification algorithm onboard the vehicle for aerodynamic parameter estimation, and propulsion system characterization. Flight-testing methods and results are presented demonstrating the capabilities of these algorithms, with results from a unique test-case involving an unintended fault during the record flight. In addition to the vehicle performance assessment, Friis-based models are introduced to provide a pseudo real-time communications link range assessment. The predictive communications range models were refined using specific antenna and system characterization data measured in a compact range facility resulting in a detailed link budget useful for addressing BVLOS command and control requirements. The combination of aircraft and radio-frequency performance prediction models with supporting flight-testing techniques applied to small unmanned aerial systems provides critical insight into the design of future vehicles, and validation of existing systems tasked with performing BVLOS missions.

AB The genetic algorithm (GA) is an effective method to solve the path-planning problem and help realize the autonomous navigation for and control of unmanned surface vehicles. In order to overcome the inherent shortcomings of conventional GA such as population premature and slow convergence speed, this paper proposes the strategy of increasing the number of offsprings by using the multi-domain inversion. Meanwhile, a second fitness evaluation was conducted to eliminate undesirable offsprings and reserve the most advantageous individuals. The improvement could help enhance the capability of local search effectively and increase the probability of generating excellent individuals. Monte-Carlo simulations for five examples from the library for the travelling salesman problem were first conducted to assess the effectiveness of algorithms. Furthermore, the improved algorithms were applied to the navigation, guidance, and control system of an unmanned surface vehicle in a real maritime environment. Comparative study reveals that the algorithm with multi-domain inversion is superior with a desirable balance between the path length and time-cost, and has a shorter optimal path, a faster convergence speed, and better robustness than the others.

ID TRANSPORT; LEVEL
AB The need to future-proof road transport networks is becoming increasingly urgent in order to take full advantage of automated vehicles (AVs). It is now vital to understand the basic road infrastructure requirements of AVs in order to assess the readiness of the existing road network and prepare the roads for the safe operation of these vehicles. However, current literature on this subject is limited. As such this research seeks to understand the desired infrastructure-related requirements of highly automated vehicles (SAE Level 4) for safe operation based on a survey with experts and stakeholders. On the basis of 168 expert responses from 29 countries, this study presents stakeholders' views on: (1) deployment paths of Level 4 automated driving, (2) the concept of road certification for automated driving, (3) basic road infrastructure elements for the safe operation of automated driving, and (4) factors affecting safe operations of Level 4 automated driving. The findings show that different types of stakeholders (e.g. academics, infrastructure owners and operators, and vehicle and information technology developers) have broadly similar views on most criteria requiring consideration in the early stages of automated driving implementation. However, there is no clear consensus on issues regarding operating constraints on road networks and some are in favour of waiting for the technology to mature or until it proves beneficial to overall community goals and then acting on the infrastructure needs.

AB Intelligent manufacturing technologies have been pursued by the industries to establish an autonomous indoor manufacturing environment. It means that tasks, which are comprised in the desired manufacturing activities, shall be performed with exceptional human interventions. This entails the employment of automated resources (i.e. machines) and agents (i.e. robots) on the shop floor. Such an implementation requires a planning system which controls the actions of the agents and their interactions with the resources to accomplish a given set of tasks. A scheduling system which plans the task executions by scheduling the available unmanned aerial vehicles and automated guided vehicles is investigated in this study. The primary objective of the study is to optimize the schedule in a cost-efficient manner. This includes the minimization of makespan and total battery consumption; the priority is given to the schedule with the better makespan. A metaheuristic-based methodology called differential evolution-fused particle swarm optimization is proposed, whose performance is benchmarked with several data sets. Each data set possesses different weights upon characteristics such as geographical scale, number of predecessors, and number of tasks. Differential evolution-fused particle swarm optimization is compared against differential evolution and particle swarm optimization throughout the conducted numerical simulations. It is shown that differential evolution-fused particle swarm optimization is effective to tackle the addressed problem, in terms of objective values and computation time.

AB This article presents a novel approach to designing and validating a fully electronic braking pedal, addressing the growing integration of electronics in vehicles. With the imminent rise of brake-by-wire (BBW) technology, the brake pedal requires electronification to keep pace with industry advancements. This research explores technologies and features for the next-generation pedal, including low-power consumption electronics, cost-effective sensors, active adjustable pedals, and a retractable pedal for autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, this research brings the benefits of the water injection technique (WIT) as the base for manufacturing plastic pedal brakes towards reducing cost and weight while enhancing torsional stiffness. Communication with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) has provided valuable insights and feedback, facilitating a productive exchange of ideas. The findings include two sensor prototypes utilizing inductive technology and printed-ink gauges. Significantly, reduced power consumption was achieved in a Hall-effect sensor already in production. Additionally, a functional BBW prototype was developed and validated. This research presents an innovative approach to pedal design that aligns with current electrification trends and autonomous vehicles. It positions the braking pedal as an advanced component that has the potential to redefine industry standards. In summary, this research significantly contributes to the electronic braking pedal technology presenting the critical industry needs that have driven technical studies and progress in the field of sensors, electronics, and materials, highlighting the challenges that component manufacturers will inevitably face in the forthcoming years.

AB In this article, a scheme of anti-disturbance agile flight control is developed for a maneuverable quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle, subject to the aerodynamic drag, dynamic shift of center of gravity (CoG), and motor dynamics. A cascaded control framework is adopted. In the translational loop, an aerodynamic drag model that considers the drag surface change is developed, containing the deep coupling information between the aerodynamic drag and the system states. A disturbance observer based on the aerodynamic drag model is subsequently designed for suppressing the aerodynamic drag force. In the rotational loop, a full quaternion-based backstepping control is adopted and a nonlinear disturbance observer with consideration of motor dynamics is designed, which can handle the dynamic CoG shift and aerodynamic drag torque. Comparative studies on both simulations and experiments manifest that the agile ability can be ensured by the proposed control framework, especially in the presence of multiple disturbances.

DT Article
DE UAV; AUV; underwater communication; buoy
AB To monitor ocean and seafloor properties in detail, sensors are generally installed on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). An AUV cannot accurately determine its absolute position and needs to communicate with a sea-surface vehicle. However, sea-surface vehicles cannot perform high-speed observations with high efficiency due to their low mobility and high labor and equipment costs, e.g., vessel charter charges, operator restraint time on the sea surface during observations, etc. From this perspective, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have potential as the next-generation communication platform. In this study, we conducted a demonstration experiment to use UAV as a sea-surface base for underwater communication with an AUV. We investigated the capability of a UAV to land on the sea surface, drift like a buoy to receive underwater data, and finally lift off to return to its base. The experimental results suggest that UAVs provide suitable communication performance for research near the shore in terms of robust hovering control, stability against sway, and operation speed. To carry out more complicated work (such as transportation) of UAVs, further research in areas such as weight reduction is required.

AB The transportation industry contributes a significant amount of carbon emissions and pollutants to the environment globally. The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has a significant potential to not only reduce carbon emissions, but also to provide needed energy storage to contribute to the adoption of distributed renewable generation. This paper focuses on a design model and methodology for increasing EV adoption through automated swapping of battery packs at battery sharing stations (BShS) as a part of a battery sharing network (BShN), which would become integral to the smart grid. Current battery swapping methodologies are reviewed and a new practical approach is proposed considering both the technical and socio-economic impacts. The proposed BShS/BShN provides novel solutions to some of the most preeminent challenges that EV adoption faces today such as range anxiety, grid reliability, and cost. Challenges and advancements specific to this solution are also discussed.

AB The indoor environment has brought new challenges for micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in terms of their being able to execute tasks with high positioning accuracy. Conventional positioning methods based on GPS are unreliable, although certain circumstances of limited space make it possible to apply new technologies. In this paper, we propose a novel indoor self-positioning system of UAV based on a heterogeneous sensing system, which integrates data from a structured light scanner, ultra-wideband (UWB), and an inertial navigation system (INS). We made the structured light scanner, which is composed of a low-cost structured light and camera, ourselves to improve the positioning accuracy at a specified area. We applied adaptive Kalman filtering to fuse the data from the INS and UWB while the vehicle was moving, as well as Gauss filtering to fuse the data from the UWB and the structured light scanner in a hovering state. The results of our simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed strategy significantly improves positioning accuracy in motion and also in the hovering state, as compared to using a single sensor.

AB In this paper, we present the development of a quad-rotor tail-sitter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that is composed of quad rotors and a fixed wing. The developed UAV can hover like a quad-rotor helicopter and can fly long distance like a fixed-wing airplane. The main wing of the developed UAV is taken from a commercially available radio-controlled airplane and other parts such as the body frame are newly developed. A microcomputer, various sensors and a battery are mounted on the UAV for autonomous flight without any support from a ground system. Attitude and altitude control systems are developed for the UAV. In order to verify the designed controller, a three-dimensional flight simulator of a quad-rotor tail-sitter UAV is developed by use of MATLAB/Simulink. This paper also describes attitude control experiments. The results show that the propeller slipstream has a negative influence on attitude control. Solutions for the negative influence of the propeller slipstream are also discussed in this paper. (C) Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden and The Robotics Society of Japan, 2012

AB Unmanned vehicles are an effective platform for tracking, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. Existing control algorithms promote collaboration of unmanned aerial vehicles and other autonomous vehicles. However, these algorithms often fail to account for the degradation of control performance caused by flowfields. This paper presents decentralized multivehicle coordination algorithms designed for operation in a spatially or temporally varying flowfield. Each vehicle is represented using a Newtonian particle traveling at constant speed relative to the flow and subject to a steering control. An algorithm is described that stabilizes a circular formation in a time-varying spatially nonuniform flowfield, assuming that the flowfield is known and does not exceed the particle speed relative to the flow. For a time-varying and spatially uniform flowfield, an algorithm is provided to stabilize a circular formation in which the temporal spacing between particles is regulated. These algorithms are extended by relaxing the assumption that the flow is known: each particle dynamically estimates the flow and uses that estimate in the control. It is shown that including a turning-rate bound does not alter the main results. The theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations that illustrate the coordinated encirclement of a maneuvering target.

AB Simulation is often used as a technique to test and evaluate systems, as it provides a cost-efficient and safe alternative for testing and evaluation. A combination of simulators can be used to create high-fidelity and realistic test scenarios, especially when the systems-under-test are complex. An example of such complex systems is Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS), which include many actors that are connected to each other via wireless communication in order to interact and cooperate. The majority of the actors in the systems are vehicles equipped with wireless communication modules, which can range from fully autonomous vehicles to manually driven vehicles. In order to test and evaluate C-ITS, this paper presents a distributed simulation framework that consists of (a) a moving base driving simulator; (b) a real-time vehicle simulator; and (c) network and traffic simulators. We present our approach for connecting and co-simulating the simulators. We report on limitation and performance that this simulation framework can achieve. Lastly, we discuss potential benefits and feasibility of using the simulation framework for testing of C-ITS. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper focuses on the control of a cooperative system composed of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) manipulating an object. The two units are subject to input saturations and collaborate to move the object to a desired pose characterized by its position and inclination. The dynamics are derived using the Euler-Lagrange method. A stabilizing control law is proposed where the UGV is tasked to deploy the object to a certain position whereas the UAV adjusts its inclination. In particular, a proportional-derivative control law is proposed for the UGV, and a cascade control is used for the UAV, where the inner loop controls the attitude of the UAV and the outer loop stabilizes the inclination of the object. The stability of the points of equilibrium is proven using small gain arguments. To ensure constraints satisfaction at all times, a reference governor unit is added to this stabilizing control law. Simulations and experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the development of autonomous vehicles, the high reliability and low latency vehicular communication technologies have become more critical. The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) specifies the sidelink (SL) transmission based on New Radio (NR), aiming to meet stringent vehicle-to-everything (V2X) requirements. Compared with Long Term Evolution (LTE) V2X, which only supports broadcast use cases, NR V2X also supports unicast and groupcast. The groupcast operation allows the transmitter to communicate with multiple receivers in the same group at once. In general, the group size for vehicles is limited due to the high-reliability requirement. In this paper, we present reliable blind retransmission for NR V2X groupcast. We improve the groupcast transmission reliability by assigning the proper retransmission user equipment(UE). This paper proposes a retransmission UE assignment. We formulate a retransmission UE selection problem to maximize the group packet reception ratio (GPRR) for NR V2X distributed groupcast. The simulation results show that the proposed retransmission method improves the V2X groupcast in terms of GPRR, packet inter-reception time (PIR), and the available group size.

AB Typical Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers offer precision in the order of meters. This error margin is excessive for vehicular safety applications, such as forward collision warning, autonomous intersection management, or hard braking sensing. In this work we develop a Cooperative GNSS Positioning System (CooPS) that uses Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) communications to cooperatively determine absolute and relative position of the ego-vehicle with enough precision. To that end, we use differential GNSS through position vector differencing to acquire track and across-track axes projections, employing elliptical and spherical geometries. We evaluate CooPS performance by carrying out real experiments using off-the-shelf IEEE 802.11p equipment at the campus of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. We obtain an accuracy level under 1.0 and 1.5 m for track (where-in-lane) and across-track (which-lane) axes, respectively. These accuracy levels were achieved using a 2.5 m accuracy circular error probable (CEP) of 50% and a 5 Hz navigation update rate GNSS receiver. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In a recent work, the authors presented an extension of robust model reference adaptive control (MRAC) laws for spatially varying partial differential equations (PDEs) proposed by them earlier for the decentralized adaptive control of heterogeneous multiagent networks with agent parameter uncertainty using the partial difference equations (PdEs) on graphs framework. The examples provided demonstrated the capabilities of this approach under the assumption that individual vehicles executing coordinated maneuvers were fully actuated and characterized by linear dynamics. However, detailed models for autonomous vehicles - whether terrestrial, aerial, or aquatic - are often underactuated and strongly nonlinear. Using this approach, but assuming the plant parameters to be known, this work presents the model reference (MR) control laws without adaptation for the coordination of underactuated aquatic vehicles modeled individually in terms of strongly nonlinear dynamic equations arising from ideal planar hydrodynamics. The case of unknown plant parameters for this class of underactuated agents with complex dynamics is an open problem. The paper is based on an invited talk on adaptive control presented at the 2008 World Congress of Nonlinear Analysts. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article addresses the spherical formation tracking control problem of nonlinear second-order vehicles moving in flowfields under both undirected networks and directed, strongly connected networks. Different from the previous adaptive estimate of the time-invariant parameters of flowfields, the flowfields under our consideration are spatial and absolutely unknown dynamics. Adaptive neural networks (ANNs) with the novel cooperative adaptive algorithms are proposed to approximate the flowfield acting on the channel of each vehicle's velocity (i.e., the mismatched flowfield) and the flowfield pushing the acceleration (i.e., the matched flowfield), respectively. For the purpose of avoiding the complex derivation derived from backstepping, the novel first-order filters are generated by dynamic surface based on barrier functions and relative positions of neighbors. The proposed control algorithms and adaptive upgrade law are fully distributed without using any global information of the graph. The uniform boundedness is analyzed in the Lyapunov sense. Simulation results are given to verify the theoretical analysis.

AB Different manufacturing environments, such as aerospace, automotive, shipbuilding, and railway, reveal their interest in large scale metrology (LSM) instruments, to provide support in assembly, alignment, inspection, and robot tracking tasks. Notwithstanding different levels of portability, the overall measurement procedure actually involves a direct interaction between the measuring equipment and the operator, as well as a strong dependence on human skills. This paper presents a novel metrological system, scaling down this interaction to a mission management task and aimed at making system performance uniform. The proposed architecture entrusts an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with the task of carrying the sensor equipment and of moving the measuring probe. The design process of the proposed system is detailed and faced with a two-level approach. The first level is directed to identify the available start-up technology, its limitations and sensitivity to the design parameters, while the second level is focused on the experimental testing of a preliminary test-bed to investigate the overall system performance. An actual implementation of the proposed architecture is herein discussed, focusing on system feasibility and presenting some preliminary experimental results.

AB Objective: Connected and automated vehicles (CAV) can monitor multiple vehicles ahead via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. Although feedback information from more vehicles ahead may be more helpful for anticipations, it also makes control more complex and increases the probability of data packet loss. Then it needs an appropriate number of CAV feedback links, and the maximum number may be not suitable. Therefore, this article focuses on the influence of CAV feedback links on rear-end collision risks. Methods: To deal with this, stability analysis of a CAV car-following model was conducted to obtain the designs of CAV feedback gains for maintaining stable CAV flow. Simulation experiments were performed to describe a traffic accident on freeway, using car-following models of manually driven vehicles (MDVs) and CAV under different CAV penetration rates. Four scenarios are considered in simulation experiments; that is, the CAV monitors 1, 2, 3, and 4 preceding vehicles, respectively. Based on the simulation experiments, surrogate safety indicators, time-exposed time-to-collision (TET), and time-integrated time-to-collision (TIT) are used to evaluate risks of rear-end collisions. Results: Results indicated that CAV helped to decrease the collision risks, especially the more serious collision risks with smaller threshold values of time-to-collision (TTC). In addition, the reductions in collision risks are more obvious when CAV feedback changes from one link to 2 links. In addition, reducing amplitudes are not significant if the CAV feedback is extended from 2 links to 3 or 4 links. Conclusions: Two links of CAV feedback are appropriate when control complexity is a priority, whereas 3 links is the better choice when reductions in collisions are a priority. The findings of this study provide helpful reference for CAV control and design before larger-scale implementation in real vehicles.

AB The breakthrough of blockchain technology has facilitated the emergence and deployment of a wide range of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) networks-based applications. Yet, the full utilization of these applications is still limited due to the fact that each application is operating on an isolated blockchain. Thus, it is inevitable to orchestrate these blockchain fragments by introducing a cross-blockchain platform that governs the inter-communication and transfer of assets in the UAV networks context. In this paper, we survey the literature on the state-of-the-art cross blockchain frameworks to highlight the latest advances in the field. We also provide an up-to-date review of blockchain-based UAV networks applications. Based on the outcomes of our survey, we introduce a spectrum of scenarios related to UAV networks that may leverage the potentials of the currently available cross-blockchain solutions. Finally, we identify open issues and potential challenges associated with the application of a cross-blockchain scheme for UAV networks that will hopefully guide future research directions.

AB This paper addresses the problem of controlling a heterogeneous system composed of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) for formation and containment maintenance. The proposed approach considers actuator time delay and, in addition to formation and containment, considers obstacle avoidance, and offers a robust navigation algorithm and uses a reliable middleware for data transmission and exchange. The methodology followed uses both flocking technique and modified L1 adaptive control to ensure the proper navigation and coordination while avoiding obstacles. The data exchange between all the agents is provided through the data distribution services (DDS) middleware, which solves the interoperability issue when dealing with heterogeneous multiagent systems. The modified L1 controller is a local controller for stabilizing the dynamic model of each UAV and AUV, and the flocking approach is used to coordinate the followers around the leader or within the space delimited by their leaders. Potential Field (PF) allows obstacle avoidance during the agents' movement. The performance of the proposed approach under the considerations mentioned above are verified and demonstrated using simulations.

AB Prediction of surrounding vehicles accurately is an essential prerequisite for safe autonomous driving. Trajectory prediction methods can be classified into physics-, maneuver-, or learning-based methods. Learning-based methods have been studied extensively in recent years because it effectively exploits the road information and interactions among vehicles. However, learning-based methods perform poorly in unseen environments that were not considered during training and provide unreasonable results such as inconsistent trajectories according to road geometry. In this paper, to address this problem, a hybrid model that combines a learning-based model with physics- and maneuver-based models according to their uncertainties is proposed. The deep ensemble technique is also used to estimate the uncertainty of the learning-based method. Because the deep ensemble tends to show a large variance in unseen environments, this method is used to determine whether to use a hybrid model. The proposed method is trained and validated using the Lyft l5 dataset, the real environment vehicle driving data containing several types of intersections.

AB Future autonomous vehicles will generate, collect, aggregate and consume significant volumes of data as key gateway devices in emerging Internet of Things scenarios. While vehicles are widely accepted as one of the most challenging mobility contexts in which to achieve effective data communications, less attention has been paid to the privacy of data emerging from these vehicles. The quality and usability of such privatized data will lie at the heart of future safe and efficient transportation solutions.
   In this paper, we present the K Privacy mechanism. K Privacy is to our knowledge the first such mechanism that enables data creators to submit multiple contradictory responses to a query, whilst preserving utility measured as the absolute error from the actual original data. The functionalities are achieved in both a scalable and secure fashion. For instance, individual location data can be obfuscated while preserving utility, thereby enabling the scheme to transparently integrate with existing systems (e.g. Waze). A new cryptographic primitive Function Secret Sharing is used to achieve non-attributable writes and we show an order of magnitude improvement from the default implementation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB For their complete realization, autonomous vehicles (AVs) fundamentally rely on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) to provide positioning and navigation information. However, in area such as urban cores, parking lots, and under dense foliage, which are all commonly frequented by AVs, GNSS signals suffer from blockage, interference, and multipath. These effects cause high levels of errors and long durations of service discontinuity that mar the performance of current systems. The prevalence of vision and low-cost inertial sensors provides an attractive opportunity to further increase the positioning and navigation accuracy in such GNSS-challenged environments. This paper presents enhancements to existing multisensor integration systems utilizing the inertial navigation system (INS) to aid in Visual Odometry (VO) outlier feature rejection. A scheme called Aided Visual Odometry (AVO) is developed and integrated with a high performance mechanization architecture utilizing vehicle motion and orientation sensors. The resulting solution exhibits improved state covariance convergence and navigation accuracy, while reducing computational complexity. Experimental verification of the proposed solution is illustrated through three real road trajectories, over two different land vehicles, and using two low-cost inertial measurement units (IMUs).

AB This paper proposes a new control scheme for underwater vehicles. These systems are highly nonlinear and they often operate in a varying environment. A robust controller is therefore needed to deal with these challenges. The recently developed L-1 adaptive controller is proposed to be designed and implemented in real time for the first time on an underwater vehicle. Different experimental scenarios are then conducted to test the performance of the closed-loop system in two degrees of freedom. An interesting particularity of this controller lies in its architecture where robustness and adaptation are decoupled enabling thus high adaptation gains. This would result in a fast adaptation with a guaranteed smooth transient response without any persistency of excitation. In order to validate the choice of this controller, a comparative study is proposed to be conducted with the well proven adaptive nonlinear state feedback controller (ANSF). Real-time experimental results are proposed for different scenarios including nominal case, external disturbances rejection and robustness towards parameters uncertainties. This comparative study highlights clearly the superiority of the L-1 adaptive controller. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Automated vehicles (AVs) represent a socio-technical transition of the mobility system. Thus far, research has focused predominantly on the technical dimension (i.e. technology development and operation, short-term impacts) of this transition. This paper presents a research agenda that contributes in rebalancing the focus from the technical to the societal dimension of the AVs transition. We adopt the social construction of technology approach, suggesting that technology and society are involved in a dialectical process over time that constructs each other and we identify three key dynamics of the societal dimension of AVs transition based on the multilevel perspective of technological transition. After reviewing the scholarly literature, we suggest an expansion of the research focus in three key research areas: societal acceptance, societal implications and governance of AVs to account for the societal dimension of the AVs transition. In the first area, we suggest an expansion of the research focus from consumers' adoption to citizens' acceptance of introduction of AVs. In the second area, we suggest an expansion of the research focus from short-term to long-term societal implications of AVs. In the third area, we suggest a shift from exploratory scenarios to participative anticipatory governance of desirable AVs futures.

TI UAV flight coordination for communication networks: genetic algorithms

   Wireless communication
AB The autonomous coordinated flying for groups of unmanned aerial vehicles that maximise network coverage to mobile ground-based units by efficiently utilising the available on-board power is a complex problem. Their coordination involves the fulfilment of multiple objectives that are directly dependent on dynamic, unpredictable and uncontrollable phenomena. In this paper, two systems are presented and compared based on their ability to reposition fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles to maintain a useful airborne wireless network topology. Genetic algorithms and non-cooperative games are employed for the generation of optimal flying solutions. The two methods consider realistic kinematics for hydrocarbon-powered medium-altitude, long-endurance aircrafts. Coupled with a communication model that addresses environmental conditions, they optimise flying to maximising the number of supported ground-based units. Results of large-scale scenarios highlight the ability of genetic algorithms to evolve flexible sets of manoeuvres that keep the flying vehicles separated and provide optimal solutions over shorter settling times. In comparison, game theory is found to identify strategies of predefined manoeuvres that maximise coverage but require more time to converge.

AB This paper proposes a taxonomy of conflict detection and resolution (CD&R) approaches for operating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in an integrated airspace. Possible approaches for UAVs are surveyed and broken down based on their types of surveillance, coordination, maneuvering, and autonomy. The factors are combined back selectively, with regard to their feasibility for operation in an integrated airspace, into several "generic approaches" that form the CD&R taxonomy. These generic approaches are then attributed to a number of available methods in the literature to determine their position in the overall CD&R scheme. The attribution shows that many proposed methods are actually unsuitable for operation in an integrated airspace. Furthermore, some part of the taxonomy does not have an adequate representative in the literature, suggesting the need to concentrate UAV CD&R research more in those particular parts. Finally, a multilayered CD&R architecture is built from the taxonomy, implementing the concept of defense in depth to ensure safe operation of UAVs in an integrated civil airspace.

AB The ongoing development autonomous vehicles and adaptive vehicle dynamics present in many modern vehicles has generated a need for road environment classification-i.e., the ability to determine the nature of the current road or terrain environment from an onboard vehicle sensor. In this paper, we investigate the use of a low-cost camera vision solution capable of urban, rural, or off-road classification based on the analysis of color and texture features extracted from a driver's perspective camera view. A feature set based on color and texture distributions is extracted from multiple regions of interest in this forward-facing camera view and combined with a trained classifier approach to resolve two road-type classification problems of varying difficulty-{off-road, on-road} environment determination and the additional multiclass road environment problem of {off-road, urban, major/trunk road and multilane motorway/carriageway}. Two illustrative classification approaches are investigated, and the results are reported over a series of real environment data. An optimal performance of similar to 90% correct classification is achieved for the {off-road, on-road} problem at a near real-time classification rate of 1 Hz.

ID ROBOTS
AB The purpose of this paper is to describe the design and implementation of an unmanned ground vehicle, called the Bearcat III, named after the University of Cincinnati mascot. The Bearcat III is an electric powered, three-wheeled vehicle that was designed for the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition and has been tested in the contest for 5 years. The dynamic model, control system, and design of the sensory systems are described. For the autonomous challenge line following, obstacle detection and pothole avoidance are required. Line following is accomplished with a dual camera system and video tracker. Obstacle detection is accomplished with either a rotating ultrasound or laser scanner. Pothole detection is implemented with a video frame grabber. For the navigation challenge waypoint following and obstacle detection are required. The waypoint navigation is implemented with a global positioning system. The Bearcat III has provided an educational test bed for not only the contest requirements but also other studies in developing artificial intelligence algorithms such as adaptive learning, creative control, automatic calibration, and internet-based control. The significance of this effort is in helping engineering and technology students understand the transition from theory to practice. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This article provides a detailed analysis of the assessment of unmanned ground vehicle terrain traversability. The analysis is categorized into terrain classification, terrain mapping, and cost-based traversability, with subcategories of appearance-based, geometry-based, and mixed-based methods. The article also explores the use of machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL) and other based end-to-end methods as crucial components for advanced terrain traversability analysis. The investigation indicates that a mixed approach, incorporating both exteroceptive and proprioceptive sensors, is more effective, optimized, and reliable for traversability analysis. Additionally, the article discusses the vehicle platforms and sensor technologies used in traversability analysis, making it a valuable resource for researchers in the field. Overall, this paper contributes significantly to the current understanding of traversability analysis in unstructured environments and provides insights for future sensor-based research on advanced traversability analysis.(c) 2023 Karabuk University.

AB Over the past few decades, numerous adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) algorithms have been proposed to alleviate traffic congestion and optimize traffic mobility using real-time traffic data, such as data from connected vehicles (CVs). However, most of the existing ATSC algorithms do not consider optimizing traffic safety, likely because of the lack of tools to evaluate safety in real time. In this paper, we propose a novel ATSC algorithm for real-time safety optimization. The algorithm utilizes a traditional Reinforcement Learning approach (i.e., Q-learning) as well as recently developed extreme value theory (EVT) real-time crash prediction models. The algorithm was validated using real-world traffic video data collected from two signalized intersections in British Columbia. The results indicated that, compared with an existing fully actuated signal controller, the developed algorithm can significantly reduce the real-time crash risk by 43% to 45% at the intersection's approaches even at low CVs market penetration rates.

ID MODEL
AB In this paper, we discuss the deployment and testing of an intelligent real-time isolated intersection traffic control system (IICS), designed to optimize simultaneously signal control and automated vehicle (AV) and connected vehicle (CV) trajectories for low demand condition. The work described here is part of an ongoing larger project (funded by the National Science Foundation and the Florida Department of Transportation, FDOT) to develop, test, and deploy the IICS. The focus of this paper is on the deployment and testing of the algorithm at the Traffic Engineering and Research Laboratory (TERL), FDOT's closed-course facility. The algorithm (described in more detail elsewhere) optimizes signal control and provides optimal AV and CV trajectories at isolated intersections. The algorithm is designed to handle AV, CV, and conventional vehicles in a mixed traffic and low demand condition. The paper provides an overview of the IICS framework, discusses the development and testing of the necessary software and hardware, and presents the scenarios tested at the TERL. The results from the field test confirm the feasibility of the IICS, and will be used to enhance it for future testing and ultimately for field deployment and in high demand condition.

ID PLANNING-ALGORITHMS
AB With the rapidly growing interest in autonomous navigation, the body of research on motion planning and collision avoidance techniques has enjoyed an accelerating rate of novel proposals and developments. However, the complexity of new techniques and their safety requirements render the bulk of current bench marking frameworks inadequate, thus leaving the need for efficient comparison techniques unanswered. This work proposes a novel framework based on deep reinforcement learning for bench marking the behavior of collision avoidance mechanisms under the worst-case scenario of dealing with an optimal adversarial agent, trained to drive the system into unsafe states. We describe the architecture and flow of this framework as a benchmarking solution, and demonstrate its efficacy via a practical case study of comparing the reliability of two collision avoidance mechanisms in response to adversarial attempts to cause collisions.

AB Anti-personnel mines are blind terror weapons designed to maim. About 100 million mines have to be removed from the ground of 60 nations. Well trained dogs are efficient for localizing mines, but they tire quickly. Manual searching, by prodding the ground, is used in demining campaigns, at an average cost of $800 per neutralized mine. The purpose of this project is to design and build a light-weight semi-autonomous robot that would detect mines and mark their location for further action. The Pemex-B is a simple design with two driving wheels and a third supporting point where the mines are sensed. Navigation software has been tested on reduced-scale models.

AB Drivers are being confronted by the task of controlling vehicles together with automation systems before autonomous vehicles are even fully realized. A novel human-oriented online driving authority optimization shared steering framework is proposed to solve the problem of allocating driving authority between automation and human driver, in which the model predictive control(MPC) method is used to online optimize the driving authority. The merits of this framework is that, on the one hand, human driver workload can be alleviated in the case that the driver and the automation have similar driving intentions. On the other hand, the human driver has absolute control authority over an intelligent vehicle when the automation intention is inconsistent with that of the human driver. To illustrate the characteristics of the designed online driving authority optimization framework, simulations are carried out in the case of driver-automation cooperation and driver-automation non-cooperation. The results show that the proposed online driving authority optimization shared steering framework can not only restrict vehicles to safe areas but also lessen the driver's workload.

AB The six-wheel independent drive and four-wheel independent steering unmanned ground vehicle (6WID/4WIS UGV) with variable wheelbase has unique advantages in environmen-tal adaptability and maneuverability. However, due to its strong nonlinearity and uncer-tainty, it has the great challenges in control. Based on model free adaptive control (MFAC) method and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, the heading tracking problem of 6WID/4WIS UGV under the influence of uncertainties is studied in this paper. First, to improve the convergence characteristics, the improved MFAC scheme is proposed, which can effectively overcome the influence of time delay and wheelbase. Then, based on the desired steering angle and yaw moment obtained by MFAC method and the single-track model of 6WID/4WIS UGV, the torque of six electric wheels is distributed by PSO algorithm to achieve the coordinated control of driving, braking and steering. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy are verified by simulation results.

AB This paper discusses the longitudinal Right-path control law designed and Eight tested for the Automatic Landing Flight Experiment (ALFLEX). ALFLEX, for which Eight tests were conducted in 1996, demonstrated Japanese potential for developing automatic landing technology for a reentry space vehicle. One of the critical factors in satisfying the design requirements for landing on a limited length runway was longitudinal flight-path control following the preflare maneuver. Robustness against uncertainties and sensor errors is a key issue in longitudinal night-path control. The longitudinal guidance and control laws were carefully designed and flight tested. Although the flight tests proved that the design satisfied all landing requirements, it identified critical parameters affecting landing performance such as vehicle longitudinal aerodynamics, navigation error, and air data sensor error. This paper describes data obtained during the development and flight tests, as well as further investigations conducted after the flight tests in order to improve landing performance for future space vehicle developments. In the subsequent design review a new approach called stochastic gain tuning was adopted, where the guidance feedback gain is tuned to maximize the probability of mission success. The results indicate some possibility of improvement of robustness.

AB The applications of remote sensing technologies to precision agriculture were reviewed. The different uses of conventional satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for data collection were also examined. The ways in which the collected data have been used in terms of precision agriculture are laid out in further detail. Modern UAVs provide a range of advantages over conventional satellites in data collection and analysis. In addition, precision agriculture itself is a wide topic; and practitioners, researchers, and policy planners need to account for a complex value chain with diverse stakeholders. Thus, in order to further the discussion in a meaningful manner, the later sections of this article provide additional analysis on topics deemed crucial for the development of precision agriculture: a discussion on key technological limitations for scaling, a corresponding list of suggestions for the development of solutions, and a brief overview on the current social-economical landscape of the agriculture industry.

AB In this article, we address the difficulty of controlling unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) under unforeseeable and unobservable external disturbances using model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) without human's prior knowledge. A novel MBRL approach, filtered probabilistic model predictive control (FPMPC) is proposed to iteratively learn the USV model and an MPC-based policy in a probabilistic way through trial-and-error interactions. Compared with existing MBRL approaches that model the unobservable disturbances as system noise, FPMPC introduces a Bayesian filter process to implicitly translate the system dynamics to a partially-observed Markov decision process to present those disturbances as hidden states. An adaptive sample selection is proposed to remove the redundant learning samples based on the filter belief. Equipped with bias compensation and parallel computation, an FPMPC system, specific for USV, is developed. Evaluated by both position holding and target reaching tasks in a real USV data-driven simulation, FPMPC shows its significant superiority in control performances, generalization capability, and sample efficiency under large disturbances compared with the baseline approaches.

AB Blockchain technology's popularity in terms of security, privacy, traceability, and trust is being applied in various major applications concerning connected autonomous vehicles. One of the most sensitive applications is military operations. We do not compromise with either security, privacy, trust, or communication latency of connected military vehicles, i.e., Internet of military vehicles (IoMVs). Achieving anonymity along with the security and privacy of sender, receiver, and data path for IoMVS is still an open question. Efforts we have made to address the aforementioned issue by proposing a blockchain-based onion routing protocol for IoMVs, i.e., B-IoMV, to achieve secure, trusted, and anonymous D2D communication. We studied the working of onion routing and presented a blockchain and token-based solution to strengthen the security and anonymity of IoMVs. A blockchain-based solution is quite costly and we use InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to make the proposed B-IoMV system cost-effective. Finally, results show that the proposed B-IoMV system achieved better communication latency, data storage cost, and network bandwidth utilization. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; TRAJECTORIES
AB The future environmental impacts of battery electric vehicles (EVs) are very important given their expected dominance in future transport systems. Previous studies have shown these impacts to be highly uncertain, though a detailed treatment of this uncertainty is still lacking. We help to fill this gap by using Monte Carlo and global sensitivity analysis to quantify parametric uncertainty and also consider two additional factors that have not yet been addressed in the field. First, we include changes to driving patterns due to the introduction of autonomous and connected vehicles. Second, we deeply integrate scenario results from the IMAGE integrated assessment model into our life cycle database to include the impacts of changes to the electricity sector on the environmental burdens of producing and recharging future EVs. Future EVs are expected to have 45-78% lower climate change impacts than current EVs. Electricity used for charging is the largest source of variability in results, though vehicle size, lifetime, driving patterns, and battery size also strongly contribute to variability. We also show that it is imperative to consider changes to the electricity sector when calculating upstream impacts of EVs, as without this, results could be overestimated by up to 75%.

AB Haze removal is a non-trivial work for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aerial video processing, and challenges are mainly attributed to spatial-temporal coherence and computational efficiency. The authors propose a novel dehazing algorithm for hazy UAV aerial video and improve the classical dark channel prior approach with a bright region filling process to alleviate colour distortion in the recovered video, which enhances the spatial consistency. To achieve better temporal coherence, the authors constrain the atmospheric light estimation between adjacent frames by using a temporal filter. The authors also optimise the transmission calculation to reduce computational complexity. Experimental findings show that the proposed algorithm yields results superior to those obtained from previous methods. Compared with that in frame-by-frame dehazing, the processing time in the proposed method is reduced by 74.5%.

AB Autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) require a reliable navigation system that works in all environments. However, indoor navigation remains a challenge because the existing satellite-based navigation systems such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) are mostly unavailable indoors. In this paper, a tightly-coupled integrated navigation system that integrates two dimensional (2D) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), Inertial Navigation System (INS), and odometry is introduced. An efficient LiDAR-based line features detection/tracking algorithm is proposed to estimate the relative changes in orientation and displacement of the vehicle. Furthermore, an error model of INS/odometry system is derived. LiDAR-estimated orientation/position changes are fused by an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) with those predicted by INS/odometry using the developed error model. Errors estimated by EKF are used to correct the position and orientation of the vehicle and to compensate for sensor errors. The proposed system is verified through simulation and real experiment on an UGV equipped with LiDAR, MEMS-based IMU, and encoder. Both simulation and experimental results showed that sensor errors are accurately estimated and the drifts of INS are significantly reduced leading to navigation performance of sub-metre accuracy.

AB We report a decentralized extended information filter (DEIF) algorithm designed for single-beacon cooperative acoustic navigation of one or more client underwater vehicles. In single-beacon cooperative acoustic navigation, ranges and state information from a single reference source (the server) are used to improve localization and navigation of an underwater vehicle (the client). The ranges and state information are obtained using underwater acoustic modems and a synchronous-clock time-of-flight paradigm. Apart from the server's acoustic data broadcasts, the client has no access to the server's position or sensor measurements. We show that at the instance of each range measurement update, the DEIF algorithm yields identical results for the current vehicle state estimate as the corresponding centralized extended information filter (CEIF), which fully tracks the joint probability distribution between the server and client. We compare the state estimation results of the DEIF algorithm with that of a CEIF and three other filters reported in the literature. The evaluation is performed using both simulated data and an experimental dataset comprised of one surface craft and two autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB We are on the cusp of a new era of connected autonomous vehicles with unprecedented user experiences, tremendously improved road safety and air quality, highly diverse transportation environments and use cases, and a plethora of advanced applications. Realizing this grand vision requires a significantly enhanced vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication network that should be extremely intelligent and capable of concurrently supporting hyperfast, ultrareliable, and low-latency massive information exchange. It is anticipated that the sixth-generation (6G) communication systems will fulfill these requirements of the next-generation V2X. In this article, we outline a series of key enabling technologies from a range of domains, such as new materials, algorithms, and system architectures. Aiming for truly intelligent transportation systems, we envision that machine learning (ML) will play an instrumental role in advanced vehicular communication and networking. To this end, we provide an overview of the recent advances of ML in 6G vehicular networks. To stimulate future research in this area, we discuss the strength, open challenges, maturity, and enhancing areas of these technologies.

AB The road friction coefficient and the forces between the tire and the road have a significant impact on the stability and precise control of the vehicle. For four-wheel independent drive electric vehicles, an adaptive tire force calculation method based on the improved Levenberg-Marquarelt multi-module and self-organizing feedforward neural networks (LM-MMSOFNN) was proposed to estimate the three-directional tire forces of four wheels. The input data was provided by common sensors amounted on the autonomous vehicle, including the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and the wheel speed/rotation angle sensors (WSS, WAS). The road type was recognized through the road friction coefficient based on the vehicle dynamics model and Dugoff tire model, and then the tire force was calculated by the neural network. The computational complexity and storage space of the system were also reduced by the improved LM learning algorithm and self-organizing neurons. The estimation accuracy was further improved by using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Moving Average (MA). The performance of the proposed LM-MMSOFNN was verified through simulations and experiments. The results confirmed that the proposed method was capable of extracting important information from the sensors to estimate three-directional tire forces and accurately adapt to different road surfaces.

AB With the gradual popularization of self-driving, it is becoming increasingly important for vehicles to smartly make the right driving decisions and autonomously obey traffic rules by correctly recognizing traffic signs. However, for machine learning-based traffic sign recognition on the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), a large amount of traffic sign data from distributed vehicles is needed to be gathered in a centralized server for model training, which brings serious privacy leakage risk because of traffic sign data containing lots of location privacy information. To address this issue, we first exploit privacy-preserving federated learning to perform collaborative training for accurate recognition models without sharing raw traffic sign data. Nevertheless, due to the limited computing and energy resources of most devices, it is hard for vehicles to continuously undertake complex artificial intelligence tasks. Therefore, we introduce powerful Spike Neural Networks (SNNs) into traffic sign recognition for energy-efficient and fast model training, which is the next generation of neural networks and is practical and well-fitted to IoV scenarios. Furthermore, we design a novel encoding scheme for SNNs based on neuron receptive fields to extract information from the pixel and spatial dimensions of traffic signs to achieve high-accuracy training. Numerical results indicate that the proposed federated SNN outperforms traditional federated convolutional neural networks in terms of accuracy, noise immunity, and energy efficiency as well.

AB Two-unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) cooperative target locating based on airborne visual tracking platform is a common UAV reconnaissance mode. In the process of two-UAV cooperative target locating, the performance of target locating is highly dependent on UAV trajectory. In this Letter, a trajectory planning method for two-UAV cooperative target locating is presented. Using the line-of-sight (LOS) targeting property of the airborne visual tracking platform, in combination with the azimuth angle and elevation angle of the measured LOS, a locating error model is established, which can reflect the correlation between the target locating error and LOS angle error. Then an objective function based on minimising the target locating error is built, which is used as an index of two-UAV trajectory planning. This method can be applied in two-UAV trajectory planning for cooperative target locating and the simulated results confirm that it works effectively.

AB This research conducted a comprehensive study to better estimate the impact of production Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) on uninterrupted flow facilities using the highly cited ACC car-following models in the literature. Four different car-following models were investigated, including the Autonomous Adaptive Cruise Control (AACC) model, Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), California Partners for Advanced Transit and Highways (PATH) empirical ACC model, and the Technical University of Delft empirical ACC model. Each of the four models were recalibrated using data collected by a 2013 Cadillac SRX with production ACC engaged while following a human-driven 2013 Cadillac SRX in northern Virginia. Off-the-shelf commercial microscopic simulation software VISSIM was utilized to simulate the ACC traffic flow. Sensitivity analysis was conducted on ACC market penetration and following headway. Capacity and fundamental diagrams were used to quantify the impact of the ACC on traffic flow. Results indicate that freeway capacity highly depends on the market penetration of ACC vehicles. Small number of ACC vehicles (<25%) is beneficial to roadway capacity, while wider deployment of ACC vehicles (>75%) significantly harms capacity. The results strongly suggest the urgent need for vehicle connectivity.

AB This article presents a survey of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and data fusion techniques for object detection and environmental scene perception in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We critically evaluate some current SLAM implementations in robotics and autonomous vehicles and their applicability and scalability to UAVs. SLAM is envisioned as a potential technique for object detection and scene perception to enable UAV navigation through continuous state estimation. In this article, we bridge the gap between SLAM and data fusion in UAVs while also comprehensively surveying related object detection techniques such as visual odometry and aerial photogrammetry. We begin with an introduction to applications where UAV localization is necessary, followed by an analysis of multimodal sensor data fusion to fuse the information gathered from different sensors mounted on UAVs. We then discuss SLAM techniques such as Kalman filters and extended Kalman filters to address scene perception, mapping, and localization in UAVs. The findings are summarized to correlate prevalent and futuristic SLAM and data fusion for UAV navigation, and some avenues for further research are discussed.

AB The Global Positioning System (GPS) has been widely used in land vehicle navigation applications. However, the positioning systems based on GPS alone face great problems in the so-called urban canyon environments, where the GPS signals are often blocked by highrise buildings and there are not enough available satellite signals to estimate the positioning information of a fix. To solve the problem, a constrained method is presented by approximately modeling the path of the vehicle in the urban canyon environments as pieces of lines. By adding this constraint, the minimum number of available satellites reduces to two, which is satisfied in many urban canyon environments. Then, different approaches using the constrained method are systematically developed. In addition, a state-augmentation method is proposed to simultaneously estimate the positions of the GPS receiver and the parameters of the line. Furthermore, the interacting multiple model method is used to determine the correct path which the vehicle follows after passing an intersection of roads. Simulation results show that this approach can solve the urban canyon problems successfully.

AB A state feedback navigation control system based on a virtual Ackerman steering model is proposed in this study to address the problems of the poor smoothness of steering control and low control accuracy of tracked vehicles. The proposed system uses a real-time dynamic positioning global navigation satellite system. Furthermore, it incorporates cubic spline interpolation to smoothen a predetermined path. In addition, a path-tracking control method based on pole assignment, virtual Ackerman steering control model of a single-cylinder diesel-enginepowered tracked vehicle, and forward-steering proportional control method based on the principle of pulsewidth modulation were designed. Simulations and field experiments were performed to test the application of the proposed system. The experimental results indicated that the absolute average and standard deviation of the path waypoint interval decreased from 0.227 and 0.348 m to 0.018 and 0.015 m, respectively. In 5- and 6-mradius-circular and straight-line path-tracking simulations, the average error in path tracking was less than 0.002 m. For path tracking in an orchard environment, the average tracking error and standard error deviation between tree rows were 0.051 and 0.084 m, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed control system enable significantly stable control of single-cylinder diesel-engine-powered tracked vehicles, and its control accuracy meets the operational objectives of tracked vehicles.

AB Flocking control has been studied extensively along with the wide applications of multivehicle systems. In this article, the distributed flocking control strategy is studied for a network of autonomous vehicles with limited communication range. The main difference from the existing methods lies in that collision avoidance is considered a necessary condition while the vehicles are driven to follow a common desired trajectory under the proximity network. The sufficient conditions for system feasibility and stability are given by the proposed strategy. First, a centralized standard model predictive control (MPC) scheme is adopted to formulate the multivehicle flocking control problem by setting collision avoidance as an optimization constraint under the proximity network. Further, an equivalent distributed MPC (DMPC) is developed based on the consensus of local controllers under the existing framework of the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM). However, it may require infinite time to achieve consensus for all vehicles and, thus, the local controllers resulting in a limited number of ADMM iterations may not satisfy the given constraints. The constraints for each local controller are then modified so that the collision between vehicles is avoided all of the time. The feasibility and stability of the proposed method are analyzed under practical conditions. Simulation and experimental results show that the flocking of vehicles can track the common desired trajectory stably with no collisions by the proposed method.

AB Trajectory prediction of surrounding objects plays a pivotal role in the field of autonomous driving vehicles. In the current rollout process, it suffers from an accumulation of errors, which has a negative impact on prediction accuracy. This paper proposes a parametric-learning recursive least-squares (RLS) method integrated with an encoder-decoder framework for trajectory prediction, named the recursive least-squares-based refinement network (RRN). Through the generation of several anchors in the future trajectory, RRN can capture both local and global motion patterns. We conducted experiments on the prevalent NGSIM and INTERACTION datasets, which contain various scenarios such as highways, intersections and roundabouts. The promising results indicate that RRN could improve the performance of the rollout trajectory prediction effectively.

AB Estimating the configuration of a vehicle is crucial for its navigation. Most approaches are based on (extended) Kalman filtering or particle filtering. An attractive alternative is considered here, which relies on interval analysis. Contrary to classical extended Kalman filtering it allows global localization, and contrary to particle filtering it provides guaranteed results in the sense that a set is computed that contains all of the configurations that are consistent with the data and hypotheses. This paper presents a real-time implementation of the process including a description of the platform and its modeling, the integration of the errors on the model and the localization method itself.

AB This paper investigates the application of deep reinforcement learning (RL) in the motion control for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), and proposes a novel general motion control framework which separates training and deployment. Firstly, the state space, action space, and reward function are customized under the condition of ensuring generality for various motion control tasks. Next, in order to efficiently learn the optimal motion control policy in the case that the AUV model is imprecise and there are unknown external disturbances, a virtual AUV model composed of the known and determined items of an actual AUV is put forward and a simulation training method is developed on this basis. Then, in the given deployment method, three independent extended state observers (ESOs) are designed to deal with the unknown items in different directions, and the final controller is obtained by compensating the estimated value of ESOs into the output of the optimal motion control policy obtained through simulation training. Finally, soft actor-critic is chosen as deep RL algorithm of the framework, and the generality and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified in four different AUV motion control tasks.(c) 2023 The Franklin Institute.

AB Accurate localization and mapping in a large-scale environment is an essential system of an autonomous vehicle. The difficulty of the previous LiDAR or LiDAR-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) methods is correcting long-term drift error in a large-scale environment. This paper proposes a novel approach of a large-scale, graph-based SLAM with traffic sign data involved in a high-definition (HD) map. The graph of the system is structured with the inertial measurement unit (IMU) factor, LiDAR-inertial odometry factor, map-matching factor, and loop closure factor. The local sliding window-based optimization method is employed for real-time processing. As a result, the proposed method improves the accuracy of the localization and mapping compared with the state-of-the-art LiDAR or LiDAR-inertial SLAM methods. In addition, the proposed method can localize accurately without revisit, required for conventional graph-based SLAM for graph optimization, unlike previous studies. The proposed method is intensively validated with a data set collected in a city where the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal is unreliable and on a university campus.

AB The AUV must be capable of fault diagnosis if it is to perform tasks in complex environments without human assistance. However, the current fault diagnosis methods for AUV lack of manual experience and accuracy, leading to the lack of fault handling capacity. Different from the traditional model-based fault diagnosis, we propose a new model-free fault diagnosis method characterized by a deep learning-based algorithm, which is a new Sequence Convolutional Neural Network (SeqCNN) that learns the patterns between state data and fault type. More specifically, the proposed SeqCNN aims to extract global feature and local feature from state data and classify the extracted information into different fault types, and can convert two-stage diagnosis mode into a single-stage one. Compared to the traditional model-based diagnosis, it can significantly reduce the time-consuming burden, simplify the diagnosis procedure and improve the efficiency. The effectiveness of SeqCNN was validated by a practical experiment on a small quadrotor AUV 'Haizhe'. The results indicate that the proposed SeqCNN can solve the problem of fault detection and fault isolation in single-stage diagnosis mode and that its accuracy is far superior to that of other deep learning diagnosis algorithms.

AB Signal interference between light detection and ranging (lidar) sensors has the potential to degrade range data integrity, which may challenge multilidar applications such as autonomous vehicles if not adequately considered. Our work proposes a methodology for evaluating lidar interference, analyzes distinct lidar interference phenomena, and validates a previously proposed model of interference between two circularly scanning, pulsed lidar sensors. The comparison between Monte Carlo simulated and experimentally observed interference events suggests that lidar interference may be inferred through geometrical approximations of lidar scanner arrangements. The experimental data quantify the occurrences of at least two modes of lidar interference-direct and scattered interference. When present, direct interference was found to occur one to two orders of magnitude greater in total occurrence than scattered interference. However, direct interference's effects represented an average range error of <1 m. Alternatively, scattered interference was observed with an average range error two to four orders of magnitude greater than direct interference and proportional to the maximum range of the victim lidar. Further characterizations of interference phenomenon are presented that include the angular distribution of erroneous ranging data, range distributions of errors, loss of in-tolerance points, and potential radiometric influences.

AB This paper presents methodologies and technologies for ultrasonic localization and pose tracking of an autonomous mobile robot (AMR) by using a fuzzy adaptive extended information filtering (FAEIF) scheme. A novel ultrasonic localization system, which consists of two ultrasonic transmitters and three receivers, is proposed to estimate both the static and the dynamic position and orientation of the AMR. FAEIF is presented to improve estimation accuracy and robustness for the proposed localization system, while the system lacks sufficient information of complete models or the process and measurement noise varies with time. Static pose estimation that utilizes the averaging approach is also investigated. Six time-of-flight ultrasonic measurements, together with the vehicle's dead-reckoned localization information, are merged to update the vehicle's pose by utilizing the FAEIF sensor fusion algorithm. The proposed algorithms were implemented using an industrial personal computer with a computation speed of 800 MHz and standard C++ programming techniques. The system prototype, together with computer simulations and experimental results, was used to confirm that the system not only provides precise estimation of both the static and dynamic pose of the AMR but also provides a simple economical structure for navigational use and installation/calibration.

AB A spectacular measurement campaign was carried out on a real-world motorway stretch of Hungary with the participation of international industrial and academic partners. The measurement resulted in vehicle based and infrastructure based sensor data that will be extremely useful for future automotive R&D activities due to the available ground truth for static and dynamic content. The aim of the measurement campaign was twofold. On the one hand, road geometry was mapped with high precision in order to build Ultra High Definition (UHD) map of the test road. On the other hand, the vehicles-equipped with differential Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) for ground truth localization-carried out special test scenarios while collecting detailed data using different sensors. All of the test runs were recorded by both vehicles and infrastructure. The paper also showcases application examples to demonstrate the viability of the collected data having access to the ground truth labeling. This data set may support a large variety of solutions, for the test and validation of different kinds of approaches and techniques. As a complementary task, the available 5G network was monitored and tested under different radio conditions to investigate the latency results for different measurement scenarios. A part of the measured data has been shared openly, such that interested automotive and academic parties may use it for their own purposes.

AB In this paper, we present a learning method to solve the vehicle overtaking problem, which demands a multitude of abilities from the agent to tackle multiple criteria. To handle this problem, we propose to adopt a multiple-goal reinforcement learning (MGRL) framework as the basis of our solution. By considering seven different goals, either Q-learning (QL) or double-action QL is employed to determine action decisions based on whether the other vehicles interact with the agent for that particular goal. Furthermore, a fusion function is proposed according to the importance of each goal before arriving to an overall but consistent action decision. This offers a powerful approach for dealing with demanding situations such as overtaking, particularly when a number of other vehicles are within the proximity of the agent and are traveling at different and varying speeds. A large number of overtaking cases have been simulated to demonstrate its effectiveness. From the results, it can be concluded that the proposed method is capable of the following: 1) making correct action decisions for overtaking; 2) avoiding collisions with other vehicles; 3) reaching the target at reasonable time; 4) keeping almost steady speed; and 5) maintaining almost steady heading angle. In addition, it should also be noted that the proposed method performs lane keeping well when not overtaking and lane changing effectively when overtaking is in progress.

AB This paper considers a task planning problem, which dispatches multiple unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to visit a set of targets located in ocean environments. The problem is modeled as a bi-level optimization to reduce the total and the individual navigation costs simultaneously. The upper-level allocates targets and schedules target visitation sequences, while the lower-level plans safe and economical paths between two targets under the current influence. Subsequently, a novel nested strategy is proposed to solve the bi-level problem, which modifies each level initialization process and can adaptively give the lower-level function evaluation number according to the problem complexity. Besides, the proposed strategy can adopt general metaheuristics as optimizers. Thus, two upperlevel and five lower-level algorithms are employed in combination, which covers most kinds of metaheuristics. Finally, the ten combinations of algorithms are tested on three large-scale and complex cases, and the results verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and strategy. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI Convex Approach to Three-Dimensional Launch Vehicle Ascent Trajectory

ID GUIDANCE; DESIGN
AB This paper deals with the optimization of the ascent trajectory of a multistage launch vehicle, from liftoff to the payload injection into the target orbit, considering inverse-square gravity acceleration and aerodynamic forces. A combination of lossless and successive convexification techniques is adopted to generate a sequence of convex problems that rapidly converges to the original problem solution. An automatic initialization strategy is proposed to make the solution process completely autonomous. In particular, a novel three-step continuation procedure is developed and proved to be more efficient than simpler strategies. This approach relies on the solution of intermediate problems, which either neglect atmospheric drag or fix the time-lengths of the launch vehicle ascent phases, that are solved in succession, gradually passing from easier instances of the optimization problem to the originally intended problem. State-of-the-art techniques to deal with such a complex problem are adopted to enhance the convergence rate, including safeguarding modifications, such as virtual controls and an adaptive trust region. To assess the validity of the proposed approach in a practical scenario, numerical results are presented for two representative practical applications, using as reference a Falcon 9 launch vehicle.

AB The current paper presents an upgrade of a pre-installed hydraulic system for the operation of a pallet handling robot for a freight delivery vehicle known as FURBOT (freight urban robotic vehicle). The automated forklift installed on FURBOT for loading/unloading of cargo is powered with the help of hydraulics. The previous hydraulic system worked via a classical approach with a fixed displacement pump and a bypass valve, making it work on full power when in use. An alternative design was proposed, simulated and installed on FURBOT; it uses a fixed displacement pump and changes the rotation speed in real time using a pressure sensor. Novelty was attained with the use of gear pumps for said scenario. A control algorithm is implemented in the processing unit for controlling the speed of the motor driving the pump. The main advantage of this approach is better use of energy for the vehicle's battery. The aim of this research is to control both the speed and maximum force exerted by the actuators with the help of a single sensor and an inexpensive pump.

AB Multi-agent systems allow the simulation of complex phenomena that cannot be easily described analytically. As an efficient tool, the agen t-oriented traffic models have emerged to investigate vehicular traffic behaviors. In this article, a new agent-based traffic simulation model is proposed for solving the traffic simulation problems. A vehicle with the driver is represented as a composite autonomous agent in this model. Different from the classical car-following principles, vehicle-agent moving approaches are proposed instead of particle-hopping techniques. This model defines reasonable acceleration and deceleration rates at any certain condition. In this simulation, this can offer a natural, even cognitive way to follow the leader and switch lane. The simulation results have verified that this model has achieved more realistic results without loss of accuracy than those obtained from the cellular automata traffic models. This model can provide better simulation performance than the traditional vehicle-following models which are used to investigate the nonequilibrium traffic flow. A comparison of the real flow with the simulated freeway flow and lane capacity highlights the validness of this model.

AB ETRI's Co-Pilot project is aimed at the development of an automated vehicle that cooperates with a driver and interacts with other vehicles on the road while obeying traffic rules without collisions. This paper presents a core block within the Co-Pilot system; the block is named "Co-Pilot agent" and consists of several main modules, such as road map generation, decision-making, and trajectory generation. The road map generation builds road map data to provide enhanced and detailed map data. The decision-making, designed to serve situation assessment and behavior planning, evaluates a collision risk of traffic situations and determines maneuvers to follow a global path as well as to avoid collisions. The trajectory generation generates a trajectory to achieve the given maneuver by the decision-making module. The system is implemented in an open-source robot operating system to provide a reusable, hardware-independent software platform; it is then tested on a closed road with other vehicles in several scenarios similar to real road environments to verify that it works properly for cooperative driving with a driver and automated driving.

AB Many autonomous vehicles and advanced driver-assistance systems are equipped with front-facing cameras that detect and track objects using deep-learning-based algorithms. However, the localization capability of monocular cameras is often overlooked. In this paper, a novel method for estimating the pixel-wise error in a detected object's location versus its ground truth is proposed. As the object moves away from the camera, the pixel errors are shown to be normally distributed with unique spreads along the image's vertical axis (y-pixel). The pixel error appears to be smaller as objects get farther away, while at the same distance range, objects have similar error distribution across the camera's horizontal view. The horizontal axis (x-pixel) error appears to be smaller while the distance moves further away. However, the x-pixel location along a constant y-pixel row has no impact on the error distribution. The estimated x and y-pixel error distributions can in turn be used to form a spatial error distribution for finding the location of a detected object within a certain confidence interval. The spatial errors are then projected onto the world coordinate system using a camera transformation matrix to give a more realistic sense of what this error means. The results show that location estimation using monocular cameras generates an elliptical error distribution around the object with a larger error in the y-pixel direction compared to the x-pixel direction. This error distribution can be important to fuse information from multiple range-detecting sensors as well as multi-vehicle and multi-object tracking. The uncertainty characterization for position measurement, as demonstrated in this paper is an essential element of tracking and, is sensor and algorithm dependent.

AB This paper presents a control architecture for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) named the Component Oriented Layer-based Architecture for Autonomy (COLA2). The proposal implements a component-oriented layer-based control architecture structured in three layers: the reactive layer, the execution layer, and the mission layer. Concerning the reactive layer, to improve the vehicle primitives' adaptability to unknown changing environments, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have been programmed. Starting from a learned-in-simulation policy, the RL-based primitive cableTracking has been trained to follow an underwater cable in a real experiment inside a water tank using the Ictineu AUV. The execution layer implements a discrete event system (DES) based on Petri nets (PNs). PNs have been used to safely model the primitives' execution flow by means of Petri net building block (PNBBs) that have been designed according to some reachability properties showing that it is possible to compose them preserving these qualities. The mission layer describes the mission phases using a high-level mission control language (MCL), which is automatically compiled into a PN. The MCL presents agreeable properties of simplicity and structured programming. MCL can be used to describe offline imperative missions or to describe planning operators, in charge of solving a particular phase of a mission. If planning operators are defined, an onboard planner will be able to sequence them to achieve the proposed goals. The whole architecture has been validated in a cable tracking mission divided in two main phases. First, the cableTracking primitive of the reactive layer has been trained to follow a cable in a water tank with the Ictineu AUV, one of the research platforms available in the Computer Vision and Robotics Group (VICOROB), University of Girona, Girona, Spain. Second, the whole architecture has been proved in a realistic simulation of a whole cable tracking mission.

AB Along with the development of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and wireless technology, the usage of applications that require low latency, such as autonomous driving and intelligent navigation, is increasing rapidly, and the demand for content is increasing greatly. This paper proposes an edge caching approach for the IoV based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (ECSMADRL) so as to resolve the problem of excessive response delay due to the large increase of data traffic in the IoV. The approach jointly considers content distribution and caching in dynamic environments. In other words, each moving vehicle in the IoV can be seen as an agent, and it can make decisions about content caching and content access adaptively according to the changing environment to minimize the delay in the process of content distribution. It is proved by experiments that compared with other methods, the proposed edge caching (EC) approach has better performance in reducing content distribution delay, improving content hit rate and success rate.

AB Nowadays, the power consumption and dependable repeated data collection are causing the main issue for fault or collision in controller area network (CAN), which has a great impact for designing autonomous vehicle in smart cities. Whenever a smart vehicle is designed with several sensor nodes, Internet of Things (IoT) modules are linked through CAN for reliable transmission of a message for avoiding collision, but it is failed in communication due to delay and collision in communication of message frame from a source node to the destination. Generally, the emerging role of IoT and vehicles has undoubtedly brought a new path for tomorrow's cities. The method proposed in this paper is used to gain fault-tolerant capability through Probabilistic Automatic Repeat Request (PARQ) and also Probabilistic Automatic Repeat Request (PARQ) with Fault Impact (PARQ-FI), in addition to providing optimal power allocation in CAN sensor nodes for enhancing the performance of the process and also significantly acting a role for making future smart cities.

AB This paper addresses the problem of trajectory tracking control for underactuated unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) with model parameter perturbation and constant unknown current in the horizontal plane. The globally finite-time tracking control strategy is adopted driving an UUV to track a predefined trajectory. Firstly, the horizontal trajectory tracking guidance laws are established by the virtual vehicle method, where the tracking error equations are derived. Secondly, the kinematic controllers are designed with equivalent control of the proportional-integral-derivative sliding mode control (PID-SMC). Thirdly, two dynamic controllers, including a speed controller and a steering controller, are designed by resorting to a first-order sliding mode surface and a second-order one, respectively. It is well proved that the proposed strategy can guarantee global convergence of all tracking errors within finite time. Simulations show that the control laws can achieve strongly robust and preferably control performance for the horizontal trajectory tracking control in the presence of the mode parameter perturbation and constant unknown current.

AB The development of autonomous navigation systems for agricultural vehicles is an important endeavor. We propose a position estimation method based on artificial landmarks and omnidirectional vision for agricultural vehicle navigation to augment GPS-based solutions. The method sets four red artificial landmarks as a rectangle in the corners of an operating area and estimates an absolute position relative to the landmark-based coordinate system on the ground. This article introduces an algorithm to extract the landmarks and estimate the directional angles of the landmarks using only one omnidirectional image. Camera location was estimated based on the directional angles of the landmarks. Experiments were conducted under natural sunlight in a 50 m X 50 m square area to verify the method. Experimental results showed that the maximum and mean position errors were about 46.96 cm and 31.99 cm, respectively. Camera tilt experiments showed that the tilt angle had some effect on errors, but not significantly, and it was not necessary to compensate for the errors caused by camera tilt on uneven ground. In conclusion, this method is feasible to augment GPS-based solutions for agricultural vehicle navigation.

DE The Internet of Vehicles; data sharing; blockchain; swarm learning
AB To provide various intelligent services in Internet of Vehicles (IoVs), such as autonomous driving, data sharing technologies enable vehicles to overcome information barriers and provide a big data foundation. Federated Learning (FL), which shares models instead of raw data, has emerged as a popular solution to address privacy concerns. However, current approaches have limited scalability and security, which are not suitable for the dynamic network topology of IoV scenarios. In this letter, we propose a Multi-Region Asynchronous Swarm Learning (MASL) framework in IoVs, which is empowered by the hierarchical blockchain and executed parallel between multiple regions. The MASL integrates identity verification and asynchronous model training while ensuring secure aggregation as well as data privacy. Through intra-regional and cross-regional sharing, the security and efficiency during large-scale data sharing in IoVs are effectively improved while alleviating the not Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) data problem. Finally, both the simulation and hardware testbed results demonstrate that the proposed MASL framework could achieve better performances in terms of efficiency and security compared with the existing algorithms.

AB Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have obtained increasing interests in recent decades. Because of the features of improved mission efficiency and decreased resource costs, applications of USVs can been seen in both civilian and naval areas. In order to efficiently and effectively achieve missions without any human intervention, a robust and intelligent navigation, guidance and control (NGC) system is vital for USV. This paper has therefore presented a novel NGC system designed for a USV named Springer. The system is developed by integrating multiple functional modules, which include a reliable navigation module that provides reliable position and heading information, a robust autopilot module enabling Springer tracking well the waypoints and an intelligent path planning module that is capable of generating feasible and practical waypoints. The path planning algorithm has been developed based upon the angle guidance fast marching square method, which is able to calculate the optimal path according to vehicle's motion constraints. The designed NGC system has been validated in both real field trials and computer based simulations proving that Springer USV is able to autonomously navigate in different maritime environments with the guidance of the NGC system.

AB The development of autonomous driving technology and communication technology has made it possible for the realization of vehicle platoon. In the future, for a long time, there will be a mixture of platoons and normal vehicles on the road. The platoon will have a greater impact on traffic flow. Therefore, it is necessary to study the characteristics of the traffic mixed by platoons and normal vehicles. In this paper, we propose a traffic flow model for the traffic mixed by platoons and normal vehicles based on cellular automata and analyze the influence of platoon market penetration and platoon size on the road capacity, traffic congestion, and lane change frequency. The paper draws the following main conclusions. Under a given traffic environment, there is an optimal platoon penetration and platoon size that can maximize the capacity. Platoons can effectively alleviate traffic congestion, while the congestion ratio approaches zero when the proportion and size of the platoon reach a certain threshold. When the platoon market penetration is below 40%, the lane change frequency of the platoon gradually increases with the increment of the platoon penetration and size, while the platoon penetration is above 60%, the lane change frequency of the platoon decreases with that. When the platoon size is large enough, the lane change frequency will reduce to zero. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The unmanned control of the steering wheel is, at present, one of the most important challenges facing researchers in autonomous vehicles within the field of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). In this paper, we present a two-layer control architecture for automatically moving the steering wheel of a mass-produced vehicle. The first layer is designed to calculate the target position of the steering wheel at any time and is based on fuzzy logic. The second is a classic control layer that moves the steering bar by means of an actuator to achieve the position targeted by the first layer. Real-time kinematic differential global positioning system (RTK-DGPS) equipment is the main sensor input for positioning. It is accurate to about 1 cm and can finely locate the vehicle trajectory. The developed systems are installed on a Citroen Berlingo van, which is used as a testbed vehicle. Once this control architecture has been implemented, installed, and tuned, the resulting steering maneuvering is very similar to human driving, and the trajectory errors from the reference route are reduced to a minimum. The experimental results show that the combination of GPS and artificial-intelligence-based techniques behaves outstandingly. We can also draw other important conclusions regarding the design of a control system derived from human driving experience, providing an alternative mathematical formalism for computation, human reasoning, and integration of qualitative and quantitative information.

AB Plenty of studies on exclusive lanes for Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) have been conducted recently about traffic efficiency and safety. However, most of the previous research studies neglected comprehensive consideration of the safety impact on different market penetration rates (MPRs) of CAVs, traffic demands, and proportion of trucks in mixture CAVs with human's driven vehicle environment. On this basis, this study is to (1) identify the safety impact on exclusive lanes for CAVs under different MPRs with different traffic demands and (2) investigate the safety impact of trucks for CAV exclusive lanes on mixture environment. Based on the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), a CAV platooning control algorithm is proposed for modeling the driving behaviors of CAVs. A calibrated 7-kilometer freeway section microscopic simulation environment is built by VISSIM. Four surrogate safety measures, including both longitudinal and lateral safety risk indexes, are employed to evaluate the overall safety impacts of setting exclusive lanes. Main results indicate that (1) setting one exclusive lane is capable to improve overall safety environment in low demand, and two exclusive lanes are more suitable for high-demand scenario; (2) existence of trucks worsens overall longitudinal safety environment, and improper setting of exclusive lanes in high trucks, low MPR scenario has adverse effect on longitudinal safety; and (3) setting exclusive lanes have better longitudinal and lateral safety improvement in high-truck proportion scenarios. Setting one or two exclusive lanes led to [+42.4% to -52.90%] and [+45.7% to -55.2%] of longitudinal risks while [-1.8% to -87.1%] and [-2.1% to -85.3%] of lateral conflicts compared with the base scenario, respectively. Results of this study provide useful insight for the setting of exclusive lanes for CAVs in a mixture environment.

The algorithm enables communication between searcher vehicle and candidate-vehicles whose origin node matches the destination node of the searcher vehicle, and traveling in the opposite direction. The data entities of knowledge sharing among the vehicles and the algorithmic procedure as well as the conditions for information sharing are presented in detail. The mathematical formulation of the procedure is also presented. A microscopic simulation model is utilized to assess the effectiveness of the algorithm against the benchmark shortest path algorithm. Average travel time, and overall network productivity are presented to measure the effectiveness of the algorithm. Simulation runs are conducted under various network congestion levels, link speeds and link lengths in order to evaluate the network productivity, and the travel time measures of the presented IVC algorithm compared to the benchmark shortest path algorithm, decentralized route guidance systems as well as other IVC-based algorithms.

ID EXTREMUM SEEKING; COORDINATION; SYSTEMS
AB We consider the problem of deploying a group of autonomous vehicles (agents) in a formation that has higher density near the source of a measurable signal and lower density away from the source. The spatial distribution of the signal and the location of the source are unknown, but the signal is known to decay with the distance from the source. The vehicles do not have the capability of sensing their own positions, but they are capable of sensing the distance between them and their neighbors. We design a control algorithm based on a combination of two components. One component of the control law is inspired by the heat partial differential equation (PDE) and results in the agents deploying between two anchor agents. The other component of the control law is based on extremum seeking and achieves higher vehicle density around the source. By using averaging theory for PDEs, we prove that the vehicle density will be highest around the source. We also quantify the density function of the agents' deployment position. By discretizing the model with respect to the continuous agent index, we obtain decentralized control laws for discrete agents and illustrate the theoretical results with simulations.

TI Approximating kinematics for tracked mobile robots
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE tracked vehicles; kinematic control; mobile robotics; parameter
   identification; dynamics simulation
AB In this paper we propose a kinematic approach for tracked mobile robots in order to improve motion control and pose estimation. Complex dynamics due to slippage and track-soil interactions make it difficult to predict the exact motion of the vehicle on the basis of track velocities. Nevertheless, real-time computations for autonomous navigation require an effective kinematics approximation without introducing dynamics in the loop. The proposed solution is based on the fact that the instantaneous centers of rotation (ICRs) of treads on the motion plane with respect to the vehicle are dynamics-dependent, but they lie within a bounded area. Thus, optimizing constant ICR positions for a particular terrain results in an approximate kinematic model for tracked mobile robots. Two different approaches are presented for off-line estimation of kinematic parameters: (i) simulation of the stationary response of the dynamic model for the whole velocity, range of the vehicle; (ii) introduction of an experimental setup so that a genetic algorithm can produce the model from actual sensor readings. These methods have been evaluated for on-line odometric computations and low-level motion control with the Auriga-alpha mobile robot on a hard-surface flat soil at moderate speeds.

TI Time-Dependent Performance Analysis of the 802.11p-Based Platooning
   Communications Under Disturbance
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE 802.11p; performance analysis; disturbance; platoon; time-dependent
   performance
AB Platooning is a critical technology to realize autonomous driving. Each vehicle in platoons adopts the IEEE 802.11p standard to exchange information through communications to maintain the string stability of platoons. However, one vehicle in platoons inevitably suffers from a disturbance resulting from the leader vehicle acceleration/deceleration, wind gust and uncertainties in a platoon control system, i.e., aerodynamics drag and rolling resistance moment etc. Disturbances acting on one vehicle may inevitably affect the following vehicles and cause that the spacing error is propagated or even amplified downstream along the platoon, i.e., platoon string instability. In this case, the connectivity among vehicles is dynamic, resulting in the performance of 802.11p in terms of packet delay and packet delivery ratio being time-varying. The effect of the string instability would be further deteriorated once the time-varying performance of 802.11p cannot satisfy the basic communication requirement. Unlike the existing works which only analyze the steady performance of 802.11p in vehicular networks, we will focus on the impact of disturbance and construct models to analyze the time-dependent performance of 802.11p-based platooning communications. The effectiveness of the models is validated through simulation results. Moreover, the time-dependent performance of 802.11p is analyzed through numerical results and it is validated that 802.11p is able to satisfy the communication requirement under disturbance.

AB Although driving behavior has been largely studied amongst private motor vehicles drivers, the literature addressing heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers is scarce. Identifying the existing groups of driving stereotypes and their proportions enables researchers, companies, and policy makers to establish group-specific strategies to improve safety and economy. In addition, insight into driving styles can help predict drivers' reactions and therefore enable the modeling of interactions between vehicles and the possible obstacles encountered on a journey. Consequently, there are also contributions to the research and development of autonomous vehicles and smart roads. In this paper, our interest lies in investigating driving behavior within the HGV community in the United Kingdom (U.K.). We conduct analysis of a telematics dataset containing the incident information on 21 193 HGV drivers across the U.K. We are interested in answering two research questions: 1) What groups of behavior are we able to uncover? 2) How do these groups complement current findings in the literature? To answer these questions, we apply a two-stage data analysis methodology involving consensus clustering and ensemble classification to the dataset. Through the analysis, eight patterns of behavior are uncovered. It is also observed that although our findings have similarities to those from previous work on driving behavior, further knowledge is obtained, such as extra patterns and driving traits arising from vehicle and road characteristics.

AB The Internet of vehicles (IoV) is an Internet-of-things-based network in the area of transportation. It comprises sensors, network communication, automation control, and data processing and enables connectivity between vehicles and other objects. This study performed main path analysis (MPA) to investigate the trajectory of research regarding the IoV. Studies were extracted from the Web of Science database, and citation networks among these studies were generated. MPA revealed that research in this field has mainly covered media access control, vehicle-to-vehicle channels, device-to-device communications, layers, non-orthogonal multiple access, and sixth-generation communications. Cluster analysis and data mining revealed that the main research topics related to the IoV included wireless channels, communication protocols, vehicular ad hoc networks, security and privacy, resource allocation and optimization, autonomous cruise control, deep learning, and edge computing. By using data mining and statistical analysis, we identified emerging research topics related to the IoV, namely blockchains, deep learning, edge computing, cloud computing, vehicular dynamics, and fifth- and sixth-generation mobile communications. These topics are likely to help drive innovation and the further development of IoV technologies and contribute to smart transportation, smart cities, and other applications. On the basis of the present results, this paper offers several predictions regarding the future of research regarding the IoV.

AB We focus on the pathways (affective vs. cognitive) that guide people's acceptance of road tests (ART) for self-driving vehicles (SDVs) and behavioral intention (BI) to use SDVs, and propose and test a psychological model to explain these two behavioral responses (i.e., ART and BI) based on the trust heuristic and affect heuristic. These heuristics suggest that affective factors (social trust, positive affect, and negative affect) can directly determine ART and BI following the affective pathway or indirectly influence them through two cognitive responses (perceived benefit and risk) following the cognitive pathway. We conducted a field study involving a Level 3 automated vehicle (AV), invited 300 participants to experience how an AV works in the self-driving mode, and collected their affective, cognitive, and behavioral responses related to SDVs before and after the AV experience. The AV experience increased the psychological model's explanatory power for perceived benefit, perceived risk, and ART. The affective pathway (vs. cognitive pathway) played a more important role in forming BI and ART. BI was predicted by perceived benefit, social trust, and positive affect, while ART was predicted by social trust and positive affect. The predictive ability of the model for BI and ART was validated. We discuss implications of the results for theory and practice.

AB A reactive collision avoidance algorithm is proposed to enable safe autonomous flight in the presence of multiple dynamic obstacles. A position-controlled hexacopter equipped with a visual sensor obtaining obstacle information is considered as an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platform. The proposed method centers on the concept of bounding tube which intrinsically extends the static bounding box to incorporate forthcoming movement of the obstacles into the collision avoidance framework. The processing pipeline consists of separate components for each of the sequential tasks in obstacle sensing and tracking. Computation of a spherical bounding box for each obstacle is followed by discrete-time Kalman filtering for prediction of obstacle trajectory to detect potential collision. If the current course of UAV turns out highly likely to end in collision with any of the obstacles, the vehicle steers to an aiming point chosen from among the bundle of candidates produced by constructing a bounding tube that takes account of predicted obstacle motion. The bounding-tube-based aiming point generation extends seamlessly to the case with multiple moving obstacles through running in series with multi-obstacle track management that combines hierarchical clustering of sensory data points for obstacle identification and a simple geometric method for data association. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed collision avoidance algorithm.

AB Autonomous and land vehicles' navigation in urban canyons requires aiding from other systems to the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). This kind of environment is characterised by containing high rise buildings and long tunnels which interfere with the GPS satellite's signals causing its partial or total blockage. Therefore, the utilisation of another positioning source with high fidelity solution is essential during long outage periods. The Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system is a critical unit in the Advanced Drive Assistant System. The ACC measures the relative speed and distance between the on-board vehicle and the vehicle in front. In this study, the ACC radar and an azimuth gyroscope are utilised to produce a self-contained positioning system. The position solution of this system is utilised to update the Inertial Navigation System during the GNSS outage periods. The proposed system was tested over real road trajectories which were conducted in an urban canyon to validate the efficiency of the system.

AB In this paper, an adaptive controller is developed for a fully actuated marine vehicle where the rigid body and hydrodynamic parameters are unknown. A data-based integral concurrent learning method is used to compensate for the uncertain parameters. A Lyapunov-based analysis is presented to show that the closed-loop system is globally exponentially stable and the uncertain parameters are identified exponentially without the requirement of persistence of excitation. Experimental results on an autonomous surface vessel operating on a lake illustrate the controller's ability to track figure-8 trajectories in environments with small disturbances.

AB We address the problem of autonomous landing of a quadrotor onto a heaving (moving vertically) platform in this paper. A control architecture that consists of a motion estimation module, a trajectory generation module and a tracking control module is proposed. The motion estimation module estimates the absolute motion of the platform and the quadrotor with the measurements from an on-board accelerometer and vision measurements. Based on these estimates, the trajectory generation module generates a time-optimal reference trajectory. With the reference trajectory and motion estimation, the tracking control module synthesizes a control command that enables robust tracking of the reference trajectory. Experimental results and comparison with a state-of-the-art landing controller demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control architecture.

AB Because of the limited and unreliable communication topology in complex marine environment, the formation control of marine vehicles under switching topology is investigated in this paper, whereas the most previous works for marine formation focused on the fixed communication topology. In order to simplify the formation control design, a novel distributed guidance system, rather than the traditional distributed control system, is established based on leader-follower strategy only using a portion of communication links. To address the problem of input saturation of marine vehicle, the model predictive control is therefore employed to design the marine formation controller; furthermore, the predictive mechanism allows model predictive control to prevent the constraint violation in advance, which brings advantages against the large inertia of ship motion. Both formation tracking control and formation regulation control are studied herein. For application of formation tracking control of marine vehicles, i.e., the time-varying reference signal, the formation control can be realized under switching topology with the condition that the communication topology contains a directed spanning tree. For application of formation regulation control of marine vehicles, i.e., the constant reference signal, the formation control can be realized under switching topology with a relative milder condition that the union of communication topology contains a directed spanning tree. Multiple simulations are included to show the effectiveness of the presented distributed guidance-based MPC formation controllers.

AB This paper proposes a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) algorithm for the formation flight of a group of UAVs modeled by six degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) spatial kinematics. The formation system has a leader-follower structure with the leader cruising at a constant linear velocity during the flight, and the UAVs transmit data in a unidirectional order. The DMPC algorithm utilizes the unidirectional structure through the reception and transmission of an assumed output sequence as the reference trajectory, which is constructed from the solutions to the local DMPC problem and the prediction model. Based on the interactions between UAVs, convergence and stability of the multi-UAV formation are ensured by the terminal constraints and recursive feasibility of the DMPC optimization. Simulations involving time-delays, packet drops and turbulence effect are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Comparisons with non-unidirectional data transmissions further demonstrate that the unidirectional structure plays a critical role in the convergence performance.

AB Current research on Deep ReinforcementLearning (DRL) for automated on-ramp merging neglects vehicle powertrain and dynamics. This work considers automated on-ramp merging for a power-split Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV), the 2015 Toyota Prius Plug-In, using DRL. The on-ramp merging control and the PHEV energy management are co-optimized such that the DRL policy directly outputs the power split between the engine and the electric motor. The testing results show that DRL can be successfully used for co-optimization, leading to collision-free on-ramp merging. When compared with sequential approaches wherein the upper-level on-ramp merging control and the lower-level PHEV energy management are performed independently and in sequence, we found that co-optimization results in economic but jerky on-ramp merging while sequential approaches may result in collisions due to neglecting powertrain power limit constraints in designing the upper-level on-ramp merging controller.

AB In a vehicular platoon, the lead vehicle that is responsible for managing the platoon's moving directions and velocity periodically disseminates messages to the following automated vehicles in a multi-hop vehicular network. However, due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels, this kind of communication is vulnerable to eavesdropping and message modification. Generating secret keys by extracting the shared randomness in a wireless fading channel is a promising way for wireless communication security. We study a security protocol for data dissemination in the platoon, where the vehicles cooperatively generate a shared secret key based on the quantized fading channel randomness. To improve conformity of the generated key, the probability of secret key agreement is formulated, and a novel secret key agreement algorithm is proposed to recursively optimize the channel quantization intervals, maximizing the key agreement probability. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the key agreement probability achieved by our security protocol given different platoon size, channel quality, and number of quantization intervals. Furthermore, by applying our security protocol, the probability that the encrypted data being cracked by an eavesdropper is less than 5%.

AB This study presents H-infinity control synthesis of a miniature unmanned aerial vehicle to improve its hovering capability in the presence of wind disturbances. By time-scale techniques, the six-degree-freedom flight system can be decoupled into subsystems in different time-scales: one including slow-varying translational dynamics and Euler angles, and another composed of fast-varying angular velocities. To avoid contradictions between subsystems, control specifications for subsystems are classified, respectively, in disjoint frequency ranges. Robust H controllers, applied directly to the original flight system, are formulated by composing the sub-controllers. To achieve desired handling and flying qualities, wind characteristics are considered, and a novel flexible strategy is then developed to ensure an adequate response in all flight modes under different weather conditions. The effectiveness and merits of the proposed methods are illustrated with a simulation example.

AB Purpose - This paper aims to address three major issues in the development of a vision-based navigation system for small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) which can be characterized as follows: technical constraints, robust image feature matching and an efficient and precise method for visual navigation.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors present and evaluate methods for their solution such as wireless networked control, highly distinctive feature descriptors (HDF) and a visual odometry system.
   Findings - Proposed feature descriptors achieve significant improvements in computation time by detaching the explicit scale invariance of the widely used scale invariant feature transform. The feasibility of wireless networked real-time control for vision-based navigation is evaluated in terms of latency and data throughput.

AB Intelligent transportation system (ITS) is a key enabler for future road traffic management systems. The core components of ITS include vehicles, roadside units, and traffic command centers. They generate a large amount of data flow that is made up of both mobility and service-related data. Therefore, some data science methods to handle the transportation data are very necessary for ITS. Although some attempts have been done to explore data science methods for ITS, there exist various scientific and engineering challenges including software and hardware development, computational complexity, data multi-source heterogeneity, and privacy protection. Consequently, to fully explore the benefits of ITS applications like connected and autonomous vehicles, traffic control and prediction, road safety, and accident prediction, advanced data science methodologies and applications are in great need.

AB Priority and mutual interaction among vehicles are crucial for the efficiency and safety control of unsignalized intersections. However, most of the approaches for intersection cooperation are based on first-come-first-served (FCFS) rules, neglecting the influence caused by different priorities. Focusing on the priority and mutual interaction between connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), this paper proposes a game-based hierarchical control strategy to improve the traveling efficiency at unsignalized intersections. The three-layered hierarchical strategy includes the priority negotiation layer (PNL), strategy bargaining layer (SBL) and strategy optimization layer (SOL), respectively. In the PNL, a game-theoretic strategy is designed for priority negotiation, in which the most efficient crossing order is sought by the Pareto-optimal set. In the SBL, with the assigned negotiated priority, a bargaining game is designed for further interaction between CAVs. In the SOL, model predictive control is applied for strategy optimization considering the comfort of drivers and executability of vehicles. Two cases of cooperative intersection, in which fixed priority with comparison of the Nash game method and greedy method, and negotiated priority with comparison of fixed priority are carried out in a hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) test. The results demonstrate that the traffic efficiency is improved with safety guaranteed by the proposed hierarchical strategy.

AB As one of important implications on electric vehicles, driving cycles are recognized as essential components for evaluating the comprehensive performances and they have drawn much attention for research. Currently, driving cycles are constructed specifiedly in international standards based on local traffic conditions. However, without consideration of the private driving habits, unproper cycles lead to the imprecision on predicting the remaining useful life or estimating states. Herein, a novel methodology based on Markov chain and Monte Carlo method is developed to extract the personal driving characteristics as the elements of divided kinematic fragments. Principal component analysis is adopted to address the high-dimensional parameter vector, and cluster is used to classify the kinematic fragments. The statistics analysis demonstrates that the processed database exhibits great consistency with our developed driving cycle compared against original database, where temperature, state-of-charge and consistency are utilized to describe the personal patterns. Moreover, by using the operational driving data, the developed driving cycle is comparable against other driving cycles, which exhibits good performance. Overall, the presented driving cycle of electric vehicle can be considered as an effective way in evaluating the private driving habits, predicting the battery states and other related applications. The method may be promoted for future better energy management on electric vehicles owing to the promotion of connected and autonomous vehicles.

AB Autonomous vehicles depend on global positioning systems' aided by motion sensors to estimate its position within the traffic network. However, all the driving vehicles cannot be ensured to have satellite visibility. Therefore, in order to increase the accuracy and robustness of vehicle localization, it is important to have an assistant localization method for these systems by using some environmental sensing, such as cameras and radars. In this paper, we look at using multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar for vehicle localization. The performance of cross localization in MIMO radar relies on the accuracy of the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. But the performance of most existing DOA estimation methods based on sparse signal recover is affected by the unknown nonuniform noise and mutual coupling. The proposed method uses a linear transformation to eliminate the influence of mutual coupling by utilizing the banded complex symmetric Toeplitz structure of the mutual coupling matrices in both transmit and receive arrays. Then, a real-valued covariance vector-based sparse Bayesian learning framework is formulated for DOA estimation by utilizing the unitary transformation, in which the variances of nonuniform noise can be updated by using the least square strategy. The proposed method can work well and provide better DOA estimation performance than the existing sparse signal recover-based algorithms in unknown mutual coupling and nonuniform noise. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method.

AB Vehicle dynamic states and parameters, such as the tyre-road friction coefficient and body's sideslip angle especially, are crucial for vehicle dynamics control with close-loop feedback laws. Autonomous vehicles also have strict demands on real-time knowledge of those information to make reliable decisions. With consideration of the cost saving, some estimation methods employing high-resolution vision and position devices are not for the production vehicles. Meanwhile, the bad adaptability of traditional Kalman filters to variable system structure restricts their practical applications. This paper introduces a cost-efficient estimation scheme using on-board sensors. Improved Strong Tracking Unscented Kalman filter is constructed to estimate the friction coefficient with fast convergence rate on time-variant road surfaces. On the basis of previous step, an estimator based on interactive multiple model is built to tolerant biased noise covariance matrices and observe body's sideslip angle. After the vehicle modelling errors are considered, a Self-Correction Data Fusion algorithm is developed to integrate results of the estimator and direct integral method with error correction theory. Some simulations and experiments are also implemented, and their results verify the high accuracy and good robustness of the cooperative estimation scheme.

AB To enable large-scale and ubiquitous automotive network access, traditional vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies are evolving to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) for increasing demands on emerging advanced vehicular applications, such as intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and autonomous vehicles. In recent years, IoV technologies have been developed and achieved significant progress. However, it is still unclear what is the evolution path and what are the challenges and opportunities brought by IoV. For the aforementioned considerations, this article provides a thorough survey on the historical process and status quo of V2X technologies, as well as demonstration of emerging technology developing directions toward IoV. We first review the early stage when the dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) was issued as an important initial beginning and compared the cellular V2X with IEEE 802.11 V2X communications in terms of both the pros and cons. In addition, considering the advent of big data and cloud-edge regime, we highlight the key technical challenges and pinpoint the opportunities toward the big data-driven IoV and cloud-based IoV, respectively. We believe our comprehensive survey on evolutionary V2X technologies toward IoV can provide beneficial insights and inspirations for both academia and the IoV industry.

AB This paper investigates the collaborative control of vehicular traffic for a signal-free intersection. The traffic under consideration is mixed with connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human-piloted vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The proposed collaborative control is of two levels. At the upper level, the objective is to minimize total delay via platoon control and dynamic priority control of conflicting movements. We formulate the platoon coordination of mixed traffic as a mixed-integer linear programming problem (MILP). This MILP determines whether adjacent vehicles will form a platoon and prioritize any two conflicting movements subject to lateral safety and rear-end safety constraints. At the lower level, we propose an eco-driving strategy to minimize the energy consumption by optimizing the speed profile of the platoon leading vehicles subject to the dynamic priority control from the upper level, i.e., the entry time to the merging zone. We deduce an analytical solution to the eco-driving problem using optimal control theory. Compared with existing benchmarks, such as the first-come-first-served policy, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art controllers in reducing the total delay. Sensitivity analysis regarding the penetration rate of CAVs shows that substantial improvements can be achieved even at low to medium penetration rates of CAVs.

AB Performance improvement of advanced driver assistance systems yields two major benefits: increasingly rapid progress towards autonomous driving and a simultaneous advance in vehicle safety. Integration of multiple advanced driver assistance systems leads to the so-called automated driving system, which can intervene jointly on braking and steering to avert impending crashes. Nevertheless, obstacles such as stationary vehicles and buildings can interpose between the opponent vehicles and the working field of advanced driver assistance systems' sensors, potentially resulting in an inevitable collision state. Currently available devices cannot properly handle an inevitable collision state, because its occurrence is not subject to evaluations by the system. In the present work, criteria for intervention on braking and steering are introduced, based on the vehicle occupants' injury risk. The system must monitor the surrounding and act on the degrees of freedom adapting to the evolution of the scenario, following an adaptive logic. The model-in-the-loop, software-in-the-loop and hardware-in-the-loop for such adaptive intervention are first introduced. To highlight the potential benefits offered by the adaptive advanced driver assistance systems, simulation software has been developed. The adaptive logic has been tested in correspondence of three inevitable collision state conditions between two motor vehicles: at each instant, the adaptive logic attitude of creating impact configurations associated with minimum injury risk is ultimately demonstrated.

AB Climate change, the emission of greenhouse gases, and air pollution are some of the most important and challenging environmental issues. One of the main sources of such problems is the field of transportation, which leads to the emission of greenhouse gases. An efficient way to deal with such problems is carrying out sustainable transportation to reduce the amount of air pollution in an efficient way. The evaluation of sustainable vehicles can be considered a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method due to the existence of several criteria. In this paper, we aim to provide an approach based on MCDM methods and the spherical fuzzy set (SFS) concept to evaluate and prioritize sustainable vehicles for a transportation system in Tehran, Iran. Therefore, we have developed a new integrated approach based on the stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) and the measurement of alternatives and ranking according to the compromise solution (MARCOS) methods in SFS to assess the sustainable vehicles based on the criteria identified by experts. The evaluation results show that the main criterion of the environment has a high degree of importance compared to other criteria. Moreover, autonomous vehicles are the best and most sustainable vehicles to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, by comparing the ranking results with other decision-making methods, it was found that the proposed approach has high validity and efficiency.

AB In order to solve the problems of longitudinal and lateral control coupling, low accuracy and poor real-time of existing control strategy in the process of active collision avoidance, a longitudinal and lateral collision avoidance control strategy of intelligent vehicle based on model predictive control is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the vehicle nonlinear coupling dynamics model is established. Secondly, considering the accuracy and real-time requirements of intelligent vehicle motion control in pedestrian crossing scene, and combining the advantages of centralized control and decentralized control, an integrated unidirectional decoupling compensation motion control strategy is proposed. The proposed strategy uses two pairs of unidirectional decoupling compensation controllers to realize the mutual integration and decoupling in both longitudinal and lateral directions. Compared with centralized control, it simplifies the design of controller, retains the advantages of centralized control, and improves the real-time performance of control. Compared with the decentralized control, it considers the influence of longitudinal and lateral control, retains the advantages of decentralized control, and improves the control accuracy. Finally, the proposed control strategy is simulated and analyzed in six working conditions, and compared with the existing control strategy. The results show that the proposed control strategy is obviously better than the existing control strategy in terms of control accuracy and real-time performance, and can effectively improve vehicle safety and stability.

AB In this paper, a computationally efficient chance-constrained rollover-free motion planning method is presented. Specifically, the method is developed to plan motions for reconfigurable vehicles with the knowledge of a 3-D terrain model that has limited accuracy. The overall motion planning problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimal control problem (NOCP) that employs a constraint in the form of a bound on the probability of rollover under terrain-induced vehicle orientation uncertainty. To increase the computational efficiency of the NOCP with nonlinear chance constraint, a geometric interpretation of the chance constraint is derived based on the characteristics of SO(3), the 3-D rotation group. Monte Carlo simulations are provided to demonstrate the usefulness of the geometric interpretation through comparisons with other methods. Experimental data gathered from driving a mobile robot through real forests are also used to validate the proposed model. Finally, path and trajectory generation results obtained with the proposed planning method for a feller-buncher machine traversing through uncertain 3-D terrain are presented to showcase the method's overall performance and efficiency.

AB The problem of neural adaptive distributed formation control is investigated for quadrotor multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) subject to unmodeled dynamics and disturbance. The quadrotor UAV system is divided into two parts: the position subsystem and the attitude subsystem. A virtual position controller based on backstepping is designed to address the coupling constraints and generate two command signals for the attitude subsystem. By establishing the communication mechanism between the UAVs and the virtual leader, a distributed formation scheme, which uses the UAVs' local information and makes each UAV update its position and velocity according to the information of neighboring UAVs, is proposed to form the required formation flight. By designing a neural adaptive sliding mode controller (SMC) for multi-UAVs, the compound uncertainties (including nonlinearities, unmodeled dynamics, and external disturbances) are compensated for to guarantee good tracking performance. The Lyapunov theory is used to prove that the tracking error of each UAV converges to an adjustable neighborhood of zero. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB Dynamic trajectory planning (DTP) and Dynamic trajectory tracking (DTT) are the real-time mutual coupling in the process of the dynamic lateral obstacle avoidance (DLOA) of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Meanwhile, the varying velocity and acceleration of obstacle vehicles (OVs) increase the difficulties of DTP. Furthermore, the parameters perturbation in CAVs (such as mass and cornering stiffness), the varying velocities of CAVs and the signal disturbances, raise the difficulties of DTT. Therefore, the DLOA is challenging due to the interaction of the above multiple factors. To address the problem, this paper proposes a robust gain-scheduling control strategy of DLOA for CAVs. The strategy is divided into two modules namely DTP and DTT, and the two modules cooperate with each other in real time. In the module of DTP, the optimal trajectory considering the efficiency, passenger comfort and safety is real-time optimized in the dynamic safe limit which is real time predicted according to the information from CAVs and OVs. In the module of DTT, the real-time trajectory reference is tracked. Robust gain-scheduling control is realized to cope with variation of real-time trajectory reference, varying velocity, parameters perturbation and signal disturbances during the process of DLOA. The simulation results indicate that the strategy can effectively achieve DLOA maintaining the vehicle stability across various working conditions.

ID CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS
AB Vehicle detection is a crucial task for autonomous driving and demands high accuracy and real-time speed. Considering that the current deep learning object detection model size is too large to be deployed on the vehicle, this paper introduces the lightweight network to modify the feature extraction layer of YOLOv3 and improve the remaining convolution structure, and the improved Lightweight YOLO network reduces the number of network parameters to a quarter. Then, the license plate is detected to calculate the actual vehicle width and the distance between the vehicles is estimated by the width. This paper proposes a detection and ranging fusion method based on two different focal length cameras to solve the problem of difficult detection and low accuracy caused by a small license plate when the distance is far away. The experimental results show that the average precision and recall of the Lightweight YOLO trained on the self-built dataset is 4.43% and 3.54% lower than YOLOv3, respectively, but the computing speed of the network decreases 49 ms per frame. The road experiments in different scenes also show that the long and short focal length camera fusion ranging method dramatically improves the accuracy and stability of ranging. The mean error of ranging results is less than 4%, and the range of stable ranging can reach 100 m. The proposed method can realize real-time vehicle detection and ranging on the on-board embedded platform Jetson Xavier, which satisfies the requirements of automatic driving environment perception.

AB This paper presents an intelligent adaptive trajectory tracking controller using fuzzy basis function networks (FBFN) for an autonomous small-scale helicopter. The FNFN is used online to learn the vehicle mass and the coupling effect between the force and the moments, and the intelligent adaptive controller then is synthesized systematically using a backstepping technique. This controller is designed to accomplish the ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop helicopter dynamics and accommodate agile flight maneuvers. Two nonlinear simulations on hovering and trajectory tracking are conducted to show the effectiveness and merit of the proposed controller, which is also shown to be superior by performance comparison with a well-known neural-network controller.

TI Underwater gliders for ocean research
SO MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Underwater gliders are autonomous vehicles that profile vertically by controlling buoyancy and move horizontally on wings. Gliders are reviewed, from their conception by Henry Stommel as an extension of autonomous profiling floats, through their development in three models and including their first deployments singly and in numbers. The basics of glider function are discussed as implemented by University of Washington in Seaglider, Scripps Institution of Oceanography in Spray, and Webb Research in Slocum. Gliders sample in the archetypical-modes of sections and of "virtual moorings." Preliminary results are presented from a recent demonstration project that used a network of gliders off Monterey. A wide range of sensors has already been deployed on gliders, with many under current development, and an even wider range of future possibilities. Glider networks appear to be one of the best approaches to achieving subsurface spatial resolution necessary for ocean research.

AB This paper presents a comparative study on the effects of the input configurations of linear quadratic (LQ) controllers on path tracking performance under low friction conditions. For the last decade, the path tracking controller has adopted several control inputs, input configurations, and actuators. However, these have not been compared with one another on a single frame in terms of common measures. For this reason, this paper compares input configurations of LQ controllers and available actuators in terms of common measures. For this purpose, the control inputs of the LQ controller were composed of front and rear steering and control yaw moment. By combining these control inputs, five input configurations of the LQ controller were set. If the control yaw moment is selected as a control input, then an actuator is needed to generate a control allocation, which should be adopted to convert the control yaw moment into longitudinal and lateral tire forces of actuators. As an actuator for control yaw moment generation, front/rear and 4-wheel steering, 4-wheel independent steering, braking, and driving were adopted. By applying the weighted least square based method, control allocation was formulated as a quadratic programming problem, which can be algebraically solved. For comparison on path tracking performance, new measures were adopted. To check the path tracking performance of each input configuration, a simulation was conducted on vehicle simulation software. From the simulation results, it was shown that front or 4-wheel steering itself is enough for path tracking on low friction roads and that the control yaw moment or an additional actuator is not recommended as a control input for path tracking on low friction roads.

ID NAVIGATION; IMPACT
AB The goal of underwater docking is to safely insert an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) into the docking sleeve of a docking station (DS). However, AUVs frequently experience disturbances in their operating environment under motional constraints owing to their shapes, which can significantly impede successful docking missions. Therefore, it is essential to develop an assessment method and corresponding index representing feasibility. In this study, we suggest a new assessment method and a probability-based assessment index to assess the underwater docking process, considering aforementioned motional constraints. The assessment is made for both the position and heading angle of the AUV, with the results presented in probabilistic figures. These figures are used to estimate the assessment index, which represents the probability of successful docking. The final decision on whether to dock or not can be made based on this index. When the index exceeds a predefined threshold, it indicates that the current docking process is reliable, and the docking will be successful. The suggested assessment method and the index were validated through tests conducted in various underwater environments. The results show that the probability-based index estimated through the proposed method can be grounds for successful docking.

AB In order to solve the problem of inconsistent state estimation when multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are co-located, this paper proposes a method of multi-AUV co-location based on the consistent extended Kalman filter (EKF). Firstly, the dynamic model of cooperative positioning system follower AUV under two leaders alternately transmitting navigation information is established. Secondly, the observability of the standard linearization estimator based on the lead-follower multi-AUV cooperative positioning system is analyzed by comparing the subspace of the observable matrix of state estimation with that of an ideal observable matrix, it can be concluded that the estimation of state by standard EKF is inconsistent. Finally, aiming at the problem of inconsistent state estimation, a consistent EKF multi-AUV cooperative localization algorithm is designed. The algorithm corrects the linearized measurement values in the Jacobian matrix for cooperative positioning, ensuring that the linearized estimator can obtain accurate measurement values. The positioning results of the follower AUV under dead reckoning, standard EKF, and consistent EKF algorithms are simulated, analyzed, and compared with the real trajectory of the following AUV. The simulation results show that the follower AUV with a consistent EKF algorithm can keep synchronization with the leader AUV more stably.

AB A multiobjective, risk-aware framework is developed for optimal path planning of autonomous underwater vehicles operating in uncertain current. The uncertainty in the current is described in terms of a finite ensemble of flow realizations. A new optimization framework is proposed that accounts for the full variability of the ensemble in a single optimization problem whose solution may not necessarily coincide with any of the optimal deterministic paths corresponding to individual ensemble members. We formulate stochastic problemsthat aim to minimize a risk measure of the travel time or energy consumption, using a flexible methodology that enables the user to seamlessly explore various objectives, ranging from risk neutral to risk averse. We illustrate the application of the proposed approach using two case studies based on synthetic 2-D settings, and one case involving a real-world problem in the Gulf of Aden. The results are analyzed to assess the value of stochastic solution, guide the selection of suitable risk measures, and demonstrate the impact of the risk measures on the resulting path and on the distribution of travel times.

AB Understanding drivers' behavioral characteristics is critical for the design of decision-making modules in autonomous vehicles (AVs) and advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs). Current relevant studies are mainly based on supervised learning methods which involve extensive human efforts in model development. This paper proposed a framework for automatic descriptive driving pattern extraction from driving sequence data using unsupervised algorithms. Based on the Bayesian multivariate linear regression model, two unsupervised algorithms were utilized to segment driving sequences into fragments. Three extended latent Dirichlet allocation models were applied to cluster the fragments into multiple descriptive driving patterns. The collected driving data from a naturalistic driving experiment was applied to examine the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Results show that the unsupervised segmentation algorithms could help effectively detect the switch characteristics between two continuous driving maneuvers along time, and the clustered patterns could effectively describe the characteristics of each driving maneuver. The proposed unsupervised framework provides an effective and efficient data mining solution to facilitating deep and comprehensive understanding on drivers' behavioral char-acteristics, which will benefit the development of AVs and ADASs.

AB In Autonomous Driving (AD), detection and tracking of obstacles on the roads is a critical task. Deep-learning based methods using annotated LiDAR data have been the most widely adopted approach for this. Unfortunately, annotating 3D point cloud is a very challenging, time- and money-consuming task. In this letter, we propose a novel LiDAR simulator that augments real point cloud with synthetic obstacles (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, and other movable objects). Unlike previous simulators that entirely rely on CG (Computer Graphics) models and game engines, our augmented simulator bypasses the requirement to create high-fidelity background CAD (Computer Aided Design) models. Instead, we can deploy a vehicle with a LiDAR scanner to sweep the street of interests to obtain the background points cloud, based on which annotated point cloud can be automatically generated. This "scan-and-simulate" capability makes our approach scalable and practical, ready for large-scale industrial applications. In this letter, we describe our simulator in detail, in particular the placement of obstacles that is critical for performance enhancement. We show that detectors with our simulated LiDAR point cloud alone can perform comparably (within two percentage points) with these trained with real data. Mixing real and simulated data can achieve over 95% accuracy.

DE A* algorithm; seafloor classification; sidescan sonar scanlines;
   submarine cable route design
AB This work presents an efficient method for designing submarine cable routes using online seafloor classification based on sidescan sonar scanlines, collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Currently, the cable routes are designed manually by experienced experts. Online seafloor classification and an automated route planning method using an AUV can improve the efficiency of construction of submarine cables. Sidescan sonar is a device commonly used for mapping the seafloor and detecting obstacles. An AUV equipped with a sidescan sonar is used to gather sonar scanlines to perform online seafloor classification and mapping. As the AUV operates, the gathered scanlines are analyzed to classify the seafloor using a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with the naive assumption. Based on the seafloor classification map, a probabilistic roadmap is generated. Then, an A* algorithm is applied to determine appropriate cable routes along the cable corridor, using the following five factors: seafloor classification, bathymetry, steepness of slope, angle of change of course, and cable length. Compared with an existing route planning method, the presented method of using an AUV with automatic decision making algorithm can efficiently support submarine cable construction. The favored route determined by the presented method was as acceptable as the route designed by experts.

TI Certification and Software Verification Considerations for Autonomous
   Unmanned Aircraft
SO JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Software verification for highly automatic unmanned aerial vehicles is not only a problem itself, it is furthermore constrained by certification standards and regulatory rules. These, however, are themselves still under development. As a top-level view, the current status of unmanned aerial vehicle verification, certification, and regulation is addressed and corresponding challenges are discussed. From a low-level view, this work presents the processes and tools that were established for the software development, verification, and validation of the unmanned rotorcraft software testbed ARTIS. Large efforts have been put into the software verification process to cope with the growing complexity of the autonomous system and the validation of the software behavior. Automated tests drive the development of the mission planning, mission management, and sensor fusion systems. High-level behavior is tested by complex simulation scenarios. To connect the aforementioned top-and low-level views, a comparison between the RTCA DO-178C standard ("Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification") and corresponding ARTIS software development practices is elaborated to assess the efforts that would be necessary for a small research team to develop software according to the standard. It shows that the currently used practices are not incompatible, but there are still some gaps to the desired level of compliance.

AB To improve the autonomous flight capability of endo-atmospheric flight vehicles, such as cruise missiles, drones, and other small, low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), a novel minimum-effort waypoint-following differential geometric guidance law (MEWFDGGL) is proposed in this paper. Using the classical differential geometry curve theory, the optimal guidance problem of endo-atmospheric flight vehicles is transformed into an optimal space curve design problem, where the guidance command is the curvature. On the one hand, the change in speed of the flight vehicle is decoupled from the guidance problem. In this way, the widely adopted constant speed hypothesis in the process of designing the guidance law is eliminated, and, hence, the performance of the proposed MEWFDGGL is not influenced by the varying speed of the flight vehicle. On the other hand, considering the onboard computational burden, a suboptimal form of the MEWFDGGL is proposed to solve the problem, where both the complexity and the computational burden of the guidance law dramatically increase as the number of waypoints increases. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that both the original MEWFDGGL and its suboptimal form can be applied to general waypoint-following tasks with an arbitrary number of waypoints. Finally, the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed MEWFDGGL are verified by a numerical simulation and flight experiments.

   navigation; Autonomous navigation; Event detection
AB A wireless sensor network has the ability to autonomously perform event detection over large areas, but power and/or cost constraints limit the addition of equipment such as cameras onto sensor modules to verify events. Accordingly, verification must be performed by an independent mobile robotic vehicle which has sensing equipment for improved event detection. The main challenge, however, is that the robotic vehicle itself is typically located somewhere in the sensor field and has no prior knowledge of the geographic location of the event. In this paper, we specifically focus upon the scenario of navigating a robotic vehicle through a stationary wireless sensor network as a means to perform event verification. The underlying assumptions are that the robotic vehicle has distance traveled and heading measurements, but the only additional information provided by the stationary sensors is a communication boundary. More significantly, we emphasize that under this scenario, neither the robot nor the ground-fixed sensing nodes have location or any other geographical landmark information. The paper introduces two distinct and novel navigation algorithms that permit the robotic vehicle to travel from one fixed node to another along a communication path established in an ad-hoc fashion. These navigation algorithms have been tested on a newly developed UTrekr robotic vehicle within a hardware based ground-fixed sensor network and under assumption of perfect communication and network operations, we report a nearly 100% success rate even while using open-loop robot control.

AB This study proposes a parent-child robot-based underwater manipulation system for underwater structure maintenance comprising two underwater vehicles with split roles. The larger autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) acts as the base to transport and control a tethered child robot that is deployed to perform actual manipulation tasks. Conventional AUVs face several challenges when performing manipulation missions because of their large and massive body and the complexity of dynamic control with a rigid arm manipulator in the precise hovering state. To address this problem, we proposed an underwater manipulation system that uses a large parent AUV with high-performance sensors to navigate to the desired location and a child robot with high mobility to perform manipulation tasks. In this study, a parent-child robot-based manipulation system was developed and mathematically modeled considering hydrodynamics. Based on the system model, nonlinear time delay (TD) controller was applied to the child robot to ensure robustness of the movement, and complementary sensing methods were proposed according to the observation distance. Subsequently, we detailed the mission process such that the manipulation tasks could be performed autonomously. To implement and verify the proposed method, we conducted three-dimensional (3D) simulations, water tank experiments, and sea trials. In the 3D simulation and water tank experiments, we evaluated the position control using a TD controller during a specific disturbance and performed an operational evaluation of the parent-child system. In the water tank, we performed the operation of the child robot with the tether length adjustment of the winch system and the manipulation task. In the sea trial, the predefined mission was successfully completed, which demonstrated the feasibility of properly operating both the robots. The results of the experiments demonstrated the high potential and capabilities of the proposed manipulation system.

AB People seem to hold the human driver to be primarily responsible when their partially automated vehicle crashes, yet is this reasonable? While the driver is often required to immediately take over from the automation when it fails, placing such high expectations on the driver to remain vigilant in partially automated driving is unreasonable. Drivers show difficulties in taking over control when needed immediately, potentially resulting in dangerous situations. From a normative perspective, it would be reasonable to consider the impact of automation on the driver's ability to take over control when attributing responsibility for a crash. We, therefore, analyzed whether the public indeed considers driver ability when attributing responsibility to the driver, the vehicle, and its manufacturer. Participants blamed the driver primarily, even though they recognized the driver's decreased ability to avoid the crash. These results portend undesirable situations in which users of partially driving automation are the ones held responsible, which may be unreasonable due to the detrimental impact of driving automation on human drivers. Lastly, the outcome signals that public awareness of such human-factors issues with automated driving should be improved.

AB In this paper, we propose a progressive model predictive control scheme (PMPCS) by considering the cooperative control of local planning and path tracking for intelligent vehicles. An improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) based model predictive control (MPC) method is developed to solve the planning and tracking problem. With the PMPCS, the total computational burden can be reduced sharply because of the seamless connection and mutual promotion between the optimization of two layers. Besides we also propose a novel planning algorithm, which can take traffic lights and overtaking time constraint into account. To solve these problems, we first combine model predictive control with artificial potential field (APF) to get a collision-free path by treating the time-varying safety constraints as the scope of the repulsive force and an asymmetrical lane potential field function. Furthermore, the pseudo velocity planning method is adopted to take traffic lights into account in the planning module. Simulation results show the reliability of the proposed algorithm and the advantages of the scheme compared with general hierarchical algorithm.

AB The self-organization of multiple autonomous mobile agents is a trending topic nowadays with applications in robotics, aerospace engineering, and satellite formations. We investigate a model of particles with coupled-oscillators dynamics focusing on the particular case of agents grouping in symmetric clusters while moving in concentric circular trajectories. Our results reveal that certain regions of the parameter space are more suitable for the onset of such clusters. Additionally, we study the effects of adding and removing agents from already formed clusters, prescribe a strategy to properly switch from one formation to another, and finally introduce an approach to obtain chaotic almost-circular trajectories and symmetric clusters with non-overlapping particles.

AB The cooperative positioning problem of hypersonic vehicles regarding LEO constellations is the focus of this research study on space-based early warning systems. A hypersonic vehicle is highly maneuverable, and its trajectory is uncertain. New challenges are posed for the cooperative positioning capability of the constellation. In recent years, breakthroughs in artificial intelligence technology have provided new avenues for collaborative multi-satellite intelligent autonomous decision-making technology. This paper addresses the problem of multi-satellite cooperative geometric positioning for hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs) by the LEO-constellation-tracking system. To exploit the inherent advantages of hierarchical reinforcement learning in intelligent decision making while satisfying the constraints of cooperative observations, an autonomous intelligent decision-making algorithm for satellites that incorporates a hierarchical proximal policy optimization with random hill climbing (MAPPO-RHC) is designed. On the one hand, hierarchical decision making is used to reduce the solution space; on the other hand, it is used to maximize the global reward and to uniformly distribute satellite resources. The single-satellite local search method improves the capability of the decision-making algorithm to search the solution space based on the decision-making results of the hierarchical proximal policy-optimization algorithm, combining both random hill climbing and heuristic methods. Finally, the MAPPO-RHC algorithm's coverage and positioning accuracy performance is simulated and analyzed in two different scenarios and compared with four intelligent satellite decision-making algorithms that have been studied in recent years. From the simulation results, the decision-making results of the MAPPO-RHC algorithm can obtain more balanced resource allocations and higher geometric positioning accuracy. Thus, it is concluded that the MAPPO-RHC algorithm provides a feasible solution for the real-time decision-making problem of the LEO constellation early warning system.
